Superb Sound Quality. The Ease of use all around is like riding on a cloud, Absolutely Sublime. As an Audiophile I'm also very Impressed by Bose's Immersive Audio Technology, it really makes you feel like your there 1 on 1 with your favorite Musician. The Bose App makes using them super easy to learn and customize, like custom touch controls for both earbuds and volume controls. If your in the market for Earbuds with Ultra Top-Of-The-Line sound quality and overall Premium feel, These Earbuds are the answer. I will be getting their Over-the-ear headphones in the future."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for a while now, and I’m absolutely impressed. These earbuds are incredibly comfortable, making them perfect for long listening sessions, and they stay securely in place even during intense workouts. The sound quality is outstanding, with deep, rich bass and crystal-clear highs that make every track come to life. Whether I’m running, lifting, or just relaxing, these earbuds deliver an exceptional audio experience. If you’re looking for a combination of comfort and superior sound quality, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a must-have.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using these Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for over a year now, and they continue to impress me. The sound quality is exceptional, with clear and rich audio that enhances my listening experience. The noise cancellation is top-tier, effectively blocking out distractions, and the slim, sleek design makes them comfortable for everything from biking and running to staying focused on work. Highly recommend these earbuds for anyone seeking great audio quality and comfort!', 'The earbuds come with three size pieces to keep them in your ears, amazing sound and noise cancellation! I have always been an Apple product girl, these earbuds blow my airpods out of the water! The quality of a Bose product is unmatched! I love the option to have quiet, aware, immersion. The App is easy and cool to use! You cannot top these earbuds they are the best on the market!', ""I bought a pair of Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds as an upgrade to the QuietComfoet Earbuds I bought in 2022. Once I put them in, I was very happily surprised at the performance, stability and features these neq earbuds had compared to the 2022 model. Instead of the stability wings, they replaced them with stability bands. I was happy to experience the new fit of these bands when I inserted them in my ears. The stability bands held firm and snug in my ear much different than the wings of the older model, and I hope Bose continues with this design for more earbuds to come. The sound that was produced was very rich yet crisp and not grainy, hissy nor poppy. They still have the same noise cancellation features and presets, but now there's a new sound mode called Immersion Audio that offers spatial audio effects while still or in motion, and the effect sounds awesome! I highly recommend these earbuds if you're looking for a quality sound experience while relaxing at home or on the go at work or at the gym."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] All the Bose products I have is wonderful and the new QC Ultra is well functioning NC I ever own. So comfortable and long battery time and sound is so much better than any other earbuds cost more than Bose. This earbuds are priceless compare to Apple, Samsung or other major brands.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Thesr are the best headphones ive had, really good quality, really good features fit perfect in the ear, u have to change the rubbers to your ear size but once you learn how to use them properly 100/100', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using Bose products for the past 30 years surround systems, speakers, headphones, earphones, etc you name it and i will choose Bose over any other brand because I know they are the BEST!!', ""ZERO COMPLAINTS FROM THIS CUSTOMER!!!!!! I'M SURE BOSE WILL BUT I FIND MYSELF WONDERING HOW THEY COULD EVEN BE IMPROVED!!!! Price was steep for my pay rate but nowadays what isn't!"", 'I have years experience with varying styles of headphones and earbuds but these by far have landed favorably to my everyday needs. I have used them in the gym, doing yard work while using power equipment, while working in the garage either doing woodcraft work or repairs, while playing my favorite musical instruments (drums and piano), and during general chores around the house. The noise dampening effect has replaced the need for hearing protection in loud environments. They are extremely comfortable and at times so comfortable that I have forgotten they were there. I own the previous version of Bose QC earbuds, the difference between the two is although the QC earbuds are also comfortable and have similar features these fit so much more securely.  The one area that have not experienced up to this point is the ability to connect to multiple mobile devices at the same time. I have had success with my QC earbuds in performing that function.  Pros:  Style Sleek design Comfort Noise damping  Functionality  Sound quality Battery life  Sweat proof Storage case Cons: Inability to connect to multiple mobile devices simultaneously']"
Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight,$649.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/apple-airpods-max-usb-c-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-midnight/18470961/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The AirPods max's are the best headphones ever, the best of all best buy gives us a discount for the best electronics my dad and i have been a member for a very long time and this is the best electronics store ever."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] AirPods Max are the best headphones I’ve ever tried. The quality is top-notch! Apple, as always, delivers premium products. Some people say they’re heavy, but that’s not true. I run and work out in them without any discomfort. The most impressive feature is the active noise cancellation. It’s a lifesaver on flights — you can’t hear the engine noise or crying kids. I highly recommend these to anyone who values comfort, style, and exceptional sound quality.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love my new AirPods Max! Love the color, they fit very comfortably and the sound is amazing! They come with their own protective case too.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing, highly recommend, high quality of sound and voice as well', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very Good quality and sound a very good option if you looking for some worth headphones won’t regret it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] AirPods max It’s best headphones Why You don’t buy This AirPods max', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The AirPods Max with USB-C offer excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and a luxurious design that makes them comfortable for long listening sessions. However, while they are undeniably a premium product, the difference in quality compared to the AirPods Pro doesn’t feel significant enough to justify their price being double. While I enjoy using them, the value for money might not be compelling for those already satisfied with Apple’s other headphone options.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m an apple girlie and was waiting for the 2nd gen to drop, thinking there was going to be upgrades. Wish I had gotten them sooner. The sound is awesome! Not heavy as people made them seem while wearing. I love them! I put them on also while cleaning and I’m more productive lol.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I feel like I’m in a music video when I have these on my head. You definitely can’t hear anyone when you have the noise cancellation turned on so if you want to ignore people these are for you', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My ears start to hurt since they have a little heft but I really like the look and sound quality on them']"
Samsung Galaxy Buds3 In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Silver,$149.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/samsung-galaxy-buds3-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-silver/17984586/review,"[""I am a HUGE fan of the Galaxy Buds Live, the open ear bean buds. They're so comfortable I've walked into the shower multiple times with them on and just not realizing it. So I was hoping that the Galaxy Buds 3 would be an adequate replacement with better sound and mic quality and they come so so close. They're just as comfortable as the Buds Live, if not more so, and they sound *way* better, but they do sit in your ear more and block more outside sound, and most gallingly, unlike the Buds Pro, they have no transparency / ambient mode!?! Literally just add transparency mode and they would be the perfect buds live replacements, but without it they're just another pair of earbuds."", ""I don't recommend it. It looks very cool and feel cheap. Buds keep falling out of my ears instantly and I don't even feel it. Easy to get damaged or scratches. Don't think it can even come close to water too"", ""Having used the Galaxy Buds 2 for over two years it felt like a no-brainer to upgrade to the latest version. The sound quality is definitely the best I've heard in any earbuds and the swipe/pinch media controls are far better than the annoying touch controls of the Buds 2, but for some reason Samsung decided to get rid of the silicone eartips. Because of this, the headphones simply don't stay in place even when I'm sitting perfectly still, and I have to constantly adjust it to keep them in my ears. They're way too bulky and uncomfortable. The Buds 3 Pro apparently do have silicone tips but they're around $400 after taxes which is really disappointing coming from someone who usually prefers Samsung's products."", 'I bought it a month ago, so far very happy with the performance. A good competition to other brand', 'I bought 6 months ago and having too much problem with sound effects.', 'The earbuds stay in place in my ears even when I move around often or run. You do not have the issue of pausing media by mistakenly touching them. You have to press the earbuds for most commands. A very responsive voice command allows you to pause, skip, rewind, etc. So you can also control them without touching the buds. When I make calls as well, the audio quality is quite clear. The left and right earbuds allow you to select different actions when you push them e.g. start an app. They also sit comfortably when I put them on. I did not expect that I would enjoy the earbuds this much due to reviews I saw online, however, it has been a delight using them.', ""I only got these headphones because it was included in a Black Friday deal on a phone, otherwise I wouldn't have. In retrospect, I wish I'd gone with a different deal because these are awful. They don't fit well, they constantly feel loose or fall out of my ear entirely. I find them incredibly uncomfortable. Even when I use the noise cancellation feature, if I'm somewhere loud, such as walking in traffic, I can barely hear my music. I can't figure out the touch controls, they're not intuitive and I don't even bother most of the time. These are really awful and I do not recommend them for anyone."", ""I'm very pleased with these earbuds. I needed something to replaced the wired set I was using and this is the perfect option. Fit and function are very good. Can keep them in all day without ear pain. Call quality and music both sound great too. I opted for these over the Pro because I don't find rubber tips to be comfortable for extended use."", 'These Buds 3 are very good quality got them from Best Buy and also came with a free clip case. The only issues with these is that it only supports Samsung phone! I have an iPhone and no use if you have an iPhone cause only what you can do is just connecting with Bluetooth and listening. None of the features you can use with the Buds 3 if you have an iPhone. There was a Galaxy Buds app on iOS and I downloaded and it was updated 3 years ago! It only had old earbuds on the list. I’m going to return these back. But if you are an Samsung user it’s very good and loud and all features work.', ""I purchased these after reading the good reviews for their audio quality. I put them in my ear, and they fell out with minimal movement after only a minute. I could use them as long as I sat still, and the sound was pretty good when they did work. Again, I cannot walk or talk with them, or I'll lose one or both. I did cleaned the tips and my ears, which helped for two minutes before the same problem arose. If you are used to AirPods with the same design, these might work for you; otherwise, I suggest pumping out the extra hundred for the Pros with the rubber tips.""]"
JBL Tune 520BT On-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - Purple,$49.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-tune-520bt-on-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-purple/17857923/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Another great product from JBL. JBL Tune 520BT Headphones are very well designed and simple to use. Very well packaged as well as graphics on box. The moment I unboxed I realized these were solidly built and designed which I am accustomed to from JBL. Packaging was on point with a quick and easy setup manual. Headphones were charged and ready go right out of the box. Easy to setup and connect to blue tooth. The Tune 520BT sound was very good from a basic easy to use headphones. They seemed to block out surrounding noise. I would like to try on a flight and see how they perform. I definitely believe if your looking for well priced and easy to use headphones with good build and sound quality these are a no brainer. The only negative is I wish they came with a better storage bag or case for protection when not in use or putting them in a book bag. These would be great for kids and teens. I definitely will use as my go to headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound on these headphones are absolutely amazing! Such great quality! The amount of time the battery last for is great too! Charging doesn't take too long and is easy to do. Connecting to Bluetooth is simple. The only thing I could see as a downfall is some people may not like the size of the ear pieces. They are on the smaller size."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones for music high on bass the app is a plus you have control over your settings at any time this is a very cool tool Seems like is a noise canceling headphones because I can’t hear outside noise even on low volume', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used these headphones for a few days now and for the price, I am very impressed. Decent padding on the top and ears. I can wear them comfortably for hours. The blue tooth range is good because I move from rooms to rooms without disconnection (upstairs) If I go down stairs, I lost connection. The sound is better than I expected for the price. Lyrics are clear and base is deep. The ability to connect the JBL Tune 520 BT to multiple devices simultaneously, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, makes my lives a lot easier because I connect them with my work computer and my phone. The only complaint I have is the charging cable is a bit too short.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using this JBL Tune 520 BT headphones for about 10 days. So far the best for the price in terms of build quality, sound quality, features and options it has. The box is included with the cable for charging. The best part is it has a JBL app supporting these headphones using which we can customize some of the settings and the setup is very easy. Coming to wearing it for a longer time is also good without any complaints with its long-lasting battery and feather kind of light weight. Coming to sound quality and bass is great for the price. It has the option of a multipoint connection, like connecting to 2 devices at a time and switching between them, but I found it a little hard to switch and there was no clear info about it. Other than that, the rest of the things are absolutely great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around experience. I enjoy using these headphones while in the office or chores around the house. They block out just enough sound without making me feel like I am missing anything going on around me. Very easy to connect to my phone and computer. The sound quality has been perfect for both music and podcasts. They are a good weight to where I do not feel bogged down while wearing. I look forward to using these when I need a little me time in the office.', ""The JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones are the best headphones I've had so far, the sound quality is sensational and they soundproof perfectly. They have a built-in microphone and volume control in the earpiece, which is very convenient to use. These are wireless earphones that connect via Bluetooth, and additionally work with the Google Assistant, so you can control them with your phone using voice commands. They last over 50 hours on a single charge and can be connected to a phone and a laptop at the same time. They are very comfortable to use - they have soft inserts and a headband with a large range of adjustment, and the headphones are foldable, thanks to which they can be easily packed into a purse or backpack. I use headphones every day to listen to music, give tutoring or talk on the phone and in each of these options they work great. Sometimes even children use them when they want to listen to their favorite children's songs and they are also delighted. I highly recommend :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tune 520 are over-ear headphones, made of plastic with faux-leather earcups. Like I said they’re very lightweight and the earcup padding is plush, but the clamping force is pretty high so those with larger heads (like me) will be uncomfortable after even a moderate listening session. Those with normal-sized heads might feel differently. Overall, the construction seems pretty good. The controls on the 520 are straightforward and similar to other JBL units. There are buttons on the right ear cup to help you turn the phones on and off, adjust volume, skip tracks forward and backwards, play/pause audio. The power button is also used for Bluetooth, and the upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 is a nice addition. The headphones support multi-point connection, which means that they can connect to two devices. Charging is handled by USB-C. You can also adjust the equalization using the JBL Headphones app. The 520s delivered very balanced sound out of the box. It was extremely flat, but connecting to the app allows you to tailor them to your liking. Stereo separation is great and the bass extension in the app provides a ton of punch. It took me a little while, but I was able to get the equalizer set to my liking. Bottom line: The JBL Tune 520 are a nice way to break into JBL headphones. They’re super lightweight, the battery life is tremendous, and if you like bass you’ll love these headphones. The ability to tailor the sound using JBL’s app (which I really like) is a big plus for headphones in this price range. You just better have a smaller head.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable, crisp, light weight and sleek. I like how they aren't bulky, I don't feel like they are wearing me..simple buttons with function. They are very comfortable on my ears for hours. They definitely have good bass sound for my daily tracks I wouldn't recommend for a bass enthusiast but they do enhance the bass in my tracks to make it sound crisp."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Starting off, the packaging is perfectly done with a good presentation. It’s strait to the point while keeping wasteful extras to a minimum. The build quality, this is something that is super important with headphones intended to be used every day. After vigorously testing and using these over a week, there is no apparent weakness and these are very well made while maintaining a super light weight. The adjustments above the ear cups are the only gripe found with these but once set in a comfortable spot they seem to stay there. Now, the most important part, the sound quality. As expected from JBL, the sound signature is near perfect strait out of the box. There is adjustable EQ capabilities on the app which brings the headphones to a new level. Punchy lows and crispy highs, these keep your tunes fresh for hours on end. The extremely respectable battery life on these outshine any others. I forgot to even charge these for the majority of the time using them so far. To finalize this, I can say without a doubt, these are a smart purchase for any average listener or school goers who need an extra upgrade in sound. I wouldn’t recommend these for any heavy movement activities but they do stay in place pretty well.']"

I use them for music and watching study lectures. I can use them for like phone calls or zoom calls but sometimes people say it can be hard to hear me but they will work for calls. I even sometimes just turn them on for the noise cancellation feature and don’t play anything. The sound quality is really nice especially in noise canceling mode. I’ve noticed if I have them out of noise canceling mode but a loud noise goes off near me or I yell it kicks noise canceling on which is cool. They fit nice on my head and don’t really hurt after extended use. The battery last a really long time I’ve only had to charge them maybe twice. I like the white color and it isn’t hard to keep clean. They came with a nice case so they are easy to carry around places. They also connect to 2 devices at once so I can easily be watching a video on my computer and pick up my phone and the audio switches to that.

The clear and crisp bass adds to the overall enjoyment, while the foldable design makes storage convenient. The protective case is both soft and firm, ensuring the headphones are well-protected. I highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a superior audio experience and would choose them over the XM5 without hesitation. I would say that they are a step up from the extra bass 910s that they replaced.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve got ten headphones (two are buds) that said for $129 on sale these are fair value. Super light. Busy app. Hesvy bass. Muddy sound that EQ helps but not enough crisp highs for me. Comfortable. Nice case. Shortest charge cord ever. Could’ve paid another $70 for the xm4. I prefer my crusher evos and bose QC. About the same overall as beats studio pro but less comfy with more bass and less clarity. They also look bulky on head. Won’t return but would not buy a second pair.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought in July of 2024, they are amazing headphones! I use at the gym, school, and even during my free time. At the gym, they are stable & don’t fall while doing exercises that make me look down. Noise cancellation is great but could be better! Battery life is also amazing even after 9 months, i only need to charge once every 2 months if needed. overall 4.5/5!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good Sounding headphones, with pretty good battery life so far, Not the most comfortable headband but does the job. Definitely delivers on the bass even without the ULT modes, and goes VERY bassy if you want that, the quality is still good just overwhelming bass.', 'Bought these headphones and everything was going okay until the sound started to fade out and in every time it gets loud or quiet.

I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal, so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The Bose stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing, and the fit is very comfortable for long periods of wear, they are very comfortable. These do not have noise-canceling but excellent sound quality. If you're getting them so you can hear the environment's true outside sounds due to the open design, they are perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear, but don't get dismayed no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you use your earbuds, you won't be disappointed, these are perfect. I have used a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software, and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Bose headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before, like tap touch control. This feature comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. The Charging case snaps closed, and the ear buds snap into the case through magnets and clips, and they are super secure in my opinion, just in case you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time, and I was not able to completely drain them in a single listen. The Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones. All in all, these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper, or they go on sale, it's a no-brainer."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the Bose ultra earbuds about three weeks ago and overall, I’m very happy with them. They’re extremely comfortable, and very easy to put on and take off. The connection between the front and back of the earbuds is made of an elastic material so they are never too tight. The quality of the sound is excellent. The highs come through nicely, which usually isn’t a problem for this type of earbud, but what stands out is that the base is nice and full. The only criticism I have is that I wish they were a bit louder. I frequently find myself listening to them at maximum volume. That is the only reason I gave him four stars instead of five. But I have no issue recommending them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are of exceptional quality. They are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, allowing me to stay connected with my family and friends effortlessly. I can enjoy podcasts, music, or my favorite documentaries without interruption. Additionally, I no longer experience ear infections, thanks to these earbuds. The battery life is impressive and lasts a long time. The immersive audio is super cool!', 'I bought my earbuds a little under a month ago and I absolutely LOVE them!

Bose QuietComfort Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Triple Black,$329.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-triple-black/17212847/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After spending some time with these headphones, I can confidently say they are my absolute favorite. They are very comfortable for long-term use. They fit completely over my ears, so I experience zero fatigue. The ear pads and the headrest pad are insanely soft. These are perfect for long sessions at your desk or listening to music on the go. I work so much at my desk with work, school, and then video games; these are a perfect all-around fit. The all-day battery actually lasts all day long. I've noticed they also hold a charge really well. I left them at 70%, and two days later, when I turned them back on, they were still at 70%. They connected seamlessly to my iPhone. If you have the battery level widget on, these will display their battery level along with your other connected devices, which I love. Of course, they will work with Android as well. I recommend downloading the Bose Music app to have the best possible experience with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top tier. They do a great job of blocking out any unwanted noise. The carrying case they come with is great quality, and it comes with a little pouch where you can store the charger and the included 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm audio cable. There's also a small tag in the case that guides you on how to fold your headphones so that they fit in the case perfectly. I love these headphones! They're my new daily driver."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve been listening to music, podcasts, and watching movies with these Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over The Ear Headphones for the past week and I am smitten with them. They have become my go to / primary dedicated headphones for listening. They are very comfortable for extended listening sessions. I\'ve fallen asleep with them on, I am a side sleeper and they don\'t bother my ears. I don\'t fall asleep with headphones on often lol, but the couple times I have.. they did not bother my ears or sleep. Once I woke up with them on the floor, so I guess I knocked them off my head and they did not take any damage. Build quality is excellent, I wouldn\'t snooze with them everyday or just toss them in a bag without the case though. The headband is quite strong and sturdy. I gave it the old twist / flex test and it doesn\'t creak at all or feel like it will break. The headband is actually a little flexible. I own quite a few sets of headphones and earbuds ( I won\'t mention brand names) But These Bose Quiet Comfort are quite possibly the best sounding headsets I\'ve ever owned. My music library touches just about every genre, and it all sounds amazing with these headphones. I like to use the bass booster setting in the Bose app because I like to feel the bass a little, but I leave mids and treble at 0 and every note is loud and crispy clear. The bass does not completely overpower everything else but you can still feel the bass thumping on your temple a little.I think Bose has re-established themselves as the best in sound quality with these. I smile every time I hear a little note or sound I missed / didn\'t notice before with other headphones before. You definitely will not be disappointed with them. Battery life is excellent but they do take a lil while to charge. So I would recommend topping them off when they get between 20-40% if you plan on being away from a plug for a while. The right ear cup has volume controls, charging port and the power slider. The left ear cup has an AUX port and a button to toggle between ""quiet and aware"" modes. Would I recommend these headphones? For sure! I love them and would gladly buy another pair if I need to replace them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first Bose headphones, but I’ve used plenty of headsets that boasted many features including multi device and noise cancelling. But I have to say that Bose has mastered the science of the noise cancelling headset, creating the QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones. This is one of the best headsets I have ever used, even for just blocking out background noise to find a little peace and quiet. Pros - Easy setup and use. - Amazing noise cancellation. - Perfect for on the go. Cons - Fit takes time to get used to. - EQ settings are rather basic. Out of the box, which includes a travel case, USB C, and audio cable with inline Mic, the initial setup is extremely simple. Literally, Bose has made it so you can use the QuiteComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear headphones without needing the app out of the box. But the app does enable added features that make the experience better when used together with the headset. I was able to pair the QuiteComfort right out of the box without any issue. Within minutes I was on a call through my phone without any issues. All you must do is put the Bose QuiteComfort on, push and hold the power button past the on position until you hear the “pairing mode” cue, then select the Bose Headset from the list of available devices on your specific device. And Done. No downloads or annoying app setup is required. One of the best setup experiences I have ever had with a headset. I was able to easily pair the QuiteComfort with my work laptop, tablet, and even desktop computer without any additional downloads or issues. The multi-device connection allows for 2 devices to be connected at the same time, which is super convenient if you want to take a call while being connected into another device. The buttons to control the headset are well placed on the headset but the multi-function button on the Right earcup will take a bit getting used to as there are multiple commands on one button: 1 press is Play or Pause or Answer or End a phone call, 2 presses is Skip Forward, 3 presses is Skip Backward, and a Press and Hold will decline a call. While the left button can be customized to open a selected app or perform a set task with a single press or act as a Mute button if pressed 2 times while on a call. Overall, the buttons feel responsive and easy to find while wearing the headset. The build quality is great, high-quality plastic is used but it feels solid and doesn’t give or flex during use. Both ear cups can rotate and extend down to be adjusted to fit better on the head. A USB-C plug is available on the bottom of the Right earcup for power and a 3.5mm audio jack is available on the bottom of the Left earcup for use with an audio cable. The sound is crisp and clean, no matter which device I connected to the sound came in clear. The call quality was amazing! I had multiple comments on how clear my voice was heard even with background noise going on, I lucked out and got these the same week my neighbor had their main sewer line replaced. I was able to confirm that both the mic and audio noise cancelling work quite well, even being just across the street the background noise never broke through the call to be louder than the voice or audio. That’s not to say they couldn’t hear the background noise, but my voice was still very clear and understandable. If you need a headset to use in a loud environment, that will keep your audio and voice clear, the Bose QuietComfort is a great choice. The Noise cancellation had more settings than most, allowing for a sliding selection of sensitivity for the filtering of background noise. There are different modes that can be cycled through using the Left action button, by default there are 2 modes: Quiet and Aware. The “Aware” mode is helpful if you want to reduce the overall noise and look like you are listening to music but be fully aware of your surroundings. This brings me to my only initial complaint about the headset, which was that initially the headphones gave me a bit of a squeezed or suctioned feeling when I put them on. This is due to the passive noise cancelling of the earphone cushions, which create a tight seal with the head to keep out extra noise. This was something I had to get used to before I could enjoy the headphones to their fullest. If you have any sensitivity to your ears or inner ears, these headphones may take time for you to adjust. The added EQ settings really do make a difference but are limited to just a few “adjustments” but should cover most user’s needs, though if you’re used to a ton of pre-settings, there are only 4: Bass Boost, Bas Reducer, Treble Boost, and Treble Reducer. It’s basic, but for my uses it works as I’ll adjust most of my audio on the source side. Overall, I’d suggest the Bose QuietComfort headphones to anyone looking for a premium audio experience that needs noise canceling and multi-device connectivity. The Bose QuietComfort will reduce or cancel out a moderately noisy background like the office or public transportation while providing great sound and audio performance. The noise cancelling on the mic is quite amazing, keeping the voice quality clear even in extremely noisy environments. Though these are premium headphones, they are a perfect example of the saying, “You get what you pay for”. The Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones are a great product for anyone on the go who wants a great experience from their headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bose has always been known to make high-quality products that sound great, so I was extremely excited to try out the new QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling headphones. While I have been impressed with the build quality, nice sound, and high tech features, there are just a few things that keep these from being a “perfect” set of headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones ship in a sleek box, and included along with the headphones are a hard-sided carrying case, a USB-C charging cable, a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable with an inline microphone, as well as warranty information. Inside the package is a QR code that will send you to the Bose Music app that is used to control the settings on the headphones. Downloading was simple, and my headphones were paired in a matter of seconds after I had finished charging them up. The Bose Music app really comes in handy when using the QuietComfort headphones, as it allows for customization options that aren't accessible by any other means. I appreciated that you can easily switch from “Aware” mode, which pumps in the ambient sound around you, and “Quiet” mode, which is noise cancelling. You can also create a custom mode that blends the two, with a slider used to dial in how much noise cancelling you want (or none at all). Unfortunately, there is no option to just use the headphones in Bluetooth mode with neither Aware or Quiet turned off; one or the other (or a combo) must always be activated. I found that the sound while in Aware mode was actually not that intrusive when it came to amplifying the sounds happening in the outside world around me. Basically, it did not sound overly harsh or synthetic that I was being fed in the ambient noise by the headphones mic system. Noise cancelling is also very good on these headphones, probably the best I’ve ever heard. While the QuietComfort headphones use fancy technology to achieve these results, it helps that the headset cancels out a fair amount of noise just by putting them over your ears. With the noise cancelling off, I noticed that I already had a hard time hearing the people around me; once the noise cancelling is turned on, it’s very much as if you’re in your own private world. I haven’t had a chance to use these on an airplane, but I’d imagine they would be excellent at negating some of the annoying noises found on most flights. Now here’s where we get to my first problem with the Bose QuietComfort headphones. The seal around your ears that is responsible for that awesome reduction in ambient noise, is also something that I’ve found I can only tolerate for small amounts of time. The sense of pressure on my ears is so noticeable, that it reminds me of in-ear earbuds and why I have a very hard time wearing those types of headphones. I thought that maybe it was only when the Quiet mode was on, but this sensation was persistent throughout my testing, and occurred even when the headphones were turned off and being used with a cable. The first day I had these, I wore them for about a total of 5 hours, and tried to ignore the feeling in my ears. Over the course of that night and the next day, I had a headache and my ears felt like I had been listening to music at full blast. I recognize that this is something that affects everyone differently, and that some people likely won’t notice this at all. However, I thought I should mention it, in case someone (like me) is very sensitive to headphones that create a strong seal on their ears. The upside is that aside from that sensation (for me), these are some of the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever worn. The headband is soft and padded, and the super squishy earpads are large and completely go around your ears. The inside of the cups is also deep enough that I never noticed my ears touching the drivers or the sides of the cup. Each side is adjustable using sliders that extend plenty far enough for my big head, with room to spare. On to the sound. (For testing, I used an iPhone 13, a MacBook Pro, and an Xbox controller with a 3.5 mm headphone jack). The sound profile of these headphones is very different when in Bluetooth, versus playing with the included cable. On a Bluetooth connection, the sound slightly emphasizes the bass, and the mids and treble sound defined, and thankfully the highs are also not too harsh. What is strange, is that if you push the volume past about 70 percent, the bass starts to artificially roll off as you approach 100 percent. I imagine that this is done to lessen the chances of blowing out the speakers (?), but what's interesting is that when played with the audio cable (no Bluetooth), you can push the volume to the max and easily tell that these headphones can handle it, no problem. While I don't listen to things at full blast all the time, I like knowing that I can raise the volume, and every facet of the sound will follow along. The artificial bass cutoff with Bluetooth turned on is so noticeable, and I honestly have no idea why they implemented it. Additionally, the QuietComfort headphones get LOUD in Bluetooth mode, but once again, with the dimmed-down bass at the top of the volume range, I saw no reason to push it to 100 percent. Audio quality with the included cable is like a totally different headphone. When playing music with the cable, the QuietComforts sound incredibly neutral, with bass that borders on anemic at times. Thankfully, the actual tone of the sound range is great, with tons of detail in the mids and highs, with genres like rock, country, and classical sounding pretty amazing with the power off. I do wish that the bass was more pronounced, but it can show itself in some more bass-heavy tracks found in hip-hop and electronic music. Overall, the audio cable sound was impressive, even if I wish there was just a touch more bass. As for the cable, this is definitely a weak point of the Bose QuietComfort headphones. While it has a mic (that works fine for phone calls), it is incredibly thin and flimsy feeling. Additionally, I didn’t measure it but it barely made the length from my headphones to my side pants pocket where my phone was. It also does not have any inline controls, so you cannot change the volume, answer calls, press play/skip, etc. This feels like the absolute bare minimum Bose could have included with these headphones, and almost urges you to use them in Bluetooth mode. Other things I didn't cover: -There are buttons on the headphones, for volume and controlling tracks/answering phone calls. These can’t be used when running the headphones via the cable (I tried). -There is another button used to switch between modes, or tell you the battery life (via a voice in the headset). -Battery life is rated at about 24 hours per charge, and I believe it. I haven’t timed exactly how long I’ve been using these in Bluetooth, but the charge lasts a very long time. -Cable charging is done with USB-C, so that is a plus! Although the included cable is so short I’m not sure how useful it is. -The Bose Music app lets you adjust the EQ of the headphones, which is nice, though I’m not much on using EQs on my phone to begin with. -Build quality is great, these headphones feel sturdy enough to hold up for the long haul, and all of the materials used feel great in the hand. Overall, I believe that Bose has created a great set of noise-cancelling headphones, with only a few downsides. I do think Bose could make improvements when it comes to being able to use Bluetooth without Quiet or Aware mode; no artificial bass cutoff in Bluetooth mode; and a better audio cable. If you’re looking for exceptional noise cancelling with good sound quality, and don’t mind the few issues I noted, the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones should definitely be on the top of your list!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these for my birthday and I really enjoy them. The sound quality is great, I love the different modes, and the immersion is amazing. The only downside is that it doesn't take much volume for the audio to leak a bit."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose QC Noise Cancelling headphones! TLDR - Lightweight and super comfy headphones! Out of the box, you get the headphones, headphones case, a charging cable (USB Type A to C), and a 3.5mm audio cable. Pros: > Build quality feels good and premium. The headphones are super comfy and I can wear them for hours without having any ear fatigue/pain. The ear pads are pretty plushy and create quite a tight seal for very good noise cancelling. The headband is flexible with a good amount of tension (as to not move/shift), so these headphones should fit comfortably for many different people. These headphones hardly moved/shifted when I was working out. The buttons are very tactile and give good feedback to confirm presses (unlike some of my other headphones which have buttons that are very mushy providing little tactile feedback). > Pairing is pretty straightforward and super simple. Sliding the bump toggle halfway turns on the headphones and sliding it all the way to the right puts the headphones into pairing mode. I appreciate this method more than the push/depress & hold methods which are found on many other headphones (e.g., Sony XM5s). I’m able to switch pretty easily & quickly from my phone, iPad, Macbook Pro, and other devices. > Audio quality is quite nice and I would say it’s pretty much on par with my Sony XM5 and this goes for the microphone quality as well! When connected to my gaming desktop or laptop, I noticed there isn’t much lag at all when playing games so that’s a big plus (especially crucial for FPS games). > Battery life is pretty good. I usually have the volume @ 70% and was able to go easily go two days with these (8+ hours each day) before needing to charge. Your mileage may vary but overall, it should last easily a full day with constant usage, which is more than enough for most users :) Cons: > None yet so far. I have been using these for the past week and they have been stellar. Though the Bose QuietComfort WIreless Noise Cancelling headphones come with a high price tag, they are totally worth it. I would highly recommend these to anyone that is looking for wireless over the ear headphones!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had the first generation of this headphone and brought it with me everywhere I went in the Marine Corps. After many years the only issue it could have was the bluetooth connection from across the house or gym. Now if that's the only issues than it did good. The Noise reduction system is kinda the same from the oldest model but the quality of speakers and hardware hasnt changed. So good that I gave my lil sister my old pair of QCs and picked up a new pair for music production. If only it had the Easy music mute like the Sony's newest noise cancellation headphones, but when I tried on every headphone at bestbuy. It was a hard decision at all, besides which color."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I rarely write product reviews for my purchases. However, on occasion, I will come across a product that warrants a review, whether it is positive or negative. With that being said, I am pleased to say this is one of my most positive reviews for a product, ever. I have struggled to find well-equipped, high-quality, ACTUAL noise-cancelling, over-the-ear headphones for so long due to my indecisive nature and lack of knowledge on what brand/type/cost is best for me. I usually struggle to the point of just giving up on choosing the best ones, I end up sticking with my ancient, slowly dying AirPods at the end of the day. That is not the case for this situation. I was so exhausted of using AirPods that don’t work half of the time and truthfully, the battery life was becoming non-existent without being on its charger. So, when I saw these Bose headphones went on sale at BestBuy, I sprung into action. I’ve used them consistently each day for about 2 months now. Switching over to these headphones has been an absolute game changer for me and my hectic daily schedule, as I am graduating veterinary school this May. The noise-cancelling power is wild! For example, a person could literally be screaming loudly behind me, and I would not hear even a peep, especially when I put them at the highest noise-cancelling setting. One of my favorite parts about these headphones is the ability to drown out any noise around me so I can focus on my paperwork, read, and study study study. I have always had an inability to stay on task since I was a child, and this annoying quirk resonates as trouble focusing and quieting my thoughts on to one solitary task/project at a time. These headphones have kicked my lack of attentiveness to the curb, and I now feel like I could get anything done with these magic little guys on my ears. The cool feature of these is the various noise modes that you can set them at depending on your needs or preferences in different settings. The modes include quiet (best noise-cancelling effect mode), aware (less noise-cancelling for better awareness of surroundings), music, home, relax, focus, commute (e.g., bus, train, airplane), workout, running, walking, working, and lastly, outdoor mode. You can easily switch between four different modes consecutively just by pushing the button that is conveniently on the backside of the left cuff. The left-sided button can be pressed and held down to readily access your shortcuts, such as Spotify or current battery level. It can also be used to mute a phone call, if needed, by pressing the respective left cuff button twice. There are three identical buttons on the outer portion of the right cuff that are used for: —> increasing/decreasing the volume —> pausing/playing the media (tap once on middle button) —> skipping to the next songs/episodes/etc. (tap twice on the middle button) —> tracking backwards to the previous song/episode/etc. (tap three times on the middle button) —> answering/declining phone calls Not to mention, these headphones hold a battery life like no freaking other. I have had them for two months and I have charged them fully ONCE? Like how does it do that? Nonetheless, I am obsessed with everything about my Bose headphones, starting with the aesthetically-pleasing minimalistic color, shape, weight, and comfortability they carry. Putting them on is like putting soft little sand-colored clouds on your ears. Feels like God himself could have crafted these bad boys when I wear them! Additionally, the headphones connect to a Bose app on your phone so you can adjust your listening preferences, bluetooth device connect-ability, and a multitude of other little intricacies that are extremely simple to navigate and change at any time you like. I am no Bose expert or product review specialist by any means, but I feel as though these deserve five stars for the impact they have made on my daily life! Bose products have become my Roman Empire. Thank you for listening and taking the time to read this. I hope my review will not cause you to have tunnel vision in what products are great vs others. Everyone has their own opinions, needs, and preferences, and I would hate for you to not love them as much as I love them. Overall, I hope that this review helps you decide what YOU want out of your next high-quality headphones purchase! Take care, and happy headphone hunting :)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these about a month ago as a gifts so far I really like them. The only complaint I have is that the noise cancellation is not as solid as I hoped but its still better than the headphones I used to use. They are super comfortable to wear though. I am a college student and I study for 4-6 hours aat a time I can wear them the entire time without being uncomfortable. Highly recommend. Super comfortable, cute, and easy to use! Wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4.0 stars.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had my headphones since the end of November I believe and the times I’ve used it have been maybe not over 6 times because I use my AirPods, and so usage has been very minimal and they haven’t even left my house once , yet, they look broken and flimsy, it does not have sound cancellation and I can hear noise after I wear them, when I place a call and I have the tv on, I have to turn it off because people can’t hear me, I’ve had beats by DRE but I would not recommend these, at all.. I’m not expert but this is solely out of experience and people deserve to know from experience, I will be returning.']"

I was having some connection difficulties with my Apple TV at first, so I googled the issue and found a solution on Reddit that fixed it. I work from home 90% of the time, and I wear the headphones basically all day, whether I’m at home or in the office, so they get plenty of use. I got clear covers for the ear pads and the headband off of Amazon along with covers for the ear cups (off Amazon too) for some protection. I got AppleCare, but I’m hoping I never have to use it. I haven’t had the purple ones long enough to comment on longevity, and I’ve heard the horror stories where they break/brick… I guess I’m just willing to take that risk.

The battery retains its charge for an extended period of time, allowing you to use your device without worrying about running out of power too quickly."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sent by influenster to test and review. I must say I’ve really enjoyed testing these ear buds. The sound quality is great I would say as good as my beats studios. I was surprised how good the mic was with how far they are from my mouth but the caller could hear me very clearly. I would say the battery is long lasting as I’ve used the several times and not had to recharge them as of yet. For ear buds I found them very comfortable and they came with several sizes to try.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound is great with many features such as bass boost, equaliser and the functions to control the music/video through tapping the headphones.However for the price they are they do not scream “luxury” to me, they feel like a cheap plastic (especially the casing) and even with changing the bud size they can still get uncomfortable if you move when led down.Compared the sports version the true wireless headphones do not match sennheisers standards in my opinion.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They come in a cardboard box as can be seen on the pictures. When you open it the earbuds have their own plastic pocket size case. They’re really easy to set up once you find them on Bluetooth. Something I’ve not seen before is they come with various sizes of earbuds for different ear canal sizes. If you like earbuds that cancel out background noise these are certainly the ones you need they do it fantastically. The sound itself is also really good I’ve listened to podcasts and music with them and you can really block out the world whilst you kick back and relax! The best earbuds I’ve ever owned.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are fantastic headphones, they deliver a high end sound quality, have an excellent battery life and great build quality. The headphones include different size silicone ear adapters, the standard size fit me, while the smaller size fits my wife. I found the adapters easy to change and fit. The headphones stay in, even with heavy movement, are easy to put in and take out and are extremely comfortable even for long periods of time. The charging case is small and functional. The setup is simple with clear instructions, paring is straightforward and the gestures are easy to remember.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earphones are amazing, everything needed was in the box. Included was a number of spare tips, a charging case and cables. These were super easy to install, I installed the accompanying app and followed the instructions. The buds automatically updated themselves and i was ready to go. Sound quality is great, you can also adjust the equaliser to tune the sound. In the app you can also customize the button presses, I have never seen this before! The buds have noise cancelling and pass-thru. I was cleaning my car with a vacuum and turned on NC, the sound of the vacuum was almost completely removed. Battery life is great and the distance the buds connect is great. Over all I fully recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these! Usually I wear over ear headphones as in the past I've found earbuds uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. These are so much better. The changeable pieces for your ears allow you to find the most comfortable set. The sound quality is great, the bass notes nice and rumbly. It connects easily through Bluetooth, it isn't complicated. With the case also being a charger it can last for ages without needing to be plugged in too. I'd highly recommend these."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having used these for a couple of days now, I am really pleased with this Earbuds. I found that music streaming was surprisingly good quality. Very clear sound, bass is amazing, absolutely easy and comfortable to wear for prolonged periods, fit is nice and snug so no worries about them falling out whilst active. Magnetic and holds the charge well and really quick. When you put the earbuds back in the case/charger, they switch off and get charged up to full. long battery life too! Very easy to pair with a variety of different devices, controls are easy to navigate , overall a great performance , sturdy build for a high quality pair of headphones. The case/charger is beautifully designed, Small and practical, only about 6x5x2cm and fits in a pocket or handbag easily so can be taken everywhere and won't take up much space. Absolutely love this and 20 stars!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Can’t believe I never had a pair of earphones like this , the sound quality is amazing and the way they cut all noise out , didn’t know they was a app that you can download and add more bass and stuff like that they connected easy to may iPhone and really fit nice in the ear .']"

Easy to operate too. I don't understand the sound canceling part. I hear the sound of the wind very loud while making calls or listening to music when taking a walk on the road. The same windy sound is heard too when the car fan is turn for AC or heater. I would like to get explanation on why this happens."", ""I bought these earbuds a few weeks ago on sale for $45. They're worked well, the quality is good, the noise cancelling is solid, I've dropped them multiple times and they still work fine. My critiques are: scratches on the case are easy to see, and sometimes there is connectivity issues when I use them with my phone and then my laptop. The app also works well so I would recommend if you're looking for something in this price range."", ""Pros. I like them for 🎵 but no so much for podcasts. I tried different settings for the later. Noise cancellation is just ok. Cons. They could have easily put a small led in them to know if they are ON or not. I don't know they ever skipped that. Also once they are off, you have to put them back in the case and take out to power them ON. Lastly, there is no way to know case battery status. At least i couldn't find it in one week. But then the price justifies some cons."", ""If you're like me, you might find yourself dealing with a set of airpods that no longer function in any great way. And I don't want to spend another $170+ on another set that will slowly die over the next 2-3 years. I went looking for an alternative, and found these. I have a few other Anker products, including small bluetooth speakers, and they work well. I decided to try these earbuds because they also promise to be noise cancelling. I've had them a few days, and they're great so far. Unlike airpods, I don't have to recharge them after about 3-4 hours, and their connectivity is more seamless than other 3rd party bluetooth earbuds I've used. I appreciate the little phone holder in the charging case, and that these come in a colour other than white. Even if you're buying them to pair with other Apple products, the pair fine. They don't have all the features that Apple airpods do, but also don't have the same annoying issues, either. Also big thanks to Best Buy. I got these delivered in less than 24 hours, which was crazy good. I can't say how long these little fellas will ultimately last for, but if they go another 3-4 years then I'll be happy, especially for the price."", 'have been using these for a few weeks. Overall great sound quality for the price paid. would buy again', ""I've found recently that I've been going through many earbuds. I've usually been a Skull Candy guy myself, but I just lost another set. I was thinking about picking up a pair of high-end Sony's because I've heard really good reviews about them. The sound quality, the use of them as well as other things. So on my way to Best Buy, one of my Apple earbuds just died on me. So I was looking around at a few different types of Bud's and the associate introduced me to the Soundcore. And I was surprised at the sound quality given their price. Nice clear sound,long lasting battery and they are pretty easy to use. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the noise from outside. The outside sound cancelling really isn't the best unless you're going for a walk down a quiet street. Other than that, for what they cost you really can't complain. I'd gladly recommend these to my friends."", 'I recently purchased the Anker P30i TWS Earpods from Best Buy Windsor, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase! These earbuds deliver exceptional sound quality with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for both music and calls, specially when paired with the app. The battery life is impressive, lasting more than 8 hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides additional charges, ensuring I never run out of power. The Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity is seamless and reliable, with no dropouts or delays. I also love how comfortable they are to wear—even during long listening sessions. The noise isolation feature works remarkably well, blocking out background noise and allowing me to focus. Best Buy Windsor provided excellent customer service, and the staff was very helpful in guiding me through my options. I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for affordable, high-quality wireless audio!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these as a ""cheap"" replacement to my old Samsung Galaxy Buds that cost twice as much as these do - and these are way better! Everything from the sound quality, microphone, the touch controls, noise canceling, and passive mode are SOOOO much better. I love the built-in phone stand as well, its quite practical! 5/5', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very impressed with these! The mic quality is better than my AirPods! I love that you can use the app to change the EQ and change the noise cancellation settings. They are very cute and portable. Also it doubles as a portable phone stand. Already a big fan!', 'The audio, battery, and noise cancelling is all really good for the price. The only reason I can’t give 5 stars is because the case gets scratched up very quickly from the softest things. Nothing that will make the earphones not work but something to consider.']"

I go through about a pair every 6 months or so (battery fails, they fall out and get stepped on, etc.). I was hesitant to try these, but I am glad that I did. The wrap-around design means that you can pull them down off of your ears, and they just stay put around your neck. The sound is good, and I have asked a few people about the phone call quality, and they have all said that it\'s fine. I was a little ""cautious"" about the Best Buy blue option, but it was on sale. It looks fine, and I don\'t have any problems with a garish color or anything.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the way these sound, and the ability to easily hear others when they talk to me without having to remove an earbud. It is almost as if there was music playing in the room and someone was speaking with you. This is hugely valuable when sharing a space with people. I also like the feeling of openness to the environment and ""presence"" when cycling or walking. I was a bit concerned about buying the steel blue model even though it was on sale, as the blue looked somewhat gaudy and childish/cheap in the photos. But it looks great in real life, more subtle and appropriate for a solid piece of equipment. Very pleased. It does sound a bit softer than other headphones I have, so I find myself setting the volume higher.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have gone through a ton of wireless earbuds and I'm not a huge fan of the tips being in my ears all the time!

Extremely happy with them and would recommend to everyone looking for open ear headphones."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have the OpenRun Pro and now the OpenRun Pro 2. Love both. The bass is deeper in the Pro 2 and the power plug uses a USB-C.

They are very comfortable and in a lot of cases, I forget I have them on. I wear them while on phone calls and Teams/Zoom meetings. I like them so much, I have purchased multiple pairs for gifts.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have the open pro run for 2 years.

It's straightforward, easy to navigate and trouble free."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Compared to the previous versions of Shokz bone conduction headphones, these are much improved. The sound is richer: better bass and much clearer highs. Older versions were very mid-heavy and muffled. Another improvement is the feel of the bone conduction. The feeling of your temples “vibrating” from bone conduction has reduced significantly, so it feels more like regular headphones. Very lightweight and easy to wear, this was worth the upgrade!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this device after spending some time with a sales rep discussing the fact that I only wanted a device if it was capable of reading text messages allowed to me when they arrive on my iPhone. The sales rep did some Google searches and reading within their data database and said that this unit had that capability. If it does, I have been unable to figure out how to make that work. I did submit a question to the question and answers section asking for clarification about this feature, but apparently my question has been rejected as it has not appeared in the listing of Q&A items nearly a week after my purchase. In addition to lacking this critical feature, I have found that the audio quality for calls is less than desirable, and rigid structure around the back of my neck interferes with collared shirts and jackets.

Due to the box being open i was not able to return them."", 'So, the first headset wouldn\'t power on. Charged it 24 hrs, press, hold, nothing. 2 seconds. 5. 10. Not a sound. It\'s the first DOA product I\'ve purchased in a very long time. It legitimately had me concerned for the overall quality if their QA isn\'t set up to catch a dead product. Bestbuy was quick to exchange (and offered a refund) - great customer service. I unboxed and charged up the replacement - after the same non-response out of the box. Thankfully after what felt like an eternity of press & hold to power did the polite voice give me the ""power on"" prompt. Now that I have the fully functional product: it\'s light, comfy, gives a lossless connection that wipes out the background noise handily, doesn’t surpise me in good or bad ways acoustically, and the case is good despite being a bit tight for the headset and included cables. Full price no way these are worth it, but a good enough deal and they\'re worth their (light) weight, barely so.', 'my heads not like abnormally small but these headphones are big on me. unfortunately. the sound quality seems to be pretty decent though. tbh i’m not too share because i have nothing to compare it too but the bass is alright', ""Got it yesterday. It feels like the original old Beats. looks good, feels good. so that's the reason why build is 4 stars if you know what old Beats feels like. The sound is relative good depends on what device you are using. It supports AAC and SBC. so if you use IPhone or IPAD, the default sound might be bit of different from the ones who use Android. I tested on both mobile systems. someone says bit of sound blurs, I wouldn't say it's not the truth. But it's all because the headphone is not tuned specifically for a platform when it's out of factory, but it also depends on the codec on your device as well. In this case, just download a equalizer software, 5 minutes work, get your favourite preference setup, the headphone would be awesome. I mean this one is pretty capable headphone which definitely worth more than $79 to me. plus, you get a leather case which is a good win as well. Since it needs to be tuned for my Andriod phone, I rate ease of use 3 stars. For IOS, it's actually better, no need to be tuned, especially for the music you bought from apple music store."", 'I had a pair of Monster Headphones prior to this monster headphones these ones sound fantastic I still getting used to them but I do love them.

JLab Epic Air Sport In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Black,$79.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jlab-epic-air-sport-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-black/16006936/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First time trying wireless ear buds. Never had much luck with any in-ear headphones, they always fall out. And so the appeal with these was the over the ear loop. I have a wired pair with them and they stay in pretty good but I rarely use them. The second appeal with these is being able to use them as a blue tooth to answer calls. They were kind of heave in my ears and the noise cancelling function was a bit strange sounding. I never got use to the various touch or hand motion commands where you can touch or tap these ear buds to skip ahead a track or change the noise cancelling function or change the volume. The main problem I have with these, beside the weight of them, is the over the ear loop is not adjustable and the angle of the in ear speaker is strange. There was a gap in the ear loop to my ear that was not rectifiable. No adjusting it. No way to make them hug my ear any better. I am including as many photos to show these angles as I can. The other draw back was the USB cable on the case is very short and was problematic when plugging it in to charge. I found it easier to just plug it straight into a battery pack rather than my laptop or an outlet adapter. Other features were nice, the various functions, being somewhat heavy duty, water resistant, etc. While they do feel heavy duty though, the weight in my ear was not pleasant. Even if the ear loops were adjustable, I probably would not have kept them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I remember trying out the first iteration of the Epic Air True wireless earbuds and not being very impressed at all. But after going back to the drawing board and making two more updated versions, I think we are at a very happy place in our lives as true wireless users. JLab has put together a set of earbuds that not only are comfortable to wear and sound great, but they also last forever. I can't get over how they've managed to pack so much power into something so compact. 70 hours of total playtime on a single full charge. 15 hours per use and 55 more hours waiting in the charging case. It also comes with enough ear gummies to fit any ear lobe. Plus the case has wireless charging to eliminate the need for a charging brick. However, if you need to hook it up to your laptop, there's a connected USB attached to the charging case that folds away neatly( 70 flippin' hours people!!). It's water and dirt resistant and there's also active noise cancellation built in. There are 3 different listening modes that allow for Bass boost, Movie Mode and a mode that allows you be more aware when you're out on a street jog. Appropriately called Be Aware Mode. The Wear Detect sensor stops playback on your tunes when you take your earbuds out of your ear. There's much done right here. A major improvement over previous iterations, and even surpassing other big named earbuds on the market. The JLab Air ANC app allows you to customize your listening experience on the fly, while keeping on the go, but the touch controls are easy and responsive if you just need a quick change up. The only qualm I have, is the charging case is a little too big for my liking. But I understand, considering the size of the earbuds and attached hooks. Way to go JLab! Keep bringing the noise. I definitely recommend these at the price of $149.99"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are looking for amazing earbuds that stay put, noise canceling, active noise control, wireless charging and sweatproof just to mention a few, but are not looking to spend a lot of money then look no further. JLAB EPIC AIR SPORT ANC are great earbuds that sound good, are packed with tons of features and actually give you active noise control for a very reasonable price. These have become my new favorite earbuds. So let’s go over some of the features, sounds quality and things that need some improvement. So as I write this review I currently have my earbuds in and listening to some music and I cant hear a thing around me which is awesome, but what I did notice was that the noise canceling works best with the provided “Cloud Foam” ear tips they also make wearing the ear buds more comfortable, almost as if you don’t have them in and finally they keep them in place. So, thumbs up for the ear tips and the active noise control. The Epic Air Sport ANC are packed with features such as touch controls, Active noise control, Wireless + Usb charging case, IR wear detect senor, dual connect, calling, movie mode, AIR ANC APP and finally IP66 sweatproof. Touch Control- The touch controls on the earbuds work great for volume control, answering phone calls, and even brining up your virtual assistant on your phone. You are also able customize the touch controls to fit your needs. Active Nose Control- The active noise control on these earbuds work great along with the “Be Aware” option which lets you hear ambient sound around you so that you’re not completely absent but these options worked the best with the cloud foam ear tips. Wireless and USB Charging- When I first opened the packaging, I thought I was missing a charging cable until I started to look for the charging port and found built in charging cable under the case, with a perfect fit, along with the wireless charging symbol. Although the charging cable is a bit short, but it alleviates you from carrying around a charging cable with you and with the wireless charging you don’t even need to worry the length of the cable. IR Wear Detect Sensor- There are tiny infrared sensors built into each bud which allows you to automatically pause and play your music when you take them out and put them back in. Dual Connect- The dual connect option allows you to connect either one for both of the earbuds. Both earbuds have microphones built in so each one can be used independently. So, in case you lose one, you can still use the other one. FIT and Sweatproof- These earbuds stay put while working out and are so easy on the ears. I have owned other pairs of earbuds where they start hurting after a while but honestly I had no issues with these. The cloud foam tip made the experience even better. The ANC APP Now this is where I had some issues. The App is nice and it’s a great way to customize the touch controls, control the levels of Active Noise control and ambient noise, control the equalizer. Where I had my issues was with the update. Even though the app was showing me that I had an update and every time I tried to perform the update nothing happened or I got an error, but no big deal, the ear buds still fit great and performed well. All in all, solid earbuds for the price. I would highly recommended anyone looking for earbuds to check these out. You will not be disappointed.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds look good, have a great design, are loaded with convenient features, and perform well...all for an affordable price. They sound good, have great battery life (with an impressive charging case), and come with in-ear detection and the ability to use both or just one earbud (which I love for around the house stuff). Further, they have Active Noise Control, which, while not perfect, worked well for me. Lastly, and extremely important to me, they fit me well and are very comfortable. They come with plenty of tips, so you “should” also be able to find a good fit. All in all, I like these buds, what they do, how they do it, and I think they are a great value.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JLab Epic Sport has a really good fit with a variety of ear tips makes these fit just right for about anyone. The charging case is smaller than others. The noise canceling and audio quality is one of the best for a true wireless sport device. The battery life is adequate with the noise canceling running all day, with this setting you get about 7-8 hours. The pairing between various devices is a bit cumbersome but you get used to it, it’s just not the best. Overall I recommend this product if you need good fitting truly wireless headphones. They’re affordable and do a great job at delivering audio on the go.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JLab has done it again by delivering a good amount of features, good sound quality as well as noise cancelling in their latest earbuds the Epic Air Sport ANC's. The included charging case supports both usb and wireless charging and in the packaging they also include a plethora of earbud tips that should cover the majority of ear canal shapes. For this model they've made a smartphone app available that lets you customize the touch press actions and the strength of the Be Aware Audio and Active Noise Cancelling features as well as allowing you to upgrade your earbuds firmware. The sound quality of the earbuds is great and the ANC complements the sound nicely be drowning out some of the outside noise. The Epic Air Sport ANC's are a great buy and they come with a worry free 2 year warranty as well as IP66 water resistance so it makes it very easy for me to recommend them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Lots of features and superior sound for not a lot of money. These are my new favorites that I go to nearly every time. The active noise cancellation is awesome but so is the Be Aware feature that allows you to select the option of letting in surrounding noises to keep you aware of what's going on around you such as car noise while on a walk, etc. They are very sleek and compact as comfortable as well. Sound quality is awesome as well as the battery life. Multiple ear bud tip covers are included so Im sure a comfortable option exists for you,"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are of good value, I like running and these headphones will stay put, I like how they feel and look. I like how the case does have the USB charger cable. I do like how long the battery lasts, I also like how it comes with different sizes to accommodate different people. The sound is good and the noise cancelling is ok. I think they are of good value.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Worth it!! Price is very reasonable for a true wireless earphone. Quality so far is great, no regrets so far. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family to buy.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my second pair of JLab earbuds, and at least my 6th pair overall. It’s been difficult to find a single pair that could do everything I desire- sound great, wear comfortably, endure workouts (perspiration and stay in place), control easily, hold a decent charge and look good. This pair does it all. They come up short on one category - controls and added a component that will only get better - customization via an app. The build quality is nice, the Epic Air Sport ANC True Wireless Earbuds (Quite a name) feel durable and of high quality, yet are light and comfortable on and in my ears. They are packaged with several cushions of varying materials and sizes so you can find the right fit. The charging case is a bit large, but also durable, and is no doubt the secret to the battery life. A nice touch- it features a permanently connected standard USB “cable”. No searching for another cable (nor having ANOTHER cable!). It has 4 LEDs on the exterior that tell you it’s charging and how much battery is remaining. They pair easily, but you can only have them paired to play to a single device at a time. Not a huge deal to me. The app was a great surprise. Customizations include: +Noice Canceling level +Be Aware sensitivity (passes through ambient sounds. Important for when you’re out and about) +Pre-set and Adjustable Equlization +Left and Right Earbud button control settings Most important, they sound really good. I listen to a lot of podcasts and there’s nothing more frustrating than poorly reproduced voices when listening to someone talk for 2 hours. I also enjoy a wide range of music genres: everything from instrumental Jazz to Alt to Hard Rock. Nice bass range, Treble that handled most of what I could through and of course, good mid-range. Finally, the over-the-ear loops performed well. COVID makes them frustrating if you have to wear a mask, but it’s not a design flaw at all. Super pleased with the product, and the price is really, really good.']"

My only complaint is the fact they don turn off, and if they break after warranty, you have to pay $300 just to have them repaired by Apple or replaced.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I told myself i’d never be able to justify buying these for the price, but they went on sale and I caved. Needless to say, best headphones I have ever used. The noise cancellation is so good I can’t hear a single thing when I turn it on, and it’s almost dangerous. New update for Lossless audio as well made it a large factor to my purchase. I have Beats Studio Pros and honestly, they do not compare. I usually get headaches from them being on my head for long periods of time, but not with these. The mesh really helps with the pressure on your head.

My dad’s a bit of an audiophile, and he couldn’t stop raving about the spatial audio, the noise cancellation, and how crisp and full everything sounded — whether it was his jazz records or a phone call with me. He even joked that he was hearing parts of songs he’d never noticed before. Mission accomplished. BUT… let’s be real — the price did make me hesitate. They are definitely on the steeper end, and I had to pause for a minute (or three) before hitting “Add to Cart.” That said, seeing how much my dad loves them and the fact that he uses them every single day makes it feel almost worth it.

The headset feels comfortable, with soft ear cups, though larger ears may have an issue with there overall size. And although pricy, if this headset can last a couple years without issues, I\'d argue it\'s worth it. The only potential issue I may have is the plastic housing connected to where the ears pivot, previous SteelSeries headsets I\'ve owned have broken there, almost every time. It could be an issue though (hopefully) not after years of use.', ""After watching reviews, talking with fellow gamers and being deperate for better microphone setup for my PC, i went for the Nova Pro Wireless, i wanted the side tone to keep myself from yelling too loud at night, the chat/game audio balance and the Sonar mixer for controlling different audio channels has been awesome. Even got to clean up my own voice with the equializer on the mic. Swappable batteries are amazing, long lasting, yet ready to swap when needed.

I have been gaming for 25+ years and I’ve been buying a headset pretty much every other year and I have to say this is the best headset I’ve ever owned. The quality of the sound is just immaculate. Games that i usually play that have low volume on other headsets I own are a whole nother experience now! If you like rpg games like myself prepare yourself to hear every little tiny sound. Not only that but I love how simple the design is, they are simple yet modern looking. I can’t say enough good things about the extra battery and never running out of battery so I never have to wait for my headset to charge. It’s like a dream come true.

I love all of the new features because I upgraded from an Apple Watch three series. Also, it is very lightweight.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SE=Short on Expense, Smart on Features! I have always loved the SE's if you can't afford a better series. They still pack a punch and at a small loss of fraction. In this situation, we get power internal components and only lose 1mm of screen size. This worked out as a perfect gift to a female companion and she loves it. Short on Expense, but DEFINITELY has more than just that!!!! SE = Smart Essentials – Emphasizes that the Apple Watch SE covers all the essential features at a lower cost. SE = Streamlined Experience – Highlights the balance between features and affordability, focusing on a smooth user experience. SE = Sensible Edition – Suggests that it’s a practical choice for those who want core features without the premium price. SE = Savvy Economy – Points out that it’s a smart and economical option for those budget-conscious users.

Apple AirPods Max (USB-C) Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Purple,$649.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/apple-airpods-max-usb-c-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-purple/18470963/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these headphones and use them everyday since purchasing. The sound is great and noise cancellation is immaculate. Battery Life is amazing too. Sidenote: I’ve been on 1% the past 2-3hrs. The color is nice I’m happy these are Lavender because my options are low when it comes to my color. No fading or scratches. I did get a protective cover for them though so I’d recommend even though it’s durable. Only thing I don’t like is that you have to have it in the case to turn off. It also gets dirty easily since it’s white, BUT you can take these apart and wash them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the color, sound is what i expect from Apple. Would give it a 5 star but it lacks in the communication part. Answer a phone call while wearing theses babies the person on the other end thinks your ima tunnel or something. You have to basically scream at the top your lungs so they can hear you. And another issue I have been getting not sure if any one else is experiencing this but, while I’m listening to music they randomly disconnect and randomly connect again… very very annoying!!!!!But others than that so far I’ll give it 4 stars.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing sound quality. Long lasting battery all day. And love transparency mode!! Tk you Apple', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So comfortable And Good Bettery backup I love the the colour!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these headphones! They’re beautiful, I love the color. I also love how loud they sound, I thought my other pair of headphones were loud but not according to these. This is my very first time trying the noise cancellation feature and I must say that I’m enjoying it. I love when I go out that i can just press the feature and not hear anything. It feels like im in a whole other world when i put these on. This is also my first pair of airpod maxes, I’ve wanted these for a long time. I’m glad I waited long enough for them to bring out a purple color. The price could be fairer though, I don’t think anyone should be paying over $500 for any pair of headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have both the AirPods Max and the Sony XM5, and honestly, the Sony ones are way better. Why? They have better battery life, are more comfortable on my head, and are less expensive. The AirPods Max are very aesthetically pleasing and slightly better noise cancellation, but they start to hurt my head after just 30 minutes of wearing them, and I find myself charging them almost every other day. With my Sony headphones, I can go a month without charging, and they still perform great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I LOVE. they’re pricey but SO worth it. the color is perfect, the sound is astounding, they’re comfortable, the battery life is impeccable. i’ll stress how worthy the investment is to anyone.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Yes, people think they are wildly expensive, but if you love your Apple ecosystem like me, get them! I was worried about them being too heavy and uncomfortable, but after about maybe 3 days of figuring out what’s the best position to wear on my head and ears (i have small ears), I have adjusted pretty well and they don’t cause me discomfort. They connect seamlessly through all of my Apple devices. Accessories make them even more stylish. The aesthetic, the connectivity, the noise canceling and surround sound, all amazing. Not water resistant so be careful in the shower.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me clarify— i dont have three pairs of AirPod Max’s currently. First I bought pink, didn’t really ever like the color. Worked fine. Traded for green (loved the color), also worked fine, then purple (this girl’s fave color) came out, and I really wanted them! So, traded in the green for the purple. I am completely immersed in the Apple ecosystem (Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, MacBook, AirPod Pros.. all the Apple things), so it made sense to me to get over-the-ear headphones from Apple. I was having some connection difficulties with my Apple TV at first, so I googled the issue and found a solution on Reddit that fixed it. I work from home 90% of the time, and I wear the headphones basically all day, whether I’m at home or in the office, so they get plenty of use. I got clear covers for the ear pads and the headband off of Amazon along with covers for the ear cups (off Amazon too) for some protection. I got AppleCare, but I’m hoping I never have to use it. I haven’t had the purple ones long enough to comment on longevity, and I’ve heard the horror stories where they break/brick… I guess I’m just willing to take that risk. They’re stupid expensive… I do NOT think the price is fair… but that’s everything Apple, right? Anyways, I love them so far!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] got them for my wifes birthday using my credit card! 12 months interest free!']"

These BuddyPhones Play+ are perfected for that they only go so loud so he can still hear the tablet and there not to loud to hurt his ears. The tops of a soft padding so they don't hurt the top of his head, and also the padding on the headphones themselves are perfected also so they don't hurt his ears. The BuddyPhones Play+ connected easy to his tablet no troubles at all. I love them because my son could walk around the whole house and the BuddyPhones Play+ dis not disconnect he left his tablet in the kitchen and walked about 20ft to the bathroom it stayed connected the whole time. It would have been neat if instead of stickers it was interchangeable clips or somthing but my son still enjoyed them.

We definitely recommend and will continue to use."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These buddy headphones fit both of my toddlers pretty well.  I felt that the volume settings were a bit on the loud end when trying the volume at full capacity.  But since I can monitor it from my phone it is not much of a concern.  We used these on a longer car ride to keep them occupied with learning songs while not disturbing their siblings.  When trying the headphones with my phone music it did make a difference how close I was to the phone.  It did come in and out once I reached approximately 35 feet away from the device.  Overall, I love how long the battery kept charged and that they were comfortable enough that the kids kept them on!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son loves this headset. After the distance learning started he realized the importance of a headset but this Buddyphones headset is much better than the previous one. Especially since it’s wireless it prevents the hassle of tangling around with wires. The charging is quick and easy the charge stays well for 20hours. Very good battery life. It has nice features. The stickers are so cool too. The safe audio technology is great for kids ears. It has toddler mode and kids mode which has different decibels. And there is a travel mode too. Love that the sound clarity is amazing and Bluetooth connectivity is great. Very clear audio quality and very efficient too.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones have been great! We (the adults) love the sound control option on them, the children, not so much, but we love that we're able to help preserve their hearing, as they'd play their videos for school and streaming at full max with them on. The stickers that came with them are really cute and the cushioned headband portion is an added bonus. They're super durable and pair nicely with another set of Play+ headphones so the kids can both learn the same lesson, or watch the same movie! I've even used them a few times, just to listen to some audio books. If adults are going to use them, I wouldn't recommend using them for working out as they're not for drowning out background noises such as the sound of your footfalls on a treadmill, other than that the sound quality is great and they pair quickly and easily via bluetooth or aux cord!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are the best headset that my daughter has had, being able to control the volume and that she cannot turn it up more than allowed is one of the best things you can find in them, so you avoid damaging her hearing system. It is an excellent option to be able to use it wired or wirelessly since if the battery runs out and you are not at home to recharge it, you can continue using it wired!!!! The battery lasts approximately 20 hours of use which is a long time and it has a microphone included, it also brings some stickers to personalize it and they are very cute. I highly recommend it for 3-8yrs.', 'I was nothing but a helpful useful tool for the kids esp during thus stay home online classes. Of course its buddy sharing function is a total game-changer but i also love the idea that both the kids can listen and study in their own without distractions from one another. The rest if the functions is just phenomenal and perfect for kids.', 'The wireless feature is great and helpful on the go for outdoor exercise and around the house especially during her online classes and watching movies.

There are two different modes for that, one is POP Mode which goes to 94dB max, the second is SAFE Mode which goes to 85dB max.

I think that is fantastic that they can customize these however they choose. Lastly, these are very comfortable, and have the anti-allergic cushion.

Here's what I think: Comfort and Fit: Google says these are comfy, and they mostly are. They feel secure, which is great. But since I have really small ear canals, even the smallest tips made my ears hurt a bit after a while. On Android, there's a cool feature that checks if you have a good fit and seal. I found that really helpful! Sound Quality and Noise Canceling: The sound is seriously impressive. Music sounds clear with a nice bass. The noise canceling is amazing. I work in an office with four other people, and with these on, I couldn't hear them at all! It was like they weren't even there. The sound quality and noise canceling together made for a truly immersive experience. Google AI and Features: Google Assistant works smoothly on Android. Controlling music, asking questions, and getting notifications without using my hands is really convenient. Android vs. iOS Experience: Here's the difference between using these with my iPhone and my Android tablet: Android (Pixel phone or other Android device): Setup was super easy with my Android tablet. Everything works seamlessly, especially the fit test feature. Plus, the settings on Android let you use presets or manually adjust the sound to make it sound exactly how you like it. iOS (iPhone): You can still connect via Bluetooth, and the sound and noise canceling are still great. But you don't get some of the extra Android features, like quick pairing and some Google Assistant stuff. It's like using really good Bluetooth earbuds. Things to Consider: Price: These are premium earbuds, so they cost more. Ecosystem: If you use a lot of Apple products, AirPods might be a better fit. But if you have an Android phone or use Google services, these are a strong contender."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product in exchange for my honest review, and I must say I am so happy with them! 😊 the Google Pixel Buds Pro are some of the best wireless headphones I have used!

Second favorite is the noise cancelling, it works great (best I've ever had in ear buds although my big over ear Sonys headphones are still a bit better) and the small size is so convenient for the gym or even just grocery shopping.

There are lots of options for different sound types such as bass, and super bass which I use, and others. They also have a good design. I highly recommend', 'After years of searching, I have found the most versatile, high fidelity ear buds on the market! As someone who travels nationally on a weekly basis, these headphones are an absolute GAME CHANGER! The quality is fantastic, the touch controls are ultra convenient, and the ability to connect to multiple devices at once make it easy to seamlessly switch between connected devices. I had a pair of brand name ear buds that have since been forced into retirement because these are FAR superior. No matter what environment you are in, these ear buds are an absolute work horse and i’m never leaving the house, gym, office, or airport without them!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are pretty solid ear buds. They work well while i am sitting out on the Lanai and trying to not blast my neighbors out in the middle of the night with my sound bar. Distance fro my phone to the ear buds, works to about 20 feet. That’s about how far my bathroom is when i realied i forgot to put my phone in my pocket. They could be louder, but that is only because my hearing is not the best in my late 40’s. The sound would probably be reat if youwere under 25. But then again, you’d probably end up hearing like i almost do in your late 40’s. Base is pretty good for ear buds. The app is cool. Has an eq to adjust to hope you can hear it. Seems to hit all the great tones, i think. Set it the way i’d set my stereo. Would love to find a software upgrade to make it louder, like the fountain of youth or something loke that. All that being said, my wife does not yell at me for blasting music in the house and i am pretty satisfied with the tunes i listen to on these. The multiple ear adapters are pretty cool too. I would recommend for anyone. Kids, tell me how awesome they really sound! Too many concerts for my ears.', 'I absolutely love these earbuds! They have the perfect combination of aesthetics, tactile feel, comfort, in-ear stability, sound quality and even voice recognition. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of noice-canceling and ability to automatically reduce that when it picks up talking voices nearby. At the price point these earbuds sit at, it’s a no brainer purchase. These are highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience. Technics have been around for so many years and constantly produce quality products. I’m a fan for life!', 'I travel once a month and use noise cancelling EarPods to avoid airplane noise, I used the AirPods Pro for a while, but after 30 minutes of use, my right ear hurts (quite a bit). The hard plastic and non-confirming form of the Apple product is not universal, and even with different tips, the hard plastic is what hit my ear and made it hurt. I gave the Technics AZ60M2s a try and I loved them. They are super comfortable and I can use them for prolonged periods of time without any issues. Also, the sound is clearer, both for music and for calls, I tested calling 3 people twice each, they all said I sounded better while using the Technics. It is better to use something that makes sense, and not just go for looks and/or the hype. I highly recommend these earbuds!!!', 'In the past I had Jabra Active elite 65t’s which were amazing and lasted me five years. Unfortunately they don’t sell them anymore so I looked for new earbuds. These aren’t it; they’re too large for my ears, even with all the different ear nubs. I also hate the touch controls because I use these in the gym and in the air, and I always accidentally trigger them. Returned these. If those are not concerns for you—these earbuds were great quality, felt really secure, good noise cancellation, and great sound quality.', 'I got these earbuds a while back and have not been able to put them down. I’m constantly using them for school, editing sessions, and the gym. The crazy part is that they last the entire day and still have a lot of battery left. The noise cancellation is also really great and excels compared to other earbuds. They are also super compact and fit in my ear perfectly. They come with different silicone sizes so they will fit anyone and everyone perfectly. I definitely recommend to anyone.', 'After my AirPods broke (speaker burst) I was in major need of wireless earbuds. Not only do I use them to listen to music while working out, but I also rely on them for making calls on the go. My car is older and I don’t have Bluetooth connectivity while driving, so the single earbud use is really effective. I love the multiple ear sizes for the perfect fit regardless of your ear type! The audio app is available too if you want to really customize your listening experience!', 'The noise-cancelling on these earbuds is unlike anything I’ve experienced thus far. I thought my AirPods did a good job until I put these in for the first time. The sound is crystal clear and with the addition of the app to EQ, I am able to hear my music in much better quality than I’ve been able to previously. The call quality is noticeably clearer to my call recipients and the wireless charging makes this just as easy to work into your daily routine as AirPods.', 'Easier buds were some of the best I have ever tried. Not only were they comfortable in my ear for all day use, but they had incredible quality for both phone calls and my music. The noise cancellation was also wonderful as they give you so many different earbud sizes to choose from, so you get the perfect fit for your ear. I would definitely recommend you try these over any of the other popular earbuds on the market today. You’ll be happy you did.']"

I love that it comes with 6 sizes to find the perfect fit. The case is small and perfect to carry in your pocket. It charges with USB-C charging cable. All you gotta do is download the Soundcore APP on your phone and you can custom your earbuds anyway you like for music or watching content. If you're looking for a really good pair of earbuds, check these out! You won't be disappointed!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was super excited to try out these new earbuds. You can listen for up to 3hrs without charging. There are five tip sizes to choose from, plus the app lets you do a fit test. The sound from these buds are crystal clear. The noise blocking feature tho needs work because it does not block out 100% of noise. The buds are also a little chunky, so if you have small ears like me, they will stick out. Overall, I think these are decent for the price.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love the look, feel, and sound quality of the Space A40 wireless earbuds. Firstly, the storage case/charging station for these wireless earbuds is so well-made and compact. I just like the overall feel of the case, it just feels high quality. It also charges the earbuds really quickly. I have tiny ears and a lot of times my earbuds fall out. These wireless earbuds came with a lot of different size tips, including xs, which is the size I chose to use and they were perfect.

I'm definitely going to make these my daily earbuds. I just love them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds have been working out really well for me. I am impressed on how light and comfortable they are in my ears. I tried all of the sizes and found the smallest size to fit me perfectly. The small size also fits my husbands ears which surprised him so I'd recommend trying them all to get your best fit. The Soundcore app has a fit test which will tell you if you're seating the earbuds in your ears correctly. It also has a hear id hearing test so it adjusts the volume of different frequencies. The battery life is excellent, I've been using them hours on end and have not recharged them. My husband has used them for work and they lasted all day. The ANC is much better than previous earbuds I've owned. The case works on our existing wireless charger so we don't have to plug them in often which is convenient. Great earbuds and I'd highly recommend!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are worth the price. They fit snuggly in my ear and come with multiple ear pieces for different sizing options. When I am wearing these headphones I can see people’s mouth move but not hear anything! The noise cancelation is better then any other headphone set I have had. I like the black color and case because it hides dirt and any smudges. A full charge lasts me a couple days which is so nice.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the Soundcare Space A40 SE earbuds a few days ago and they are great. The first thing is how small is the case!!! It fits in all pockets, this is very useful when moving all the time. The second thing is the connection reliability, it connects to all your devices quickly without trouble. I like a lot that you can connect two devices, it is useful if you want to stay connected to your phone while working on your computer. The third thing is the noise cancelling, it works great. Partially because it is an intra ear earbuds but also because of its technology. The forth thing is the battery time, the earbuds are small but you can get about 10h of charge, that is insane!!! and you can charge them 4 or 5 times with the case. Basically you can go for almost a week off grid. The fifth thing is the audio quality, it is is very good like it seems you are in a music studio. My only little concern is that after some times, they pop out of my ears, especially when moving around. So I would not recommend them for running. In conclusion great earbuds and very good noise cancelling.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I couldn't wait for these to come in the mail !!!! I was so excited about them cause I have heard nothing but good things about them reading reviews and etc on them and they really do their job for me, too using them to listen to music on phone tablet computer whatever device these are really good. To traveling going on a walk whatever it may be they are great. They are really tiny so easy to hide, but the battery on them last a long time, and are very well built to last.

One complaint is that when running or working out outside the wind makes a rattling noise which can be slightly annoying.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have a pair of Anker headphones that I use that are wired so seeing a wireless version was exciting. Anker makes quality items and this is no exceptional. The sound quality was excellent (could maybe use a little more bass for my personal preferences) and crisp.

Here's what I think: Comfort and Fit: Google says these are comfy, and they mostly are. They feel secure, which is great. But since I have really small ear canals, even the smallest tips made my ears hurt a bit after a while. On Android, there's a cool feature that checks if you have a good fit and seal. I found that really helpful! Sound Quality and Noise Canceling: The sound is seriously impressive. Music sounds clear with a nice bass. The noise canceling is amazing. I work in an office with four other people, and with these on, I couldn't hear them at all! It was like they weren't even there. The sound quality and noise canceling together made for a truly immersive experience. Google AI and Features: Google Assistant works smoothly on Android. Controlling music, asking questions, and getting notifications without using my hands is really convenient. Android vs. iOS Experience: Here's the difference between using these with my iPhone and my Android tablet: Android (Pixel phone or other Android device): Setup was super easy with my Android tablet. Everything works seamlessly, especially the fit test feature. Plus, the settings on Android let you use presets or manually adjust the sound to make it sound exactly how you like it. iOS (iPhone): You can still connect via Bluetooth, and the sound and noise canceling are still great. But you don't get some of the extra Android features, like quick pairing and some Google Assistant stuff. It's like using really good Bluetooth earbuds. Things to Consider: Price: These are premium earbuds, so they cost more. Ecosystem: If you use a lot of Apple products, AirPods might be a better fit. But if you have an Android phone or use Google services, these are a strong contender."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product in exchange for my honest review, and I must say I am so happy with them! 😊 the Google Pixel Buds Pro are some of the best wireless headphones I have used!

Second favorite is the noise cancelling, it works great (best I've ever had in ear buds although my big over ear Sonys headphones are still a bit better) and the small size is so convenient for the gym or even just grocery shopping.

I mainly had my son in mind when I was presented with this offer. He’s only 7.5 and mainly uses the audio feature -( not so much for talking to others right now since he’s too young in my opinion for that), but for audio purposes and keeping it quiet in house it’s been perfect with the Nintendo Switch! Audio is clear even when I used it, but it lacks any noise cancelling features. Honestly, it’s perfect for him especially when I need to get him to take a break instead of me repeating myself or yelling. Ear pads are super comfortable and give that cloud puff effect when resting against your ears. Headset is adjustable even for him it fits for most part. Does require to be wired into controller or gaming console depending on your device is the only draw back - especially if you have been spoiled with other wireless tech. Arrived sealed with tamper proof sticker and even came with handset clothe cover holder. So thankful for Influenster and Razer for giving me this opportunity for me and my family to enjoy next level gaming!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first got my hands on the Razer BlackShark V2 X for PlayStation, I knew it would be a perfect gift for my brother.

He immediately plugged it into his console, and the difference in quality was evident. The sound was crisp and immersive, making him feel like he was right in the middle of the action. He mentioned that the audio clarity was top-notch, and the microphone quality was equally impressive, providing clear communication with his teammates. Not only was the sound quality great, but the headset also felt incredibly comfortable. He wore it for hours without any discomfort, which is a huge plus for those long gaming sessions. The lightweight design and plush ear cushions definitely made a difference. Overall, giving my brother the Razer BlackShark V2 X was a fantastic decision.

Those reviews come from the official website so its just a self promotion. To give an unbiased opinion, the Sudio A1's are not what you get for the price. The sound quality is below average, with terrible mild bass, non-existent sub-bass, and plausible high frequency sounds. However, there are also some features Sudio has exceled with. First off when you open the box, it is a pretty good presentation with the earbuds, manual, and nicely packaged cable. Quality seems expected. I have tested the battery life and it is what is advertised. It lasted under 7 hours for when I last used. Connectivity such as pairing are fast and simple. Another thing to keep in mind is that the earbud case has a matte finish and so are the earbuds. Hinges and closing are average with a light high pitched clap sound. Definitely not Apple quality but it'll work.

They also have Transparency mode and trust me it gives you super hearing. With Transparency mode on, you can hear sound, noise, words, pictures from 11 miles away. I heard your kid at a COD lobby saying every curse in existence. The most impressive thing is that these bad boyds have Spatial Audio. You heard that right, Sudio is the first company in the world to implement this feature into their earbuds. They give 360 audio and they give you the ability to teleport into the place based on the music you play like im not even kidding. They also got touch, sensor, and motor control so you can control whats playing through your phone using telekinesis. Last thing I need to mention is that the most innovative thing is that these good boys have something called wireless charging, THATS RIGHT, this is the most inspiring and helpful thing a company has done.

Upon unzipping, you're presented with this elegant device and a magnetic repository that holds the USB-C to C charging cable and a USB-C to 3.mm (mini) stereo jack. I wish the stereo cable was a little longer, but hey, these ARE wireless via Bluetooth. The build quality is excellent, and the weight feels good in hand and on your head. I was able to wear them for over an hour with no discomfort. After that time, I fidgeted a little with the earpads. This will of course vary be the shape of your head and ears. Acoustic isolation with and without ANC turned-on is very good. With ANC on, I never heard any ambient nose. Perfect for offices and airplanes. Phone calls were heavenly. Great sound on my end, and never a complain from people on the other end of my calls. The 40mm drivers reproduce voices very well on calls as well as when listening to podcasts and music. My music taste is eclectic. I have some reference albums I tested via both an online music service on my phone and direct from phone. Synchronicity by the Police, Diana Krall's Live from Paris, STP's Plush (acoustic and original), Gregory Porter and Thus Sprach Zarathustra will test any audio equipment. The Px7 S2e performed well across the board. I occasionally had to just slightly tweak the treble and/or bass via the Bowers&Wilkins Music App (where you can also update software and adjust ANC). These reproduce music very closely to the way it was recorded. Exactly what a fine piece of equipment is supposed to do. Between the beauty of design and sound, I find myself looking for reasons to use the Bowers & Wilkins headphones as frequently as possible. Get these - for yourself or a friend!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bowers & Wilkins are synonymous with high-end quality audio products and the Px7 S2e wireless headphones live up to the reputation with great audio and build quality. My blue Px7 S2e headphones come in an elegant matching blue pouch that sets the expectation. They look and feel great and well built. The set-up is straightforward and starts with downloading the ‘Music I Bowers & Wilkins’ app. From there, the headphones are detected and connected via Bluetooth. The app itself is simple and shows the status of the headphones, it has a good tutorial and you can play your music by connecting streaming services such as qobuz and Tidal that offer high-resolution music and other services such as TuneIn, deezer and Soundcloud. It has a simple equalizer to control the highs and the lows. The headphones have simple control buttons on the right earphone such as the power/Bluetooth button, two buttons to increase and decrease the sound and an action button for music playback and phone calls. The left earphone has one action button that can be customized from the app. The headband has a soft padded contour and the earpads are soft enough to be worn for hours without strain. The battery lasts for days but is shortened when playing a lot of high resolution music. Now for the performance, those headphones may be considered entry-level but the sound is truly premium especially while playing high resolution music. I took a free trial of qobuz that offers thousands of 24-bit and 16-bit formats songs. Those headphones truly came alive playing high resolution songs. The 40mm drivers delivered crispy clear sound from the highs all the way down to the deep lows. Listening to some Bob Marley and Radiohead songs blew my mind. I had a hard time going back to ‘normal’ resolution music listening again. However, those headphones still delivered solid quality sound from regular streamers. Listening in noise canceling mode doesn’t deteriorate the sound quality, which I command the engineers at Bowers & Wilkins for a job well done. I own several premium headphones from well known manufacturers and I made a few head to head comparisons and the Px7 S2e came out on top not only with their superior sound but also with their better quality build. The app is not the best app out there but I like its minimalist approach and lets me do what I need to do. Those are the best headphones that I own and I would recommend them to anybody looking for high-end headphones at an entry-level price. I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Was pleased to receive the B&W Px7 S2e Ocean Blue headphones. They were boxed nicely, love the color and have a great zippered hard shell case. Included is a USB-C to USB-C cord and a USB-C to 3.5mm input cord. There is a Quick Start manual with a scan to download the app on your phone which walks you through the steps for setup. I proceeded to charge them (no charger included so I used my iPhone charger) and when the blinking green light turned solid they were at 100%. I then placed them on my head and first thing I noticed was the perfect fit. WOW! Comfortable as can be right out of the box. I wore them almost 9 hours straight and to my delight they did not start to hurt my ears or head in any way. I did notice a slight bit of sweat when I removed them but that's to be expected and it's not an issue with me. I am just so happy I can wear them for long periods and no discomfort. Even after the 9 hour usage the battery life was still great and B&W claims up to 30 hours on one charge. I believe it. On the left earcup there is one Quick Action button which handles Noise Cancellation, Pass-Through and OFF. It also will trigger the Voice Assistant. On the right earcup you'll find the power button which you simply push up to start the Bluetooth pairing mode or click it to turn the headphones off. Below that are the volume up and down buttons and in between is a grooved MULTI-FUNCTION button which handles Play, Pause, Next Track, Previous Track and accepts or declines phone calls. You just have to press from 1-3x for each function and for calls you hold 2 seconds to decline or press once to end a call you're on. These are the easiest to control headphones I've ever owned. I am using my iPhone for most Bluetooth functions as I subscribe to i-Tunes for music. I had no reason to really use any of the B&W apps except Spotify which I do have an account with. The volume on my phone also controls the headphones. There is a cool wear sensor built into them as well. Just lift an earcup to pause playback which you turn on in settings to activate. I did notice the provided link on the B&W app for FAQ's didn't work and it would have helped a little if it had. I enjoy using my iPhone directly to listen to whatever I am in the mood for ~ from Audiobooks to all genres of music, including my own music videos on Singsnap. With those 40mm drivers I am hearing things I never heard before when wearing my earbuds! Highs - Lows - Mids - EAR CANDY PERFECTION! I love these headphones! I have had no dropped or spotty Bluetooth signals, exceptional performance from the minute I put them on and I highly recommend their purchase. Definitely worth my 5 star (and more!) rating. You can't go wrong ~ they are out of this world AWESOME!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones in the stunning Ocean Blue color variant are some of the best headphones I have had the pleasure of using to date. Let me start by saying, these headphones are nothing short of a masterpiece. First and foremost, the design of these headphones are true testament to elegance and sophistication that Bowers & Wilkins have made here. The Ocean Blue finish is really sleek, and the build quality on these are exceptional. The headphones are not only aesthetically pleasing but also incredibly comfortable to wear. The memory foam ear cushions are lightweight and never once did they feel sweaty to me after wearing them for a 5 hour flight. These are perfect for long listening sessions. Bowers & Wilkins has truly outdone themselves when it comes to the sound quality in this department. The audio is nothing short of great. The headphones deliver a rich, detailed soundstage with deep, punchy bass, clear and crisp mids, and sparkling highs. Whether I was listening to music, an immersive action movie, or a funny podcast, the PX7 S2e headphones handled every genre with finesse, allowing me to hear nuances in my favorite tracks that I had never noticed before.The noise cancellation technology in these headphones is simply outstanding. It effortlessly blocked out all the background noise. Whether I was traveling on a noisy airplane, working in the office, or simply relaxing at home, the noise cancellation feature created a serene, uninterrupted listening experience. The PX7 S2e comes with a nice sturdy carrying case that has a pocket flap that stores the charging cable along with a 3.5mm headphone jack to USB-C adapter. The 3.5mm adapter is very clutch, especially if you’re someone who travels a lot and wants to use the entertainment screen on a plane, so you don't have to use those uncomfortable earbuds they give you. The battery life of the PX7 S2e headphones is impressive, offering hours of continuous playback on a single charge. The quick charge feature is always a nice addition, which provides hours of usage with just a short charge. This convenience ensures that my music and podcast are always within reach. I also appreciate the intuitive button controls on the ear cups, with the 3 buttons on the right ear cup allowing me to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with ease. Then on the left ear cup there is one button with the ability to switch between ANC and pass through Audio. The headphones seamlessly connect to all of my devices via Bluetooth/power switch, where you just hold it up for a couple of seconds and it will go into pairing mode and you’re good to go. The bluetooth connection on these are Phenomenal, in that I have had zero connection issues between my devices and they pair super easy with everything. Overall, the Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2e Wireless Noise Canceling Over-the-Ear Headphones in Ocean Blue are a true auditory delight. Their exquisite design, unparalleled sound quality, top-notch noise cancellation, and comfortable fit make them some of the best wireless headphones you can get. I am thoroughly impressed and can confidently say that they have elevated my listening experience to new heights."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e wireless over-ear headphones are a remarkable addition to the audio landscape, offering an evolved listening experience that stands out in its class. In this detailed review, we'll explore the features, usage impressions, and the pros and cons of these headphones. Features: The Px7 S2e headphones boast an impressive array of features that cater to both audiophiles and everyday users. With a 24-bit DSP and custom-designed 40mm drive units inspired by the flagship Px8 headphones, these headphones deliver a focused and engaging listening experience. The Hybrid Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology, powered by six microphones (4 ANC and 2 for telephony), ensures uninterrupted audio bliss, whether you're in a gaming session, on a long-haul flight, or commuting. Additional features include a Wear-Detection Sensor for intuitive playback control, Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX™ Adaptive for high-quality wireless audio, and a robust battery life of 30 hours playback (with 7 hours estimated on a 15-minute charge). The elegant design, luxurious memory foam earpads, and meticulous detailing make these headphones a blend of style and substance. Controls and Apps: The Px7 S2e offers physical controls on the device for convenient operation. The left earcup houses the Quick Action button. This button can be configured via the Bowers and Wilkins app for adjusting either the Environmental Control (default - toggles the noise cancellation settings between Pass-through, Off, and Noise Cancellation) or the Voice Assistant settings. The right earcup houses essential features like the Type-C charging port, status indicator, power /Bluetooth pairing button, volume controls and the play/pause/answer/hang-up button. For further customization, users can utilize the Bowers & Wilkins app on mobile, PC, and Mac. These apps empower users to personalize their audio experience by adjusting environmental settings, sound settings, connections (device priority), Quick action button, Device settings, allows one to rename the product, upgrade the firmware, and perform a factory reset. You can also use this to link to streaming services to keep all your listing in one place. Usage Impressions: The Px7 S2e headphones excel in providing a top-tier audio experience. Tested across a range of tracks, these headphones showcase their prowess in delivering natural high-end sound, thanks to the bio cellulose 40mm drivers. Comfort is prioritized with memory foam cushions designed for extended use, while the noise-canceling capabilities prove effective in various environments. Whether for music, gaming, or calls, the Px7 S2e headphone’s over-the-ear design ensures a comfortable audio experience for extended durations. Pros: - Exceptional audio quality - Impressive battery life (30 hours playback) - Portable and comfortable design - Versatile performance for various use cases Cons: - Potential high investment for some users In summary, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e headphones offer an evolved audio experience, combining cutting-edge technology with a sleek design. While the investment might be on the higher side for some, the audio quality, battery life, and overall performance make these headphones a worthy choice for those seeking an unparalleled wireless listening experience."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first pair of Bower + Wilkins headphones though not my first foray into the world of luxury premium audio products. That said, it probably comes as no surprise that the latest iteration of their entry-level wireless Bluetooth headphone, the Px7 S2e (‘E’ for evolved), delivers a deliciously satisfying listening experience. These headphones are designed with style and beauty in mind second only to its exceptional sound quality. The headphones come with a velvet-lined, zippered protective case that cleverly stows the USB-C to USB-C charging cable and USB-C to 3.5mm wired cable in a magnetic compartment in the middle. The minimalist monotone color palette used throughout complements soft curves and clean lines in its handsome yet durable construction. Adjusting the flexible headband feels smooth and seamless and is free of any creaks or clicks, and they fold flat for storage. These cans are weighty at around 11 oz but don’t feel heavy because of how well-balanced they are. The leatherette-lined headband offsets and distributes the weight, and the clamping force is firm but not uncomfortably tight. I like that oval ear cups are tall and wide with angled interiors, giving your ears more room inside the cup without adding bulk, and the soft leather pads create a good seal around the ear for isolation. This design also helps contain and direct the sound from the 40mm drivers into your ear canals. Upon powering on the headphones for the first time, my smartphone detected it immediately and even prompted me to download the accompanying B&W Music app. After creating an account or logging in, you’ll add the headphones to the app by pairing over Bluetooth 5.2, so you can change its settings. By default, noise cancelling is enabled, and it works well thanks to its use of 6 microphones to detect and eliminate background noise. The mics are also used when making hands-free calls for clear noise-free pickup of your voice. Alternatively, you can use the USB-C for a wired connection (up to 24-bit/48kHz), if your Bluetooth codec doesn’t support aptX Adaptive or HD for hi-res audio transmission. Pressing the quick action key on the left earpiece switches to pass-through mode which lets the mics pickup audio so that you can listen to your surroundings without taking the headphones off. Pressing once more toggles ANC off, but just note that without pass-through audio, the passive isolation of the ear cups is still quite good and sounds around you will be dampened. You can also change the function of this key to activate a voice assistant instead, so you can ask your AI questions, make calls, send texts, and control your IoT devices. The position of the key is convenient and places it just under your thumb when cupping the earpiece with your left-hand. The power switch and playback controls are similarly placed on the right ear cup. Since there are three physical keys to press, the middle multi-function button (MFB) is textured so you can differentiate and identify it, which also gives you a reference point to locate the volume buttons above and below it easily. For track skipping forward or back, you’ll double and triple press the MFB. In the app you can view the headphone’s battery life, which can last up to 30 hours on a full charge which takes only 2 hours. If you need a quick top up, just 15 minutes of charging can deliver 7 hours of runtime. There’s also an automatic standby feature that will put the device in low power after 15 minutes of inactivity and an adjustable wear sensor that automatically pauses what you’re listening to if you take the headphones off (or lift an ear cup off your ear) and resumes when you replace them. Both of these features can be toggled off in the app as well. The only EQ adjustments you can make in the app are to boost or reduce the treble or bass by up to +/- 6dB. There is no advanced control that will allow you to adjust the mid-ranges or get more granular. Ostensibly, this is because the sound engineers at B&W have already tuned the drivers to give you the most accurate listening experience, as recorded, though some music streaming apps may allow you to apply additional EQ adjustments. Speaking of, the sound that the Px7 S2e delivers natively is truly enjoyable. A bit bass heavy perhaps, but in a good way. Even so, the sound overall was full and detailed with bright trebles and rich, clean textures. The headspace and sound stage both felt adequately spacious though not large, per se, which is typical of closed back headphones. However, I found the stereo separation and imaging to be clean and precise. Overall, the listening experience with the Px7 S2e is satisfying, immersive, and comfortable even over longer listening sessions. You can pair them with up to two Bluetooth source devices simultaneously, and the battery lasts all day on a single charge. I also like the option of using them wired, though I found the volume levels are somewhat reduced when doing so.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have owned Bowers & Wilkins’ P7 (wired) headphones for years and have loved the build quality and the smoothness of their sound signature since day one. I couldn’t wait to see what their newest wireless headset with active noise cancellation, the Px7 S2e (the “e” stands for “evolved”), sounded like. B&W refers to these headphones as “entry level”, but all things are relative when your flagship speaker system has an MSRP of $100,000. Most people will equate “entry level” with $30 phones from a big box discounter, but these are not those. B&W has basically two over-the-ear headphones in their lineup, these and the Px8. There is the “original” Px7 S2 still being sold that the S2e evolved from, and there is also a McLaren Edition Px8 which is essentially a different trim of the “regular” Px8. The Px7 S2e has inherited some technical prowess from the Px8 in the form of the 24-bit digital signal processing, but lacks the carbon cones in the drivers of the Px8. However that does not make the Px7 S2e a slouch when it comes to music reproduction. The drivers in the ear cups are angled to produce a better focused sound stage, are a generous 40mm in diameter, and have the same low <0.1% total harmonic distortion of the top of the line product. You can see how technology marches on, as my P7 have a <0.3% THD spec. When you reach a certain price point in audio equipment, the sensory experience of the feel of materials and the visual elegance of the product takes on almost the same importance as the music reproduction. A Bowers & Wilkins product is a joy to hold in your hands as well as an optic treat for your eyes, and the Px7 S2e does not disappoint in either department. The world would be a better place if everything was designed as well and was built with as much care and pride. But these headphones are not simply form over function as the simple yet effective controls are laid out in an easy to comprehend configuration that can be navigated easily by feel. The right ear cup has four buttons positioned along the back edge that you operate with your right thumb and from the top down are a slide switch for on, off, and pairing, the volume up button, the multi-function button that controls play, pause, skip forward, and skip back, and lastly the volume down button. There is a small LED indicator immediately below the on/off switch to indicate if the headphones are turned on, charging, or in pairing mode. The multi-function button also comes into play when using the headphones for a phone call, as it controls answering a call, hanging up, rejecting a call, merging two calls, or muting the microphones. There is but a single button on the back edge of the left ear cup called the “Quick Action” button and it controls either the “Environmental Controls” which is toggling through Noise Cancelling On, Pass-Through On, Noise Cancelling and Pass-Through Off. “Pass-Through” allows some external sounds from the environmental or conversations to be heard without removing the headphones. Using the free Bowers & Wilkins Music app on your smartphone, the Quick Action button can instead be programmed to control the voice assistant on your listening device that is connected to the headphones. The ear cups contain sensors that can tell if one or both earpieces have been removed from your ear(s). The programming that is playing will be automatically paused when you lift an ear cup away from your head such as to listen to someone speaking to you, and if you remove the headphones completely, they will enter a power saving standby mode until you again place them on your head. The included accessories are a 45” charging cable which is USB-C to USB-C (no charging adapter is included), a 45” USB-C to 3.5mm mini phone plug to use with devices that do not have Bluetooth connectivity but have the appropriate jack, and a cloth-covered, form-fitted carrying case to hold the headphones that has a magnetically-latched compartment for the cords. The case should be billed as a storage case rather than a carrying case as it does not have a handle making it more suitable to be stowed in luggage rather than being toted about on its own. Having had the two big powerhouse brands in active noise cancelling headphones in our house, I can say the B&W technology is just as good in real-world use. Four microphones for noise cancelling and two microphones for voice make talking on the phone with the Px7 S2e a pleasurable experience even when discussing your car’s extended warranty. With colder weather approaching in many places, these over the ear headphones are a great accessory for listening to entertainment or catching up on phone calls when out for a walk as they help keep your ears warm in a way that ear buds just cannot do. The Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e comes in four monochromatic colors, blue, green, light gray, and black. All are pleasant, softly muted colors that complement the luxury appearance of the materials. The padded surfaces are not leather, but are a very good simulation and in no way distract from the expensive feel of the headphones. If you are looking for a great gift for the music lover in your life, or simply as a way to reward yourself, I can’t think of a better way than with this strikingly beautiful audio gear.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This review is for the Bowers& Wilkens (B&W) PX7 S2 headphones. I am thrilled to review these headphones because I am a huge fan of Bowers & Wilkens. I will not, however, give these headphones special treatment. I will review these headphones on their own standing in how they perform listening to music. I am not an audio snob, but I am an audiophile. I love music, and I love audio equipment that correctly reproduces music. After trying out numerous speakers for my home listening room, I settled on a set of B&W speakers. I did so because of the quality, nothing more. I listened to speakers costing 4 – 5 times more, and they didn’t sound much better if any at all. First impression: My first impression of the B&W PX7 S2 headphones was “typical B&W.” Upon opening the box, I saw the carry case that B&W provides for the headphones. It wasn’t a headphone bag, it was a high quality, rigid, fabric-covered form-fitted carrying case with a pocket for cables and a small charger. The headphones sat perfectly in the case. The headphones are a beautiful two-tone blue. They look elegant and expensive, a lot more expensive than they are. When I put them on, they were extremely comfortable. They seem to have found a perfect balance of grip without being too tight. The real test will be if they still feel that comfortable after a few hours of use. The pairing/power button is a slide on/off/momentary button that feels solid. It provides a good amount of resistance to make sure you don’t accidentally activate the momentary function. The other buttons are spaces appropriately, with the middle button being textured to help you identify where your finger is without having to count or remove your headphones. The USB port is both a charging port and a music port. If you have a headphone amp and want to listen to music through it, you can with the supplied USB to 3.5mm stereo cable. Test Setup: For this test, I used a Bluetooth connection to my Samsung S22 Ultra. I used Apple Music for the source, and played music from the genres of 60s – 90s rock, bluegrass, freak-folk, ska, metal, hip-hop, funk, rock operas, mellow, and instrumental piano. I spent about 4 hours on the first sitting, working through the entire list of genres. Later, on my second test, I listened to specific artists that I am familiar with so I could listen to songs I know and love and compare them to how I know they sound with my speakers and other headphones I use and love. I listened to Randy Newman, Dire Straits, Tami Neilson, Philip Glass, Efrem Bergman, Ludovico Einaudi, Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Holy Modal Rounders, Anthrax, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Social Distortion. Performance: On the first test session, I went through about 100 songs in about 4 hours. I was expecting to hear the headphones differ in performance when going from one genre to another. But what I found was that the headphones performed equally well across the entire spectrum. The highs were very crisp without being abrasive. The mids were bright, full, and did a great job on the ends of their spectrum, blending beautifully with the highs and lows. The bass was punchy and tight, and I never got them to distort, no matter how hard I drove the bass. Next, I moved to the second test session, listening to fewer songs and artists, but spending time with each one. I started with Randy Newman, because his music is not redundant in that every song is its own song, and each song on an album is different than the rest. On his Land of Dreams and Sail Away albums, the headphones performed beautifully. The quality of the music was equal across both albums, with each song working the highs, mids, and lows differently. The piano sounded like I was there, and the imaging was quite nice, not something you get from all headphones. The next album I listened to was Dire Straits’ Love Over Gold. This is one of my favorite albums ever. It is a hidden gem, as I don’t find too many people who have even heard of it; even people who like Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. The PX7 S2’s performed equally well on this album. The music really opened up, and the headphones did a great job reproducing the music, especially the instruments like the guitar on quieter pieces of music. As I went through the other artists, the headphones never ceased to amaze me. On some of my older music, the headphones did not make it sound better, but reproduced it like it sounded on a turntable back then. But when I played newer music, especially hip-hop, funk, and EDM, the mids were tight and bright, and the lows were deep and punchy. Never did the headphones strain from any music genre. Other features include a 30-hour battery. I believe this to be true, as I have not had the need to charge them up after the initial charge. The total charge time is 2 hours, and with a 15-minute charge, you will get 7 hours. Also is improved DSP for sound quality, 6 microphones – 4 for ANC and 2 for the telephone. There is only one feature on these headphones that are not excellent, and that is the noise cancellation. It does reduce noise, there is a clear difference. And it does so without affecting the music quality. But I have tested headphones that eliminate outside noise, and the PX7 S2s don’t quite eliminate the noise. Conclusion: The B&W PX7 S2 headphones are remarkable headphones. They performed beautifully in every genre I threw at them. They sounded better than headphones I have listened to that cost twice as much. The other headphones I have sound good but can’t maintain the same level of musical quality across the entire spectrum like these headphones. Some are weaker in the bass range, and one can get harsh in the highs if pushed. The B&W PX7 S2 headphones are replacing all of them and are my reference headphones going forward. In addition to the sound, these headphones are very comfortable. After multiple 4-hour long listening periods, my head and ears never got tired. The memory foam earpads cover the ear but do not put any pressure on it. These are some of the most comfortable headphones I have worn. I highly recommend the Bowers and Wilkens PX7 S2 headphones. Final thoughts: The thing to keep in mind with these headphones is how good they sound for the price. Headphones I have listened to in the same price range don’t sound this good. And with ANC technology and a wired connection in addition to Bluetooth, these headphones are a win-win.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have tried my fair share of noise cancelling headphones and ear buds in all ranges so I felt like I couldn't be surprised by these Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e Wireless Noise Cancelling Over the Ear Headphones in Ocean Blue. I am familiar with their noise canceling ear buds and really enjoy the sound they produce but some times I may need a more robust option like those you can get in a true over the ear headphone. Bowers & Wilkins doesn't disappoint. The Color is kind of unique and is just a great option to stand out in a crowd of black, white, and grey headphones out there. Battery life is better than other similar and popular options I have used with 30 hours to get you through any day or any trip. They are extremely comfortable on my ears where some others start to annoy me within the first hour. But the sound is what really impressed me. It Is clear with great bass and treble right out of the box but the ability to tweak it to your needs is a nice bonus. I got sucked into several hours of listening to various genres and truly enjoyed the clarity and crisp sounds regardless of what genre I was listening to. I tested these out using both my iPhone Pro Max as well as my MacBook Pro to listen to tutorials and lectures and they were perfect in all scenarios. I thought I might be a little disappointed because these weren't the higher end Px8 version but I honestly can say that I am so impressed with these that I can't imagine needing the Px8. Call clarity was also excellent so these check off all of my most wanted and needed things in a great pair of headphones. These come with a nice sized sturdy case to house the headphones and the included cords (the case is the same color as the headphones). I would definitely recommend giving these a try.""]"

I bought these because my last pair of wireless headphones broke on me in the middle of Zoom Uni. So, I decided to splurge and they have a nice base, so music is fun to listen too. I can hear everyone when I have class, meetings, or workshops. They are just very uncomfortable the cushion is actually too plush it just squishes all the way down and you can feel the hard framework behind it. I wear glasses and since it is so snug if I don't adjust my glasses I will have deep indents of my glasses on my head. They are also not comfortable to wear with a mask. Overall this $200+ purchase is probably not my favorite. I wish I could find comfier headphones that won't break on me in a year, but for now I'll have to suffice with these. *Also sorry for the bad photo, my hair is messy since I have to put it up for work, but the red frame is my glasses, and I'm wearing my mask.""]"

"Apple AirPods 4 Wireless Earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, USB-C Charging Case, Wireless Charging, H2 Chip",$318.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/apple-airpods-4-wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-adaptive-audio-transparency-mode-personalized-spatial-audio-usb-c-charging-case-wireless-charging-h2-chip/18896043/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My full on detailed review after 3 days of use. Okay, first things first, ANC is solid for what the buds are and without the eartip. It has no issues knocking an aircon out of the room or the buzzing of a refrigerator. Positives: This may be apples SMALLEST available package of any electronics. The case itself is probably the smallest case ever released onto the open market, which makes it easily portably in a bag, a pocket, or a purse. This is also in my opinion, the BEST case on the market for these reasons. These buds are COMFORTABLE so long as they fit. I had my girlfriend try these and she said they weren’t great, but I can happily wear these for their entire battery life with no ear fatigue. Finally, these have the best transparency mode of any buds I’ve ever tried (I’ve owned 8 or 9 wireless buds at this point in my life) and it honestly feels like I’m not wearing anything. Negatives: For what these buds are, they’re overpriced for sure. These should be about $150 max. The buds themselves only have 4 hour battery lives, which means if you’re someone who wears buds at work or some other public environment, you’re gonna have to charge em at some point. ANC isn’t great, if you’re in a noisy area, you’re gonna have to turn your music or media up quite a lot to actually drown the noise out. This IS to be expected but it’s still a bit of a downside (still the best “open ear” ANC on the market though). Overall I’d give these an 8/10. They sound pretty good as all airpods have, they’re well built, and they provide a strong package. Personally, I like them more than the AirPods Pro 2 but these are overpriced. If you’re debating on these or the pros 2 and don’t care about price, get the Pros 2, but if you’re looking for a good set of buds WITH AN APPLE DEVICE while also trying to save a buck, these are a great choice. (Pics below conpared to Airpods Pro 2 and Samsung Buds Pro 2)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] And amazing product best fit so far amazing sound quality it makes a good present and is worth the upgrade', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these for myself as a Christmas Gift and I absolutely love them.

The sound quality is perfect — deep bass, clear highs, and an overall immersive experience. Whether you’re listening to music or taking calls, the sound remains excellent even in noisy environments. The noise cancellation works well, and I’d give it a solid 4 out of 5. It blocks out most background noise effectively, but there’s still a bit of room for improvement. The Transparency Mode is also very useful for staying aware of your surroundings without having to remove the earbuds. The charging case is fantastic! The battery lasts up to 10 hours of continuous use, which is great for a full day of listening. The case provides several additional charges, making it perfect for long trips. I also want to highlight the build quality. The plastic feels sturdy and premium, and the sleek design looks great. They fit comfortably in my ears and stay in place even during long listening sessions.

The case is able to be charged with USB-C. The earbuds came with a lot of different size options for the tips which made me hopeful I would be able to find a size that fit my smaller ears. I downloaded the app which I found to be nice looking and easy to navigate. It allowed for a lot of customization like an equalizer setting and choosing what different taps on the headphones do. The app even walked me through a fit check to figure out which tips would work best for my ears. I found the headphones easy to pair with multiple devices (they can pair with up to three devices which was nice - other headphones I've owned only allowed for two device pairings. I found the noise cancellation quality to be good for earbuds and the battery life was impressive. Not so good: A few times, when I paired them, it seemed like there was a delay in pairing both of the earbuds at the same time which was just annoying. I did not find these to be as comfortable as other similar audio products I have used in the past. Even the smallest tips were too large. I have smaller ear canals so if this isn't an issue for you, they may work well! In terms of sound quality, I was disappointed in the bass. It wasn't powerful and I couldn't hear lower frequencies very well even when using the equalizer to increase the bass. Overall, I would give these 3/5 stars.

And the mic. is clear and there's difference ways if you way your voice to sound but all in all it's a great amazing gaming headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are hands-down, my favorite gaming headphones. Bluetooth and compatible with just about everything.I say just about because Microsoft just keeps getting the short end of the stick when it comes to bluetooth tech, In the Xbox side of things, that is. Now PC? That\'s a totally different story. These things work seemlessly on my gaming RIG. I can use the dongle or just simply sync them via the aforementioned bluetooth technology. I\'m sure I\'ve said ""bluetooth"" like a 100 times already. They connect to the Nintendo switch with no problems and PS5? Too easy. The 2023 version simply knocked it out of the park with mic\'s sound quality and these are no different, if not better. With a 70 hour(projected battery life, these things could go throughout your work-day and still be ready for an all-nighter, gaming session. Yes. They can link-up to you phone or tablet. How crazy is that? The only rl problem I have with these is the packaging. Only because I\'ve always been a huge fan of green, and that\'s Razer\'s normal color scheme. But this particular box is something standard to a Playstation packaging. Like I said. Minor.They take no time to chargeand you can get a couple of good hours of gaming in on just a quick charge. They are so light, that yyou would think you were wearing a budget pair of headphones, but the build quality is a major go. The 50 mm drivers just baby the era lobes and I wear glasses and there\'s no problems there. I forget they\'re evven on sometimes, since I don\'t have to take them off to go get refreshments mid session. This was easiest 5 out of 5 I\'ve ever given. And thy don\'t coome often for me. The pricetag is more than adequate for such high-end tech. These things hard to beat. The charging cable couldbe longer, but that\'s not even a complaint, given how long they last.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is the ultimate wireless headset designed for console play. This version is for PlayStation and there is another version for Xbox, oh and you can get it in black or white, either way this headset delivers crystal clear audio with advanced noise isolation plus and all day comfort. Let me briefly explain what I like about this amazing headset. About the Razer HyperClear Super Wideband Mic: The detachable 3.5mm mic captures an unbelievable amount of detail of my voice and it ensures clear communication with my team while gaming. The Razer TriForce Titanium 50 mm Drivers provide clear and powerful sound, best of all I can individually tune for highs, mids, and lows. They deliver brighter and clearer audio with richer highs and more powerful bass without being overwhelming. As for the Razer HyperSpeed Wireless Technology: I do enjoy the high performance, low latency competitive play with perfectly synced sound thanks to the 2.4GHz wireless connection, flawless. And talking about the connectivity, they can be connected via using the wireless dongle as well as Bluetooth so I can connect the set to my phone, laptop or other devices. The Pro Tuned FPS Audio Profiles: Endorsed by esports pros, these on headset audio profiles provide maximum positional sound information for the ultimate competitive edge.

They have plush padding in breathable fabric that ensures comfort during long gaming sessions. Awesome Battery Life: A single full charge provides up to 70 hours of battery life on a single charge, so no down time and plenty of nonstop fun. Overall, they are crystal clear; they have amazing noise isolation, super comfortable for a long period use and best of all awesome battery life, ready to play nonstop.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TL:DR - Easily one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever tried. It’s compatible with PC, Bluetooth devices, and obviously PS5. It says it’s compatible with the Switch too, but don’t have one to try, but the PS5 is where I think it shines! I love the voice assistant letting me know some things like which EQ I’m using, and the sound is also really good! Easy recommendation. Spacial separation is really good! ---- Unboxing this device was a standard affair. Comes with your typical Razer stickers which is appreciated! Throw those on a water bottle for fun. But the real shine of this headset is how light weight and comfortable it is. It feels a little too light sometimes like you’re gonna bend the tiny little metal wire that is holding the headset cup in place to your head. I don’t like how flimsy it feels. The adapter is also L shaped so it doesn’t cover the other USB port on your PS5 which I really appreciate. But depending on your PC, it could be a problem. For me it covers either my power button or USB port and throwing it in the back is a non-starter for me! Luckily for me my intent is to use this with my PS5 and that’s where I think it shines. It prioritizes connectivity with the USB port on your PS5, so if you have it paired to your phone it will choose that over your phone which is good. It’d be super inconvenient to have to turn off BT just to play a PS5 game because chances are your phone is with you even when you’re planning on playing a game. The app I thought would annoy me, but NO account needed. Just download, pair the headsets to the app and blammo you’re ready to go! I paired it with my phone and had a phone call with my wife, the power button answers and hangs up phone calls which is nice. Just remember to unmute, she got annoyed with me pretty quickly before I realized I had mute on. Phone calls the mic sounds good, during gameplay my friends thought I sounded great! I love the base, and I seriously can’t get over the comfort! Razer did a phenomenal job with comfort. I took a day off to spend a day gaming and this thing is a battery champion! It seriously lasts SO long. I got through most of the day on a single charge. Playing from morning to early evening! Charging it however left some to be desired. It wasn’t fast. Anyway I had a lot of fun with this headset and didn’t get ear fatigue. Seriously that alone is worth high praise! The awesome sound, good mic, and platform versatility is just icing on the cake! Needless to say, I’m a fan and will get another for the Playstation 6 if it’s a thing.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So I\'ve been gaming with the Razer Blackshark V2 Pro headset for the past week or so, and I\'ve been pretty impressed. Are they perfect? No, but they are an excellent value. Build Quality : Is excellent and although I thought about giving these a 4 star rating, the build quality of this headset made me raise it to a 5 star rating and recommendation. The earfuls are made of a very strong plastic. They do not creak or feel cheap. They feel tough while remaining lightweight. The padding is soft but I wish it was a little more comfortable. They behave like memory foam but the pads aren\'t very thick and after a while my ears become a little fatigued. But I use it as a reminder to take a break, take the headset off and stretch and walk around a bit. The headband feels and smells like leather. It\'s probably faux leather, but it sure feels nice. There is a volume know on the left ear cup which makes volume adjustment quick and easy. There is also a microphone mute button next to the power button. On the right side there is a button that allows you to goggle between 4 audio presets. ""Custom"" , ""Music "" , ""Games"" , and ""Movies"". The presets sound great and I haven\'t felt the need to tweak the custom sound too much. I\'ve enjoyed watching movies with these just as much as I\'ve enjoyed gaming with them. The microphone is very impressive, it is a high quality microphone. My friends all said my voice came through loud and clear in our game chats. I don\'t know if I would use it exclusively to stream with, but in a pinch.. I think it is perfectly fine for live streaming and game commenting / recording. As far as gaming headsets go, these are amongst the best I\'ve tested and gamed with recently. Explosions are booming, guns thud loudly. Voices sound crisp and music also sounds impressive. They do have that digital sounding ""explosive crunch"" when playing games with lots of explosions and gunfire in your surroundings. It is probably a software thing though, caused by the video games I play or the consoles I game on. The dongle is an odd shape but it plugs into the front of the PS5 and pairs automatically and seamlessly. The dongle will also work with a PC and the Nintendo switch. My only real complaint with these headphones are that my ears get tired when using these for long sessions. Your mileage may vary though! The cups could use a thicker memory foam pad. Would I recommend this headset? For sure! I know competition is very fierce in the gaming headset space, but I think this headset is an excellent value. They are compatible with PC, PS5 and Nintendo switch. They have 50mm drivers and a Wideband microphone. They sound great and battery life is awesome. If these are on your shortlist, check them out!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are an amazing headset for gaming! They are lightweight and have very soft ear pads that allow you to use them for a longer amount of time. The combination of form-fitting pads and breathable material provides the most comfortable headset to wear. The mic is a good size and adjustable. The sound quality is amazing and they also have great noise canceling ability. The range is on point as well! They are very well made and durable. Hands down the best headset we have ever had! Absolutely great product!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] design/ features - unboxing the razer blackshark v2 pro is fairly simple the design is literally I dentical on last year blackshark v2 pro but this time on console for ps5/ XSX support what I have the for the PS5 and PC support I happen to have both, the design finish of the headset is beautiful love the traditional razer black color it also doesn’t scream gamer headset so I do appreciate that a lot. very light headset with one major volume nob on the left side and small remaining power button/ sync button, preset and mute button all on the headset. we also have razer latest hyper clean super wide band microphone. with titanium 50mm drivers. comfort - razer blackshark v2 pro is equipped with with ultra soft memory foam, they do feel great when you feel them for the first wrapping around your ear is very comfortable this gaming headset is way more comfortable than my beats headset when it comes to ear comfort. at the top of the headset you also have memory on upper portion of your head. was hoping the ear covers are removable but nope. you won’t be able to replace it in the future. it’s stay cool from gaming on long session this definitely one of the most comfortable headset i’ve ever tried audio quality - when it comes to audio quality im not quite sure how I feel. not sure if razer technology actually does something different that you can hear. plugging with the PS5 god of war. and The Finals I didn’t have any issue recognizing certain small audio queue. fishing my self adjusting a bit more than I would think or what i was used to. i’ve tried all the stock preset it offer right from the get go and I just always leave it on game mode. the headset offer great audio quality and was a joy to listen to. I ask my friends if the voice quality sounded good which they responded yes it’s good and clear. good job razer I think you guys offer a great microphone with this one. connectivity - after testing on PS5 decided to play and test it on PC this time playing the new release Gray Zone Warfare. one issue that i’m still currently having with this headset is the connectivity for Razer own synapse to recognize the blackshark v2 pro. my pc have the latest firmware version and double check but this the first razer product that would not show up on synapse. I couldn’t create any custom EQ so that was frustrating. I’m guessing this console version/ PC doesn’t support it? overall I just connected the headset using the dongle and it just connected flawlessly battery - battery hours razer claim blackshark v2 pro offers 70 hrs of game play. I made sure to fully charge the product first before gaming. overall throughout the time I tested it I didn’t have to charge the headset so far. also I didn’t get to burn 70 hrs on this maybe 40 hrs max and still going strong. conclusion - I love razer products I have a good amount of accessories from keyboard/ mouse blackshark v2 pro is a great comfortable headset memory foam help a lot and the weight of the product I love how someone this headset look. the audio sounded great with 50mm drivers that immersive you. the issue with connecting to synapse was a little disappointing. I even tested and downloaded razer utility app to show up but no success. overall it’s still a solid headset for console user and pc gamers out there. I still recommend this but if you’re a pc gamer and want that extra feature might wanna test it and see maybe it’s only my headset issue. feel like I missed out on some features that I could have tap into', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ---Unboxing / Setup--- The Razer BlackSharrk V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset for PS5 is a very simple product to get up and running. Inside the box Razer includes the headset itself, detachable mic, a USB-C 2.4hz wireless receiver and a small USB-A to USB-C cable, presumable intended for charging. That\'s it. To setup and use the headset on a PS5 you simply need to plug in the USB-C wireless receiver into the front of the PS5 USB-C port, power on the headset by pressing the button on the left ear cup, listen for the human recorded voice that says ""power on"" and that\'s it. If you have your PS5 set to not autodetect between audio inputs,. you\'ll need to go into the audio settings and select ""headset"" as the output preference. Otherwise, you\'re off to the races. On the Switch, the experience is more or less similar. Plug in the wireless receiver, ensure audio output is switched to headset and you\'re off to the races. On PC, it\'s a mostly straight forward affair with a couple things to note: Since this headset is PS5 ""specific"" there is no Razer Synapse support on PC. The audio is controlled strictly from Windows itself. Plugging in the wireless receiver into a USB-C port allows Windows to show up as ""BolackShard V2 Pro PS 2.4"" in the sound settings panel. Click on that and make sure you select ""Windows Sonic for Headphones"" under the ""Spatial sound"" setting in order to get the most from this headset. The headband is easy to adjust for proper sizing, Simply moving the cups up or down on the slider until things fit snug was easy. I found the distance between smallest to largest was excellent and will accommodate just about any head size. --Performance-- Sound is very good on all 2 platforms. Things sound best with Playstation\'s 3D spatial audio which this headset has specific support for. Sony has done an amazing job with this technology and the Razer headset was excellent as reproducing immersive directional sound. It was very easy to tell foot step direction, explosion direction, etc. when playing any game that supports ""home theatre"" or ""spatial audio"" affects. PC things weren\'t too shabby either, Windows Sonic for Headphones does a pretty decent job at directional audio too. I found it wasn\'t as immersive and accurate as the PS5, but it still allowed for the ability to sense where a competitor was coming. It\'s worth noting that the BlackShark V2 Pro also supports Windows Sonic natively. The Nintendo Switch was also good, though the least exciting of the 3. Directional audio worked to a point, but I find the soundstage of the Switch to be a bit more ""flat\' than the PS5 or the PC. This isn\'t the headsets fault thought and a limitation of Switch hardware and that there is no specific spatial audio tech that this headset supports for the Switch specifically. Sounds was overall good. This headset tends to favor mids and highs the most. Sound is sharp and detailed. I found this headset lacked a low end frequency and things that should go ""BOOM"" were a bit flattened out. Sound was also much harsher on the PS5 than the PC or switch which went a little more ""warm"". I expect this is due to this being a very PS5 specific headset with the other 2 simply being ""plug and play"" options. Overall, sounds was great from a gaming perspective, but I would not want to watch movies or listen to music with this headset. The detachable mic is a nice addition and it can be removed when not in use. Mic picks up vocals very well and I got good feedback from friends while chatting with them in game. There is also a button on the left ear cup to mute the mic input. There is also a volume adjustment dial on the left ear cup for easy volume adjustment. On the right ear cup is a ""mode"" button that cycles between various sound EQ modes, such as game, movie, etc. I didn\'t find each EQ setting to offer a substantial difference over the next, though game was more sharp and punchy while movie offered a little more low end frequency, but not much. The headset is very light weight and I did not notice any fatigue while wearing it. It was very comfortable as well. The ear cups are cloth material, so they may cause you to swear a bit if you run hot. They were breathable enough not to bother me at all and my head remained very comfortable. So far I\'ve used these for a total of 8 hour and have not had to charge them once. I\'m not sure how long battery actually lasts, but so far it seems stellar. There are no RGB lighting or noise cancellation on these headphones. They\'re just basic, easy to use, decently sounding headphones aimed at core gamers who don\'t need any non-essential features. This is overall a solid headset and if you simply want a good sounding pair of gaming headphones with no fuss setup, this is certainly one to consider. I appreciate the folks at Razer allowing me to review the BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset for PS5. I will enjoy getting much use out of these across my multiple platforms!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the Best quality, Comfortable, Clear sound headset I have used. They are very comfortable on ears and head, the memory foam padding is soft & good quality. Its light weight. They fit very well and do not cause discomfort after using even for longer period, I used about 5 hours continuous. Sound is very crisp and clear I can hear each sound clearly and can differentiate the sound of everything. Mic performance is good, and it is detachable. The volume knob on the side is also very convenient. Battery life is good. It has noise cancellation effect; while playing I don’t like to be disturbed and this headset fairly cancels surrounding/external noises. No doubt this is my favorite among others. Love playing games wearing this headset. I have done meetings with it as well. One drawback, the foam padding is not replaceable, so better take care and keep it clean. This headset enhanced my gaming joy a lot. The clear sound quality plus the comfort of this headset is worth the price.']"
Technics EAHAZ80EK True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds – Black – 2023 Model,$248,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/technics-eahaz80ek-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-black-2023-model/17162988/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am absolutely blown away by the Technics AZ80 earbuds! I’ve owned several wireless earphones from different brands, but these surpassed all my expectations. The fit is incredible—they sit perfectly in my ears, feel secure even during intense gym workouts, and have no annoying stems that can be accidentally knocked out. They're compact and look sleek, especially in smaller, feminine ears. The sound quality is phenomenal, with clear tones across all frequencies, and phone calls are crystal-clear on both ends. The app is a game-changer—it allows me to customize the noise-canceling to either block distractions or let in ambient sounds when needed. It’s ideal for staying aware of my surroundings when I want to. Most importantly, they’re so comfortable that I forget I’m even wearing them! No discomfort, no slipping—just pure audio bliss. The only downside? My husband keeps borrowing them because he loves them just as much as I do! Highly recommended for anyone looking for the perfect mix of quality, comfort, and style."", 'These earbuds provide a truly exceptional listening experience. The crisp, immersive sound quality, featuring deep bass and clear highs, beautifully enhances any genre of music. The noise-canceling function effectively minimizes distractions, promoting focused listening during calls or music enjoyment. 🎼🎧💯 I found them comfortable even during extended use, and the blue finish contributed to a sophisticated, modern aesthetic. The battery life is quite impressive, providing many hours of use on a single charge. 👍🔋🎧 If you desire premium wireless earbuds that offer superior sound and style, these are an excellent option. 💯', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like these earbuds. I often have problems with earbuds falling out of my ears when I’m active. The Technics - Premium HiFi True Wireless Earbuds with Noise Cancelling earbuds do NOT fall out nor do they move positions in my ear. They are so comfortable. They do NOT make my ear itch like some earbuds do. I must really have strange ear canals as I seem to require a different size earbud pads in each ear. These earbuds come with a total of 14 pads so it was easy to find the ones that not only fit comfortable but also worked well with the noise canceling benefit. I wish the light that tells if they are fully charged stayed on when I open the lid of the charging case. There are two lights that come on immediately upon opening but one goes off in just a few seconds. I have to look quick. The case and the earbuds are easy to charge with the enclosed (very short) cord. It does not come with a charging block but m phone charging block worked perfectly. The case is light enough that I can just leave it hanging in mid-air when charging without any problems. The sound is amazing both when talking on phone or listening to music/podcasts. So far it has been water resistant as I wear it when I sweat and in light rain showers. Being a gal my shoulder length hair does protect them some from sweat and rain. These are perfect for wearing when I’m cleaning and don’t have my phone on me. The company says the Maximum Wireless Range 33 feet but I have no idea. So far I have had no problems with cutting out or disconnecting when my phone is in an other room. I am well pleased with these top of the line earbuds. They were easy to set up and sync with my phone using the free APP. Oh yeah and they come with a manual which is rare these days. I did need a magnifying glass to read it though.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Panasonic Technics is a premium tier audio brand. These are one of the newest earbuds in the market and wow, they have blown my expectations away. The price is a bit on the higher side, but the earbuds do come with some premium features many other flagship headphones do not have and to an extent, justifies the price. In this review, I will explain my thoughts on the Panasonic Technics. *TLDR at the bottom ============================================== IN THE BOX/FIT: In the box, you get the earbuds in a sleek matte black case. The top has a brushed metal feel and has the Technics logo in gold. The earbuds themselves also contain a similar look with the brushed metal and Technics logo on the top. While I like how the earbuds feel, I would have preferred completely black earbuds without the logo. The logo is nice touch, but I do like more of a low-key look rather than a logo plastered on top which screams “look at me.” There are also extra ear tips, a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and some documentation. These are comfortable earbuds. On a scale from 1-10, I would place these at a solid 10. These are up there with some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tested. There have been times where I have had these in my ears for a couple of hours and no discomfort was ever felt. Another plus is that these don’t fall out of your ears easily when moving around. It is rare to find earbuds that fit perfectly in your ear, and these are one of them. If you do get these, I recommend playing around with the different sized ear tips to find the “perfect” fit. I also like how both the headphones and case have some material where fingerprints won’t be an issue. ============================================== SOUND QUALITY: In terms of sound, these earbuds sound amazing. If your phone has an option for Dolby Atmos or LDAC, I certainly recommend you enable the setting. Music, movies, podcasts sound 100% better when these modes are enabled. Lows, mids, and highs are all balanced and not one overpowers the other. I’m a bass head with certain genres of music but I do listen to some genres where bass isn’t the biggest focus and having a balanced sound is preferred. These earbuds allow for just that: balance! ============================================== AUDIO CONNECT APP/OTHER FEATURES: While the Audio Connect app is optional, I do recommend it since it will unlock many features that can enhance your listening experience. Some of the features that can be accessed within the app are EQ settings, switching between ambient and noise cancelling modes, renaming headphones, enabling LDAC, and more! These earbuds can be connected to three devices at the same time which is certainly impressive. Switching between devices was seamless and no issues arose. An underrated feature is the call quality. I have used these for work calls, and they do sound fantastic. No complaints in the call quality area! ============================================== POSSIBLE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT: An area where I thought these earbuds could be improved upon is the noise cancelling feature. The Technics don’t have the best NC for premium earbuds. I have tested out cheaper earbuds with slightly better NC than these. Nevertheless, the feature is still good, but I did notice more sound being allowed through with the Technics compared to others. Another area is the case. These earbuds are considered “premium”, but I felt the case did not get that same love that the earbuds did. I have tried out a myriad of earbuds and the plastic case for the Technics have the same quality and feel that some of the cheaper brands have. $300 is a lot for earbuds so as a consumer it would be nice to get your money’s worth. ============================================== CONCLUSION/TLDR: Overall, these are an excellent pair of premium earbuds. You will be getting your hard-earned money’s worth with these for the most part. There were some minor features that could have been better but honestly, I know many will enjoy having and using these. If you are someone who is looking for premium earbuds with plenty of great features like multipoint connection, LDAC, and wireless charging, these Technics by Panasonic are a perfect choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Earbuds are sometimes tricky when it comes to getting super noise canceling, however I must say these definitely did not disappoint. They're super easy to connect to your phone, music is 10/10 and it made it easy to go places without any kind of disturbances. Battery life seem to be pretty good since using them I didn't need to charge them right away after a few uses and let me not forget to mentioned they're pretty cute in Blue. Definitely will have to get others on to these because they're pretty worth it especially when you want to hear only what's going on in your ears."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excited to have been able to receive these wireless earbuds to give my most honest opinion. I love that it gives you multiple sizes of the ear pieces so that you are able to select the size for your comfort. The sound quality is so clear and the noise canceling is so each to manage. It was easy to use regarding the taps to adjust the volume of answer a phone calls. The ability for them to snuggle right into the ear is definitely one of the best ear wireless ear buds I'd ever worn. You can get them in a variety of different colors of your liking. 10 out of 10 recommend."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It\'s been years since I\'ve come across the Technics brand. I remember them as making really high end receivers years ago when I was growing up. So I was very surprised to see the brand name resurface with these earbuds. And boy did they get it right. These are hands down the best earbuds I\'ve ever used, from comfort, to features, to sound. Everything about them is perfect. First, the most important attribute of earbuds, sound. The sound is so crisp, everything I listened to, from Nina Simone to the National sounded like I was hearing the music anew. The lows and highs all hit the perfect pitch. Not to mention these earbuds have the most fully customizable sound via the app so you can tune it to how you like it. Second, these buds have a very comfortable fit. They come with an arsenal of different sized tips, so there is likely a size for everyone. They stick in you ear with a little twist, and I\'ve never felt like they loosened over time. Third, they look great. The case and the outside of the earbuds have a milled finish, giving them a very high end appearance. Fourth, the app is the best I\'ve seen. Everything is fully customizable, from the sound to the amount of ambient noise you want to let through. And last but not least, these are the only earbuds I\'ve used that allows me to connect to multiple devices. I\'ve owned multiple pairs of earbuds that have been rendered useless because the pairing function eventually breaks down from constantly pairing and unpairing. I have these paired to my phone and laptop and I never have to worry. The only flaw I\'ve found so far is the very annoying voice that says ""connected"" 2-4 (maybe 6 if you have 3 devices connected) times (once for each earbud and once for each device) every time you put them in your ear. Some sort of ding would suffice, and I haven\'t found a way to turn the voice off. The only other improvement I would make to these is to support some of the new 3D sound formats, like Dolby Atmos, but they sound so good as they are it wouldn\'t be a dealbreaker for me. Highly recommend!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent audio quality with rich bass and crisp trebles. Sound can be further adjusted with a 5 band equalizer (as well as several presets) in the accompanying app. There's an LDAC mode, which further improves the dynamic range if your device supports it. Active noise cancelling is quite good, although it doesn't completely block out ambient sound (I could still hear the quiet whirring of my bathroom fan, which I would've thought would be completely eliminated, considering it's essentially white noise). There's also a sound transparency feature which can be helpful for people who want to be more aware of sounds around them while they're listening to media, but I always find this feature to sound odd and unnatural. Multipoint connection works smoothly -- I tested it on my Pixel 7 Pro and Pixelbook, and the connection worked fine between the two. You can connect up to 3 devices, but LDAC can't be used in that situation. Fit is excellent. My initial concern with the shape was that it would be bulky and uncomfortable, but it felt great even after an hour of uninterrupted use. Panasonic thoughtfully included 5 different earbud sizes/shapes as opposed to the usual 3 (but the ones that came preinstalled were perfect for me). Touch sensor buttons work fine, and it's nice that you can customize them using the app, since the factory defaults don't make complete sense to me. Mic quality is the main weak spot. I tested making phone calls, and even from a quiet environment, my wife noted that my voice was distorted and choppy. I also tested by making a call to my own office voicemail and playing it back. My wife's Pixel Buds A are far superior in terms of mic quality (and those were 1/3 the cost of these earbuds). Build quality is excellent. The earbuds and the case are made of sleek metal with a nice matte texture that won't attract fingerprints. The case also supports wireless charging. Overall, these earbuds are terrific for listening, but not great for phone calls, which is why I'm docking one star (and if you use your earbuds a lot for calls, I'd dock two stars). Considering the pretty high price (more than both the AirPods Pro and the Pixel Buds Pro), I would expect superior quality in all respects, not just audio."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TLDR: I’ve been fortunate to be able to test headphones from nearly every manufacturer. These rank as one of the best I’ve tried. INITIAL SET-UP The Technics app is very simple to understand and straightforward. I tried it on both my iPad and my Samsung Galaxy phone. The app performed flawlessly on either device. That can’t often be said for some other vendors, so Technics deserves kudos for doing a great job of making an app easy to use and functional on various platforms. USE I tested the new Technics earbuds with nearly every music genre imaginable. I tried a bunch of different music styles: Rap, Rock, Classic Rock, Hair Metal, New Country, Classic Country, Beethoven, Bach, Hip-Hop, Oldies. You name it, all courtesy of Amazon Music in HD or better. These Technics nailed it. Their music reproduction and clarity rivals ANY of the other manufacturers I’ve tried. Mids and highs are transparent and energetic. The built-in amps never felt strained or overburdened, even during loud passages. These are one of the only headphones or earbuds I’ve tried that made me stop multi-tasking just to listen to them. Their effortless mids and highs are crystal clear with no hint of muddiness. Vocals are clean and crisp and quite honestly, these ear buds offer some of the best detail and clarity I’ve ever experienced. Movies were impressive, but this is where the Technics gave up some of their magic. Yes, vocals and audio were pristine and easy to understand. But they were so clean that they did give up some of the immersion I get from Technics competitors. The movie soundstage was just not as immersive and enveloping as other products on the market. Active Noise Cancellation has proven to be very good. Easily drowning out ambient noise around my office and home. Technics claims 7.5 hours of battery life per charge, and I found that to be about right. Listening to music, often at loud levels, I lost about 20% battery life in around 1.5hrs. Not bad at all considering the volume at which I was listening at and using ANC. The provided carrying case allows for up to 25 hours of use before a full recharge is needed. NEGATIVES The only real fault I can find is in the bass response. Technics lists the overall frequency response as 40Hz to 20kHz. That leaves some on the bottom end that is untapped and unobtainable. This is the one time that Technics’ competition makes up some of the ground they have lost to these excellent buds. CONCLUSIONS There really isn’t anything not to like about these ear buds. Technics has produced an excellent product. A product that is so crisp and detailed, it caught me off guard when I first tried them on. All the latest tech specs are there too: Bluetooth 5.3, ANC, Multi-Device Pairing, LDAC support, Hi-Res Audio Support, Wireless charging. At the end of the day, do the Technics have what it takes to take over the top spot in my current headphone and ear bud selection? The answer is YES. While other buds or headphones do movies better, NONE of my others have the detail and clarity in the mids and highs that the Technics provide. There are some products that deserve the praise, some that don’t. The Technics AZ80’s in one product that deserves the high praise. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Received these for free to test out! I was super excited to try these out. I’ve used them a couple days now and I think they’re great! My only complaint is that they are a little bulky looking. I like that you’re able to customize the sound to your liking and that they have many different sizes for the ear plugs or whatever you call it. Ensuring a comfortable fit! I am not sure if I would be willing to pay retail price for these as there’s so many options out there. I also have tried using them for a phone call and there is definitely a learning curve I feel. If they weren’t bulky I would like them a lot more']"

I refuse to pay $400 for a pair of headphones and this one has all the functions I needed with the noise cancelling and the bigger ear coverage.

Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Xbox Wireless Gaming Headset - Black,$249.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/razer-blackshark-v2-pro-xbox-wireless-gaming-headset-black/17857913/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox by Razer has once again pushed the boundaries of what gamers can expect from high-quality audio peripherals. This headset is a game-changer, especially in terms of its EQ settings which are impressively immersive. The 'Movie' setting is my favorite, enveloping you in cinematic soundscapes, while the 'Call of Duty' setting optimizes audio cues crucial for gaming, and surprisingly, it even enhances the music in games like Rocket League. One of the headset’s standout features is its weight balance. It’s light enough for long gaming sessions extending into the night, yet has a heft that reassures you of its quality. The sound quality is phenomenal, whether you're deep into a gaming session or enjoying your favorite films, these headphones deliver outstanding audio performance. However, one area that could use improvement is the mobile app compatibility, or any app capability. Currently, the mobile app supports only the PS5 version, leaving Xbox users without an app for settings adjustments. An update to include Xbox compatibility would make this excellent product even more versatile, mobile or PC. In the app they have every headset they make it seems, so I have no doubt they will add this headset to the lineup eventually. Comfort is paramount with this headset. The ear cups are soft and cozy, and the headband design allows for hours of comfortable use without any strain or discomfort. The low latency performance, thanks to its 2.4 GHz connection, is impeccable. In fast-paced games like Call of Duty, where every millisecond counts, this headset ensures that latency never hampers your play. Battery life is another significant advantage. I haven't needed to charge the headset since unboxing, and after about 15 hours of use, it's still going strong. This endurance is perfect for gamers who dislike frequent recharging interruptions. What comes in the box? The headset, the 2.4 GHz dongle, 2 cables – one USB-A to USB-C (male), one USB-A to USB-C (female), documentation, Mic boom. The female USB-C is to plug in the 2.4 GHz dongle to make it closer to the gamer to lower latency (its so good! It works!) In conclusion, the BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox is an outstanding product that stands tall among competitors. While the lack of mobile app support for Xbox is a minor snag, the overall performance from sound quality to comfort and battery life is exceptional. Razer continues to impress with its innovative and quality gaming products, making this headset a must-have for serious gamers."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Blackshark V2 Pro headset by Razer takes gaming to new, wonderful heights. It’s comfortable to wear, sounds excellent and offers plenty of customizability. I’ve been using this headset with my Xbox Series X for a couple of days, and I have to admit, it’s the best headset I’ve ever owned. It’s easy to get started with the headset, as all you have to do is plug it into the Xbox with the wireless dongle with the USB-C to USB-A cable. If you want to get the most out of this headset, you can download the Razer Audio Setup app. This allows you to change the EQ (different presets + custom), microphone EQ, mic input monitoring and other headset settings such as creating a profile and how soon you want the headset to turn itself off after inactivity. You can change the EQ presets on the headset, but all the mic related options seem to be exclusive to the app. The standard EQ profiles sound great. The profiles are game, movie, music and custom. The custom profile has to be adjusted in the app, but allows full flexibility. All the profiles offer a rich frequency range, so it really comes down to preference. The “game” option will serve you well for most games, but you might prefer the other ones, if you’re watching Netflix or listening to Spotify. This headset can also be used with your phone, either via Bluetooth or 3.5 mm cable. You can even answer calls with the headset power button. In addition to the standard EQ profiles, there’s the Esports EQ profiles. They’re specifically made for Apex Legends, Fortnite and Call of Duty. Call of Duty was noticeably quieter (more dynamic range, perhaps?) with scooped mids, while Fortnite seemed louder with more mid range. Apex Legends seemed to offer the more balanced option overall. There’s another custom option here (so a total of two). You can adjust any preset, but changing the frequencies can be glitchy. The mic EQ profiles is a wonderful addition, but the differences are subtle. I love being able to adjust my mic monitoring, since this headset does isolate a lot of background noise, including my own voice. My friend said the mic sounded very good through an Xbox party, that it was almost like listening to a podcast. My only comment is that I could definitely hear my own breathing, when keeping the mic as directed (1.5 - 3 cm away from my mouth). The mic is detachable, in case you just wanna relax with a movie on the train or get tired of blaming your teammates in Warzone! After wearing the headset for hours, it still felt very comfortable, so this is clearly designed for long gaming sessions. It also “automatically” adjusts to your head, unlike most headsets that are annoying to adjust. The volume control is “reversed”, so you turn it up by turning the knob counter-clockwise. It syncs with the headset volume in the Xbox audio settings, but the mic monitoring is greyed out there, so you’ll have to use the app for that. The headset is also compatible with PC. If you’re planning on using it wirelessly, flick the slider to USB on the wireless dongle. No 3.5 mm cable is included, but if you have one lying around, you can use this headset with pretty much any device. A 20” USB-C to USB-A cable is included for charging. There’s also some Razer stickers included and a helpful manual. The battery life is roughly 70 hours on PC, 48 hours on Xbox. The Blackshark V2 Pro Headset is an excellent headset for those who’re looking to take their gaming to the next level. Great sound and comfort, mixed with unparalleled customizability and compatibility. Like gamers like to say… let’s go!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Deep in the cavernous confines of the earcups of these headphones, lie the tortured cries of the vanquished foes from your latest game. Through the pop-filtered, connectorized, microphone, come the grunts and victory-seeking shotcalls to your comrades-in-arms as well as the scorns directed to the enemies of your efforts. So, maybe it’s not all drama all the time. But it could be, as sound can really influence your communications and degree of immersion and involvement in whatever you are doing while wearing these fine cans. There used to be a bit on SNL and Wayne’s World a long time ago that used the quote, “We’re not worthy, we’re not worthy” and certainly these gaming headphones elicit those feelings from an amateur gamer such as myself. But who among us can’t appreciate a headphone’s 70 hours of battery life, or the large, all-day comfortable fit that make it an obvious choice of esport pros? What’s in the box? Well, wrapped inside the pretty tissue paper ensconcing the shiny, dark exterior of the slick box, lay the foam cutouts that clutch the comfortably-resting headphones. The supporting roles include the microphone, with its position-sensitive connector, the USB-C dongle that allows use of the headphones with Razer’s HyperSpeed wireless connection with an Xbox or a device with a USB connection (via a selector switch), the charging cable with USB-C to USB-A connectors and finally, an adapter cable with a female USB-C connector to a USB-A connector. The controls are interesting, as there are a few twists and turns involved, such as the multi-purposed rotary control knob that most obviously controls the headset volume, but also controls the game/chat balance. There are also controls for microphone muting, power and selecting the equalization presets. There are selectable eq profiles for “Game”, “Movie”, “Music”, and “Custom”. Within the “Game” settings are some game-specific profiles for Apex Legends, Call of Duty and Fortnite. The “Movie” setting’s sound is characterized by some very low bass, “Music” has a pretty neutral balance (minus some low bass), “Game” is a bit restricted sounding on both the highs and lows, and “Custom” is by its nature, variable. You can employ the Razer Audio Setup app to control these settings. HyperSpeed wireless is a feature-moniker of this headphone that describes the increased speed that the USB dongle-connected device allows compared to the slower Bluetooth connection, making it all the more possible to play or work via the fastest speed with these headphones. Pros and cons Just a few items were less than ideal. One is that the physical size of the cups combined with the externalized cup locating positioning rods are a bit uncomfortable against the upper chest/sternum and neck if positioned on the neck for taking a break to talk to a meal provider about dinner or trying to dissuade the fireman from separating you from your game for an “emergency”. I wish there was some sort of padding on the rods or a beveled surface on the ends. Also, I never realized that font sizes came in negative numbers as used in several locations on the instructional flyer. I think even babies with their young eyes would have trouble reading some of those tiny, 1/32” tall characters. The sound for me was very good with only the higher frequencies a bit lacking when compared to high-end, high-fidelity headphones. The silver lining to that minor cloud is that the fatigue factor will be much lower for all-day use as a result. Also, the microphone sound was reported as being clear and well-articulated. I think that the maker is perhaps not taking full advantage of the versatility of these headphones by advocating (limiting?) their use for only gaming. I understand that that is the primary designed purpose, but as you start using these, you will find yourself widening your utilization in ways you hadn’t anticipated. Tellingly, I had a hard time reviewing these headphones due to family members constantly wanting to use them!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve had the privilege of being a BestBuy Tech Insider for the past year and a half and seen my fair share of tech gadgets (specifically, headphones). The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset stands out for its reliability and natural spatiality performance. Here’s a breakdown of my experience with it: Comfort: I wore these headphones for a two-hour gaming session without feeling any discomfort. The headband is designed to be roomy so they don’t squeeze your head. Also, the cushion material is breathable and lightweight which is great at preventing sweat and fatigue. They’re perfect for long sessions, whether you’re gaming or watching movies. Audio Quality: The sound quality is quiet impressive. It has bass but remains clear, without the muddiness or tininess that some headsets have. I tested them with Red Dead Redemption 2 and Gears 5. In Game mode, footsteps and environmental details were much more prominent, which added to the immersion. Movie mode, on the other hand, was incredible with Red Dead Redemption 2. The audio mix in that game is excellent, but with these headphones, it was a whole new level. I could hear birds, mud splashing, and bandoliers clinking with stunning clarity. I used the ""Detailed"" Dolby Atmos preset, which worked perfectly. However, I did try to see how DTS:X for Headphones would fare, but unfortunately, it didn’t show up on the app’s headphones preset list. Another standout feature is the seamless panning. Typically, if action transpires to the right of a playable character, the audio jumps to the left ears when turning to find your target. Many headphones that purport to be 7.1 surround sounds still present a stereo soundstage. When you move your camera 360 degrees in-game with the Razer Black Shark, the sound transitions smoothly from left to right. This is rare in most headphones and really impressed me Connectivity: Setting up Bluetooth was straightforward. I’ve been using the dongle to switch between PC and Xbox, and it works seamlessly. The various esports modes are handy, offering optimized settings for games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty (settings labeled as such). The microphone, although a bit large, is effective. I appreciated the lack of audio feedback, which can be distracting during live chats on Xbox. My only minor issue is with the dongle. I would have preferred a USB connection since the Xbox Series X doesn’t have a USB-C input. However, it works great with my gaming laptop. Battery Life: I\'ve had them for a little over a week, and they have been holding up great without a single charge. To be fair, I have only had a total of 4 hours usage between gaming and movies. I do have more testing to do, so I will refrain from giving a comprehensive review on battery longevity. However as it stands, it\'s pretty satisfying. Overall, the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is a reliable and premium choice for gamers who need high-quality audio, excellent atmosphere and comfort for extended use. Highly recommend these!! 4.75/5', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound quality on these is amazing. The headphones cancel out all the other noise around me. The microphone only picks up my voice. It doesn't pick up people around me talking. I love how comfortable these fit. I can wear them while playing for hours without bothering my ears. They charge up fast with the included cable. I like that I can control the volume and hear everything clear. These last for up to 70 hours of game play time before I need to charge so I don't have to worry about them going off in the middle of my game. I love the fact that they can be used with both my consoles and my PC. They fit comfortably and the microphone can be detached when I am not using it. They also connect right away with no issues. They are definitely worth it because they fit good and have good sound quality"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Omg! these are so amazing!

These have a great battery life, they are adjustable. Connecting was easy to all platforms.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Razer has been producing high quality gaming accessories for years and I have had good experiences with them, from gaming mice to headsets. This wireless headset is designed for XBOX but can also be used to connect to other devices with the included USB dongle. Pros: - I loved how easy set-up was. Everything connected and worked automatically. The dongle has a switch to toggle (XBOX or USB). I just had to make sure it was set to XBOX, plug it in using a USB adapter, turn on the headset, and my XBOX notified me that the headset was assigned to my account within seconds. - The volume control knob was a great design choice. Prior headsets I have used had multiple buttons to increase or decrease volume. The knob made it much easier to quickly get the volume settings exactly how I wanted them. - With gaming headsets, comfort might be the most important factor considering how many gamers like to embark on long gaming sessions. I was very pleased with the design of the Blackshark V2 Pro, as I was able to wear it for several hours without any discomfort. It's not heavy and the headband and ear cups felt great. - Battery life is incredible. After almost a week of use, I never had to recharge it once. It's rated to last 48 hours on XBOX and 70 hours on PC. Cons: - Connecting the mic to the mic port felt like had to apply more force than I wanted to. I'd prefer that be designed a little better as I was worried I might break it while inserting it. This is a terrific headset for gamers. I used it mostly for gaming, but also used it to watch some movies and stream some shows. The audio quality was incredible and gives you a whole new dynamic as you can hear every little thing, making games, movies, and TV shows far more immersive. I highly recommend this latest Razer model.""]"

You can change your party volume and game volume on the headset.

It made me want to buy more games after so many years."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am really enjoying these LucidSound LS15X headphones so far. Have used them multiple times on my Xbox One playing Call of Duty and also Fifa. Good sound quality and plenty of settings to adjust the volume, equalizer, and chat/gameplay mix, and mute/unmute all from the headset itself. No need to go into the system settings. Love the wireless feature compared to my last wired set. Was easy to set up. Literally just plugged in the USB adapter into the back of my Xbox and the headphones synced up. The guys I was playing with said the mic sounded good and it hasn't cut out on me at all. The microphone is fairly sensitive, so I did have to make sure it wasn't too close to my mouth. Easy to charge as well, just plug into micro USB charger. Comfortable on the head too. Loving these so far!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I did enjoy this headset at first. It was easy to get it connected because it is wireless. I personally love wireless headsets over wired. You have no wire at all getting in the way so you have free range of motion. I play video games (and so does my son) for hours a day. The charge holds up really good for us. It lasted 3 days without being charged again. The only thing is, the sound isn't the best. It does seem to be muffled and go out at times. So these are decent if you just need a back up pair."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've bought so many different headsets for my son to use on his Xbox. He can find fault in just about everything. But after picking this headset I had very high hopes that maybe this one would be a winner. First off, he absolutely loved that this one is wireless. He said, mom come listen to the sound!! So I did and wow!! The sound was amazing. Crystal clear with no static. He is super happy with this headset and I have stopped my search for the perfect one because this one is it! Awesome headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We have tried so many brands of headphones for Xbox and our Nintendo switches and they have either died in the first month or did not meet our needs. We are a family of 4 and all are gamers and finding headphones that meets everyone’s needs is really hard. First the Luvidsound is very comfortable and well made. Sound quality is amazing along with the duel mics make it easier to play with friends or just listen to in game sound. I love that it has a detachable mic but also a built in mic so we don’t have to have the detachable mic to talk. The ease of use is great as well. With just a click you can mute your mic or sound and you can twist for volume which makes it easier than finding a button. We bought 1 for each of us to use and can’t wait to see what other products LucidSound comes up with.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son is an avid gamer, so when he received these headphones he was pretty excited to be able to break free from cords and still interact with his buddies. He said the charge lasts about 3-4 days based on how frequently he plays. He’s been very excited about the quality of the sound and even his friends say he’s crystal clear. He has been recommending these to all his friends, so I’ll say this is a hit!']"

Studio, Solo 2, Solo 3, the beats earbuds, you name it, failed wires, broken ear pads, ripped ear pads, failed drivers on one or both sides left or right, ( drivers are the little speakers where the music you enjoy is coming through) Apple bought the brand and failed again and again to improve the quality of these headphones or earbuds. The colors also fade on some of the plastic areas of the band, discoloration from poor quality materials, cheap plastic. I have been using BOSE and Sennheiser headphones, notice that BOSE is written in all upper caps, they deserve all the credit and it’s an amazing brand.(disclosure: I am not being paid to advertise any product here, I am just being straightforward.)

It is also more compact and attractive than ear-mounted earphones. Even if you don't listen to the song, you can look at it as a fashion item.

Bose QuietComfort Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - White Smoke,$329.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-white-smoke/17212848/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After spending some time with these headphones, I can confidently say they are my absolute favorite. They are very comfortable for long-term use. They fit completely over my ears, so I experience zero fatigue. The ear pads and the headrest pad are insanely soft. These are perfect for long sessions at your desk or listening to music on the go. I work so much at my desk with work, school, and then video games; these are a perfect all-around fit. The all-day battery actually lasts all day long. I've noticed they also hold a charge really well. I left them at 70%, and two days later, when I turned them back on, they were still at 70%. They connected seamlessly to my iPhone. If you have the battery level widget on, these will display their battery level along with your other connected devices, which I love. Of course, they will work with Android as well. I recommend downloading the Bose Music app to have the best possible experience with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top tier. They do a great job of blocking out any unwanted noise. The carrying case they come with is great quality, and it comes with a little pouch where you can store the charger and the included 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm audio cable. There's also a small tag in the case that guides you on how to fold your headphones so that they fit in the case perfectly. I love these headphones! They're my new daily driver."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve been listening to music, podcasts, and watching movies with these Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over The Ear Headphones for the past week and I am smitten with them. They have become my go to / primary dedicated headphones for listening. They are very comfortable for extended listening sessions. I\'ve fallen asleep with them on, I am a side sleeper and they don\'t bother my ears. I don\'t fall asleep with headphones on often lol, but the couple times I have.. they did not bother my ears or sleep. Once I woke up with them on the floor, so I guess I knocked them off my head and they did not take any damage. Build quality is excellent, I wouldn\'t snooze with them everyday or just toss them in a bag without the case though. The headband is quite strong and sturdy. I gave it the old twist / flex test and it doesn\'t creak at all or feel like it will break. The headband is actually a little flexible. I own quite a few sets of headphones and earbuds ( I won\'t mention brand names) But These Bose Quiet Comfort are quite possibly the best sounding headsets I\'ve ever owned. My music library touches just about every genre, and it all sounds amazing with these headphones. I like to use the bass booster setting in the Bose app because I like to feel the bass a little, but I leave mids and treble at 0 and every note is loud and crispy clear. The bass does not completely overpower everything else but you can still feel the bass thumping on your temple a little.I think Bose has re-established themselves as the best in sound quality with these. I smile every time I hear a little note or sound I missed / didn\'t notice before with other headphones before. You definitely will not be disappointed with them. Battery life is excellent but they do take a lil while to charge. So I would recommend topping them off when they get between 20-40% if you plan on being away from a plug for a while. The right ear cup has volume controls, charging port and the power slider. The left ear cup has an AUX port and a button to toggle between ""quiet and aware"" modes. Would I recommend these headphones? For sure! I love them and would gladly buy another pair if I need to replace them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first Bose headphones, but I’ve used plenty of headsets that boasted many features including multi device and noise cancelling. But I have to say that Bose has mastered the science of the noise cancelling headset, creating the QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones. This is one of the best headsets I have ever used, even for just blocking out background noise to find a little peace and quiet. Pros - Easy setup and use. - Amazing noise cancellation. - Perfect for on the go. Cons - Fit takes time to get used to. - EQ settings are rather basic. Out of the box, which includes a travel case, USB C, and audio cable with inline Mic, the initial setup is extremely simple. Literally, Bose has made it so you can use the QuiteComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear headphones without needing the app out of the box. But the app does enable added features that make the experience better when used together with the headset. I was able to pair the QuiteComfort right out of the box without any issue. Within minutes I was on a call through my phone without any issues. All you must do is put the Bose QuiteComfort on, push and hold the power button past the on position until you hear the “pairing mode” cue, then select the Bose Headset from the list of available devices on your specific device. And Done. No downloads or annoying app setup is required. One of the best setup experiences I have ever had with a headset. I was able to easily pair the QuiteComfort with my work laptop, tablet, and even desktop computer without any additional downloads or issues. The multi-device connection allows for 2 devices to be connected at the same time, which is super convenient if you want to take a call while being connected into another device. The buttons to control the headset are well placed on the headset but the multi-function button on the Right earcup will take a bit getting used to as there are multiple commands on one button: 1 press is Play or Pause or Answer or End a phone call, 2 presses is Skip Forward, 3 presses is Skip Backward, and a Press and Hold will decline a call. While the left button can be customized to open a selected app or perform a set task with a single press or act as a Mute button if pressed 2 times while on a call. Overall, the buttons feel responsive and easy to find while wearing the headset. The build quality is great, high-quality plastic is used but it feels solid and doesn’t give or flex during use. Both ear cups can rotate and extend down to be adjusted to fit better on the head. A USB-C plug is available on the bottom of the Right earcup for power and a 3.5mm audio jack is available on the bottom of the Left earcup for use with an audio cable. The sound is crisp and clean, no matter which device I connected to the sound came in clear. The call quality was amazing! I had multiple comments on how clear my voice was heard even with background noise going on, I lucked out and got these the same week my neighbor had their main sewer line replaced. I was able to confirm that both the mic and audio noise cancelling work quite well, even being just across the street the background noise never broke through the call to be louder than the voice or audio. That’s not to say they couldn’t hear the background noise, but my voice was still very clear and understandable. If you need a headset to use in a loud environment, that will keep your audio and voice clear, the Bose QuietComfort is a great choice. The Noise cancellation had more settings than most, allowing for a sliding selection of sensitivity for the filtering of background noise. There are different modes that can be cycled through using the Left action button, by default there are 2 modes: Quiet and Aware. The “Aware” mode is helpful if you want to reduce the overall noise and look like you are listening to music but be fully aware of your surroundings. This brings me to my only initial complaint about the headset, which was that initially the headphones gave me a bit of a squeezed or suctioned feeling when I put them on. This is due to the passive noise cancelling of the earphone cushions, which create a tight seal with the head to keep out extra noise. This was something I had to get used to before I could enjoy the headphones to their fullest. If you have any sensitivity to your ears or inner ears, these headphones may take time for you to adjust. The added EQ settings really do make a difference but are limited to just a few “adjustments” but should cover most user’s needs, though if you’re used to a ton of pre-settings, there are only 4: Bass Boost, Bas Reducer, Treble Boost, and Treble Reducer. It’s basic, but for my uses it works as I’ll adjust most of my audio on the source side. Overall, I’d suggest the Bose QuietComfort headphones to anyone looking for a premium audio experience that needs noise canceling and multi-device connectivity. The Bose QuietComfort will reduce or cancel out a moderately noisy background like the office or public transportation while providing great sound and audio performance. The noise cancelling on the mic is quite amazing, keeping the voice quality clear even in extremely noisy environments. Though these are premium headphones, they are a perfect example of the saying, “You get what you pay for”. The Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones are a great product for anyone on the go who wants a great experience from their headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bose has always been known to make high-quality products that sound great, so I was extremely excited to try out the new QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling headphones. While I have been impressed with the build quality, nice sound, and high tech features, there are just a few things that keep these from being a “perfect” set of headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones ship in a sleek box, and included along with the headphones are a hard-sided carrying case, a USB-C charging cable, a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable with an inline microphone, as well as warranty information. Inside the package is a QR code that will send you to the Bose Music app that is used to control the settings on the headphones. Downloading was simple, and my headphones were paired in a matter of seconds after I had finished charging them up. The Bose Music app really comes in handy when using the QuietComfort headphones, as it allows for customization options that aren't accessible by any other means. I appreciated that you can easily switch from “Aware” mode, which pumps in the ambient sound around you, and “Quiet” mode, which is noise cancelling. You can also create a custom mode that blends the two, with a slider used to dial in how much noise cancelling you want (or none at all). Unfortunately, there is no option to just use the headphones in Bluetooth mode with neither Aware or Quiet turned off; one or the other (or a combo) must always be activated. I found that the sound while in Aware mode was actually not that intrusive when it came to amplifying the sounds happening in the outside world around me. Basically, it did not sound overly harsh or synthetic that I was being fed in the ambient noise by the headphones mic system. Noise cancelling is also very good on these headphones, probably the best I’ve ever heard. While the QuietComfort headphones use fancy technology to achieve these results, it helps that the headset cancels out a fair amount of noise just by putting them over your ears. With the noise cancelling off, I noticed that I already had a hard time hearing the people around me; once the noise cancelling is turned on, it’s very much as if you’re in your own private world. I haven’t had a chance to use these on an airplane, but I’d imagine they would be excellent at negating some of the annoying noises found on most flights. Now here’s where we get to my first problem with the Bose QuietComfort headphones. The seal around your ears that is responsible for that awesome reduction in ambient noise, is also something that I’ve found I can only tolerate for small amounts of time. The sense of pressure on my ears is so noticeable, that it reminds me of in-ear earbuds and why I have a very hard time wearing those types of headphones. I thought that maybe it was only when the Quiet mode was on, but this sensation was persistent throughout my testing, and occurred even when the headphones were turned off and being used with a cable. The first day I had these, I wore them for about a total of 5 hours, and tried to ignore the feeling in my ears. Over the course of that night and the next day, I had a headache and my ears felt like I had been listening to music at full blast. I recognize that this is something that affects everyone differently, and that some people likely won’t notice this at all. However, I thought I should mention it, in case someone (like me) is very sensitive to headphones that create a strong seal on their ears. The upside is that aside from that sensation (for me), these are some of the most comfortable headphones I’ve ever worn. The headband is soft and padded, and the super squishy earpads are large and completely go around your ears. The inside of the cups is also deep enough that I never noticed my ears touching the drivers or the sides of the cup. Each side is adjustable using sliders that extend plenty far enough for my big head, with room to spare. On to the sound. (For testing, I used an iPhone 13, a MacBook Pro, and an Xbox controller with a 3.5 mm headphone jack). The sound profile of these headphones is very different when in Bluetooth, versus playing with the included cable. On a Bluetooth connection, the sound slightly emphasizes the bass, and the mids and treble sound defined, and thankfully the highs are also not too harsh. What is strange, is that if you push the volume past about 70 percent, the bass starts to artificially roll off as you approach 100 percent. I imagine that this is done to lessen the chances of blowing out the speakers (?), but what's interesting is that when played with the audio cable (no Bluetooth), you can push the volume to the max and easily tell that these headphones can handle it, no problem. While I don't listen to things at full blast all the time, I like knowing that I can raise the volume, and every facet of the sound will follow along. The artificial bass cutoff with Bluetooth turned on is so noticeable, and I honestly have no idea why they implemented it. Additionally, the QuietComfort headphones get LOUD in Bluetooth mode, but once again, with the dimmed-down bass at the top of the volume range, I saw no reason to push it to 100 percent. Audio quality with the included cable is like a totally different headphone. When playing music with the cable, the QuietComforts sound incredibly neutral, with bass that borders on anemic at times. Thankfully, the actual tone of the sound range is great, with tons of detail in the mids and highs, with genres like rock, country, and classical sounding pretty amazing with the power off. I do wish that the bass was more pronounced, but it can show itself in some more bass-heavy tracks found in hip-hop and electronic music. Overall, the audio cable sound was impressive, even if I wish there was just a touch more bass. As for the cable, this is definitely a weak point of the Bose QuietComfort headphones. While it has a mic (that works fine for phone calls), it is incredibly thin and flimsy feeling. Additionally, I didn’t measure it but it barely made the length from my headphones to my side pants pocket where my phone was. It also does not have any inline controls, so you cannot change the volume, answer calls, press play/skip, etc. This feels like the absolute bare minimum Bose could have included with these headphones, and almost urges you to use them in Bluetooth mode. Other things I didn't cover: -There are buttons on the headphones, for volume and controlling tracks/answering phone calls. These can’t be used when running the headphones via the cable (I tried). -There is another button used to switch between modes, or tell you the battery life (via a voice in the headset). -Battery life is rated at about 24 hours per charge, and I believe it. I haven’t timed exactly how long I’ve been using these in Bluetooth, but the charge lasts a very long time. -Cable charging is done with USB-C, so that is a plus! Although the included cable is so short I’m not sure how useful it is. -The Bose Music app lets you adjust the EQ of the headphones, which is nice, though I’m not much on using EQs on my phone to begin with. -Build quality is great, these headphones feel sturdy enough to hold up for the long haul, and all of the materials used feel great in the hand. Overall, I believe that Bose has created a great set of noise-cancelling headphones, with only a few downsides. I do think Bose could make improvements when it comes to being able to use Bluetooth without Quiet or Aware mode; no artificial bass cutoff in Bluetooth mode; and a better audio cable. If you’re looking for exceptional noise cancelling with good sound quality, and don’t mind the few issues I noted, the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones should definitely be on the top of your list!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these for my birthday and I really enjoy them.

The ear pads are pretty plushy and create quite a tight seal for very good noise cancelling. The headband is flexible with a good amount of tension (as to not move/shift), so these headphones should fit comfortably for many different people.

However, on occasion, I will come across a product that warrants a review, whether it is positive or negative. With that being said, I am pleased to say this is one of my most positive reviews for a product, ever. I have struggled to find well-equipped, high-quality, ACTUAL noise-cancelling, over-the-ear headphones for so long due to my indecisive nature and lack of knowledge on what brand/type/cost is best for me. I usually struggle to the point of just giving up on choosing the best ones, I end up sticking with my ancient, slowly dying AirPods at the end of the day. That is not the case for this situation. I was so exhausted of using AirPods that don’t work half of the time and truthfully, the battery life was becoming non-existent without being on its charger. So, when I saw these Bose headphones went on sale at BestBuy, I sprung into action. I’ve used them consistently each day for about 2 months now. Switching over to these headphones has been an absolute game changer for me and my hectic daily schedule, as I am graduating veterinary school this May. The noise-cancelling power is wild! For example, a person could literally be screaming loudly behind me, and I would not hear even a peep, especially when I put them at the highest noise-cancelling setting. One of my favorite parts about these headphones is the ability to drown out any noise around me so I can focus on my paperwork, read, and study study study. I have always had an inability to stay on task since I was a child, and this annoying quirk resonates as trouble focusing and quieting my thoughts on to one solitary task/project at a time. These headphones have kicked my lack of attentiveness to the curb, and I now feel like I could get anything done with these magic little guys on my ears. The cool feature of these is the various noise modes that you can set them at depending on your needs or preferences in different settings. The modes include quiet (best noise-cancelling effect mode), aware (less noise-cancelling for better awareness of surroundings), music, home, relax, focus, commute (e.g., bus, train, airplane), workout, running, walking, working, and lastly, outdoor mode. You can easily switch between four different modes consecutively just by pushing the button that is conveniently on the backside of the left cuff. The left-sided button can be pressed and held down to readily access your shortcuts, such as Spotify or current battery level. It can also be used to mute a phone call, if needed, by pressing the respective left cuff button twice. There are three identical buttons on the outer portion of the right cuff that are used for: —> increasing/decreasing the volume —> pausing/playing the media (tap once on middle button) —> skipping to the next songs/episodes/etc. (tap twice on the middle button) —> tracking backwards to the previous song/episode/etc. (tap three times on the middle button) —> answering/declining phone calls Not to mention, these headphones hold a battery life like no freaking other. I have had them for two months and I have charged them fully ONCE? Like how does it do that? Nonetheless, I am obsessed with everything about my Bose headphones, starting with the aesthetically-pleasing minimalistic color, shape, weight, and comfortability they carry. Putting them on is like putting soft little sand-colored clouds on your ears. Feels like God himself could have crafted these bad boys when I wear them! Additionally, the headphones connect to a Bose app on your phone so you can adjust your listening preferences, bluetooth device connect-ability, and a multitude of other little intricacies that are extremely simple to navigate and change at any time you like. I am no Bose expert or product review specialist by any means, but I feel as though these deserve five stars for the impact they have made on my daily life! Bose products have become my Roman Empire. Thank you for listening and taking the time to read this. I hope my review will not cause you to have tunnel vision in what products are great vs others. Everyone has their own opinions, needs, and preferences, and I would hate for you to not love them as much as I love them. Overall, I hope that this review helps you decide what YOU want out of your next high-quality headphones purchase! Take care, and happy headphone hunting :)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these about a month ago as a gifts so far I really like them. The only complaint I have is that the noise cancellation is not as solid as I hoped but its still better than the headphones I used to use. They are super comfortable to wear though. I am a college student and I study for 4-6 hours aat a time I can wear them the entire time without being uncomfortable. Highly recommend. Super comfortable, cute, and easy to use! Wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4.0 stars.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had my headphones since the end of November I believe and the times I’ve used it have been maybe not over 6 times because I use my AirPods, and so usage has been very minimal and they haven’t even left my house once , yet, they look broken and flimsy, it does not have sound cancellation and I can hear noise after I wear them, when I place a call and I have the tv on, I have to turn it off because people can’t hear me, I’ve had beats by DRE but I would not recommend these, at all..

Bose QuietComfort Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Triple Black,$329.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-triple-black/17212847/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After spending some time with these headphones, I can confidently say they are my absolute favorite. They are very comfortable for long-term use. They fit completely over my ears, so I experience zero fatigue. The ear pads and the headrest pad are insanely soft. These are perfect for long sessions at your desk or listening to music on the go. I work so much at my desk with work, school, and then video games; these are a perfect all-around fit. The all-day battery actually lasts all day long. I've noticed they also hold a charge really well. I left them at 70%, and two days later, when I turned them back on, they were still at 70%. They connected seamlessly to my iPhone. If you have the battery level widget on, these will display their battery level along with your other connected devices, which I love. Of course, they will work with Android as well. I recommend downloading the Bose Music app to have the best possible experience with these headphones. The noise cancellation is top tier. They do a great job of blocking out any unwanted noise. The carrying case they come with is great quality, and it comes with a little pouch where you can store the charger and the included 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm audio cable. There's also a small tag in the case that guides you on how to fold your headphones so that they fit in the case perfectly. I love these headphones! They're my new daily driver."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve been listening to music, podcasts, and watching movies with these Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over The Ear Headphones for the past week and I am smitten with them. They have become my go to / primary dedicated headphones for listening. They are very comfortable for extended listening sessions. I\'ve fallen asleep with them on, I am a side sleeper and they don\'t bother my ears. I don\'t fall asleep with headphones on often lol, but the couple times I have.. they did not bother my ears or sleep. Once I woke up with them on the floor, so I guess I knocked them off my head and they did not take any damage. Build quality is excellent, I wouldn\'t snooze with them everyday or just toss them in a bag without the case though. The headband is quite strong and sturdy. I gave it the old twist / flex test and it doesn\'t creak at all or feel like it will break. The headband is actually a little flexible. I own quite a few sets of headphones and earbuds ( I won\'t mention brand names) But These Bose Quiet Comfort are quite possibly the best sounding headsets I\'ve ever owned. My music library touches just about every genre, and it all sounds amazing with these headphones. I like to use the bass booster setting in the Bose app because I like to feel the bass a little, but I leave mids and treble at 0 and every note is loud and crispy clear. The bass does not completely overpower everything else but you can still feel the bass thumping on your temple a little.I think Bose has re-established themselves as the best in sound quality with these. I smile every time I hear a little note or sound I missed / didn\'t notice before with other headphones before. You definitely will not be disappointed with them. Battery life is excellent but they do take a lil while to charge. So I would recommend topping them off when they get between 20-40% if you plan on being away from a plug for a while. The right ear cup has volume controls, charging port and the power slider. The left ear cup has an AUX port and a button to toggle between ""quiet and aware"" modes. Would I recommend these headphones? For sure! I love them and would gladly buy another pair if I need to replace them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first Bose headphones, but I’ve used plenty of headsets that boasted many features including multi device and noise cancelling. But I have to say that Bose has mastered the science of the noise cancelling headset, creating the QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones. This is one of the best headsets I have ever used, even for just blocking out background noise to find a little peace and quiet. Pros - Easy setup and use. - Amazing noise cancellation. - Perfect for on the go. Cons - Fit takes time to get used to. - EQ settings are rather basic. Out of the box, which includes a travel case, USB C, and audio cable with inline Mic, the initial setup is extremely simple. Literally, Bose has made it so you can use the QuiteComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear headphones without needing the app out of the box. But the app does enable added features that make the experience better when used together with the headset. I was able to pair the QuiteComfort right out of the box without any issue. Within minutes I was on a call through my phone without any issues. All you must do is put the Bose QuiteComfort on, push and hold the power button past the on position until you hear the “pairing mode” cue, then select the Bose Headset from the list of available devices on your specific device. And Done. No downloads or annoying app setup is required. One of the best setup experiences I have ever had with a headset. I was able to easily pair the QuiteComfort with my work laptop, tablet, and even desktop computer without any additional downloads or issues. The multi-device connection allows for 2 devices to be connected at the same time, which is super convenient if you want to take a call while being connected into another device. The buttons to control the headset are well placed on the headset but the multi-function button on the Right earcup will take a bit getting used to as there are multiple commands on one button: 1 press is Play or Pause or Answer or End a phone call, 2 presses is Skip Forward, 3 presses is Skip Backward, and a Press and Hold will decline a call. While the left button can be customized to open a selected app or perform a set task with a single press or act as a Mute button if pressed 2 times while on a call. Overall, the buttons feel responsive and easy to find while wearing the headset. The build quality is great, high-quality plastic is used but it feels solid and doesn’t give or flex during use. Both ear cups can rotate and extend down to be adjusted to fit better on the head. A USB-C plug is available on the bottom of the Right earcup for power and a 3.5mm audio jack is available on the bottom of the Left earcup for use with an audio cable. The sound is crisp and clean, no matter which device I connected to the sound came in clear. The call quality was amazing! I had multiple comments on how clear my voice was heard even with background noise going on, I lucked out and got these the same week my neighbor had their main sewer line replaced. I was able to confirm that both the mic and audio noise cancelling work quite well, even being just across the street the background noise never broke through the call to be louder than the voice or audio. That’s not to say they couldn’t hear the background noise, but my voice was still very clear and understandable. If you need a headset to use in a loud environment, that will keep your audio and voice clear, the Bose QuietComfort is a great choice. The Noise cancellation had more settings than most, allowing for a sliding selection of sensitivity for the filtering of background noise. There are different modes that can be cycled through using the Left action button, by default there are 2 modes: Quiet and Aware. The “Aware” mode is helpful if you want to reduce the overall noise and look like you are listening to music but be fully aware of your surroundings. This brings me to my only initial complaint about the headset, which was that initially the headphones gave me a bit of a squeezed or suctioned feeling when I put them on. This is due to the passive noise cancelling of the earphone cushions, which create a tight seal with the head to keep out extra noise. This was something I had to get used to before I could enjoy the headphones to their fullest. If you have any sensitivity to your ears or inner ears, these headphones may take time for you to adjust. The added EQ settings really do make a difference but are limited to just a few “adjustments” but should cover most user’s needs, though if you’re used to a ton of pre-settings, there are only 4: Bass Boost, Bas Reducer, Treble Boost, and Treble Reducer. It’s basic, but for my uses it works as I’ll adjust most of my audio on the source side. Overall, I’d suggest the Bose QuietComfort headphones to anyone looking for a premium audio experience that needs noise canceling and multi-device connectivity. The Bose QuietComfort will reduce or cancel out a moderately noisy background like the office or public transportation while providing great sound and audio performance. The noise cancelling on the mic is quite amazing, keeping the voice quality clear even in extremely noisy environments. Though these are premium headphones, they are a perfect example of the saying, “You get what you pay for”. The Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones are a great product for anyone on the go who wants a great experience from their headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bose has always been known to make high-quality products that sound great, so I was extremely excited to try out the new QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling headphones. While I have been impressed with the build quality, nice sound, and high tech features, there are just a few things that keep these from being a “perfect” set of headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones ship in a sleek box, and included along with the headphones are a hard-sided carrying case, a USB-C charging cable, a 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable with an inline microphone, as well as warranty information. Inside the package is a QR code that will send you to the Bose Music app that is used to control the settings on the headphones. Downloading was simple, and my headphones were paired in a matter of seconds after I had finished charging them up. The Bose Music app really comes in handy when using the QuietComfort headphones, as it allows for customization options that aren't accessible by any other means. I appreciated that you can easily switch from “Aware” mode, which pumps in the ambient sound around you, and “Quiet” mode, which is noise cancelling. You can also create a custom mode that blends the two, with a slider used to dial in how much noise cancelling you want (or none at all). Unfortunately, there is no option to just use the headphones in Bluetooth mode with neither Aware or Quiet turned off; one or the other (or a combo) must always be activated. I found that the sound while in Aware mode was actually not that intrusive when it came to amplifying the sounds happening in the outside world around me. Basically, it did not sound overly harsh or synthetic that I was being fed in the ambient noise by the headphones mic system. Noise cancelling is also very good on these headphones, probably the best I’ve ever heard.

I have struggled to find well-equipped, high-quality, ACTUAL noise-cancelling, over-the-ear headphones for so long due to my indecisive nature and lack of knowledge on what brand/type/cost is best for me. I usually struggle to the point of just giving up on choosing the best ones, I end up sticking with my ancient, slowly dying AirPods at the end of the day. That is not the case for this situation. I was so exhausted of using AirPods that don’t work half of the time and truthfully, the battery life was becoming non-existent without being on its charger. So, when I saw these Bose headphones went on sale at BestBuy, I sprung into action. I’ve used them consistently each day for about 2 months now. Switching over to these headphones has been an absolute game changer for me and my hectic daily schedule, as I am graduating veterinary school this May. The noise-cancelling power is wild! For example, a person could literally be screaming loudly behind me, and I would not hear even a peep, especially when I put them at the highest noise-cancelling setting. One of my favorite parts about these headphones is the ability to drown out any noise around me so I can focus on my paperwork, read, and study study study. I have always had an inability to stay on task since I was a child, and this annoying quirk resonates as trouble focusing and quieting my thoughts on to one solitary task/project at a time. These headphones have kicked my lack of attentiveness to the curb, and I now feel like I could get anything done with these magic little guys on my ears. The cool feature of these is the various noise modes that you can set them at depending on your needs or preferences in different settings. The modes include quiet (best noise-cancelling effect mode), aware (less noise-cancelling for better awareness of surroundings), music, home, relax, focus, commute (e.g., bus, train, airplane), workout, running, walking, working, and lastly, outdoor mode. You can easily switch between four different modes consecutively just by pushing the button that is conveniently on the backside of the left cuff. The left-sided button can be pressed and held down to readily access your shortcuts, such as Spotify or current battery level. It can also be used to mute a phone call, if needed, by pressing the respective left cuff button twice. There are three identical buttons on the outer portion of the right cuff that are used for: —> increasing/decreasing the volume —> pausing/playing the media (tap once on middle button) —> skipping to the next songs/episodes/etc. (tap twice on the middle button) —> tracking backwards to the previous song/episode/etc. (tap three times on the middle button) —> answering/declining phone calls Not to mention, these headphones hold a battery life like no freaking other. I have had them for two months and I have charged them fully ONCE? Like how does it do that? Nonetheless, I am obsessed with everything about my Bose headphones, starting with the aesthetically-pleasing minimalistic color, shape, weight, and comfortability they carry. Putting them on is like putting soft little sand-colored clouds on your ears. Feels like God himself could have crafted these bad boys when I wear them! Additionally, the headphones connect to a Bose app on your phone so you can adjust your listening preferences, bluetooth device connect-ability, and a multitude of other little intricacies that are extremely simple to navigate and change at any time you like. I am no Bose expert or product review specialist by any means, but I feel as though these deserve five stars for the impact they have made on my daily life! Bose products have become my Roman Empire. Thank you for listening and taking the time to read this. I hope my review will not cause you to have tunnel vision in what products are great vs others. Everyone has their own opinions, needs, and preferences, and I would hate for you to not love them as much as I love them. Overall, I hope that this review helps you decide what YOU want out of your next high-quality headphones purchase! Take care, and happy headphone hunting :)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these about a month ago as a gifts so far I really like them. The only complaint I have is that the noise cancellation is not as solid as I hoped but its still better than the headphones I used to use. They are super comfortable to wear though. I am a college student and I study for 4-6 hours aat a time I can wear them the entire time without being uncomfortable. Highly recommend. Super comfortable, cute, and easy to use! Wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4.0 stars.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had my headphones since the end of November I believe and the times I’ve used it have been maybe not over 6 times because I use my AirPods, and so usage has been very minimal and they haven’t even left my house once , yet, they look broken and flimsy, it does not have sound cancellation and I can hear noise after I wear them, when I place a call and I have the tv on, I have to turn it off because people can’t hear me, I’ve had beats by DRE but I would not recommend these, at all.. I’m not expert but this is solely out of experience and people deserve to know from experience, I will be returning.']"

I'm in the Apple ecosystem and the Apple AirPod Pros do not stay in my ears while exercising or even walking. It's been a bummer. These Beat Fit Pros literally do everything I need and more and I'm shocked it took so long to buy-in. I underestimated how amazing the Spatial Audio feature is and having native Apple UI to view charge levels and adjust settings is awesome to finally have. Spotify has playlists specifically for Spatial Audio too! They connect quickly and I do not get a drop in connectivity or interference at all. On calls, my friends do not notice I'm using them and background noise cancelation is solid. The sound and bass is top-notch and rivals my Jabras (why I loved Jabra to begin with). The noise cancelation was a feature I really enjoyed on my last flight. While exercising, I can do burpees, sprints, jumps, etc. and they barely move. Not having wireless charging is a non-issue for me - they charge faster with USB-C anyway. GET THEM!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Been using this since I’ve purchased . And I love it!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Hey y\'all, I\'ve been using them for a few weeks now, and I really like them. They\'re one of the best wireless earbuds I\'ve ever used. I know what you\'re thinking: ""Those are just another AirPods"" But trust me, these AirPods are different. They\'re better. For starters, they sound amazing. The bass is deep and punchy, the highs are crisp and clear, and the mids are full and rich. I\'ve listened to all kinds of music on them, from classical to hip hop to rock, and they sound great with everything. The noise cancellation is also best in class. I can wear them in the car or at work, and I can barely hear the world around me. It\'s like having my own little sound bubble. And the battery life is insane. I can get a full day of use out of them on a single charge. And when I do need to top them up, the charging case is super fast. PROS: SOUND QUALITY IS FIRE. They deliver rich, detailed sound with excellent bass response. I\'m not an audiophile, but I know what sounds good, and these buds sound great. NOISE CANCELLATION IS NO JOKE. They block out a significant amount of ambient noise, making them ideal for listening to music or podcasts in noisy environments. I can wear them on the plane or at the gym without being disturbed by the noise around me. BATTERY LIFE IS ON POINT. They offer up to 6 hours of battery life on a single charge, which can be extended to up to 30 hours with the charging case. I\'ve never had them run out of battery on me, even when I\'m using them all day long. THEY\'RE COMFY AF(As Fancy ;) ;)). They are lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort. THEY\'RE EASY TO USE. They pair seamlessly with my iPhone and other Apple devices. I just open the case and put them in my ears, and they\'re ready to go. CONS: They\'re kinda EXPENSIVE, not gonna lie. The FIT can be FINICKY for some people. My ears get a lil sore after a while of wearing them. The BATTERY life is good, but it COULD BE BETTER. I\'ve had a few PROBLEMS WITH the NOISE CANCELLATION. It\'s not always perfect. CONCLUSION To wrap things up, I\'m really happy with this iteration of the AirPods. They\'re on the top of the food chain of the wireless earbuds, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great pair of earbuds. That\'s my two cents on the Apple AirPods.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The new design takes some getting used to. They're shorter than the originals but wider at the ear tips. At first they felt like they might fall out, but they've been secure even during runs. No ear tips means less ear fatigue for me, but your mileage may vary if you prefer a sealed fit. Spatial audio is neat but honestly not something I use often. It's cool for movies but I typically just want to listen to music without the fancy head tracking. The touch controls are a major upgrade from the original tap system. Squeezing the stem feels more intentional than tapping, and I've had fewer accidental pauses."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The third-generation AirPods deliver excellent sound quality with deep bass and clear highs. They are comfortable, with up to 6 hours of continuous use and MagSafe charging support. They are also sweat and water-resistant, making them great for workouts. While they lack noise cancellation like the AirPods Pro, their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem and overall comfort make them a solid choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so picky when I choose my pods. And always after a while use I found some issues with it but in this model, I couldn't find any issues. The feature they advertise was exactly what I got in these Airpods. I love to use it every day to help me more focus on my job with the sound quality you hear for music songs or even my favorite podcast.""]"

The setup is also a hassle, you have to download a few things and then you have to ask for a code from a representative that you can only get if you take off the earpads on the headset and send the numbers in, you also need two audio jacks to even operate them otherwise everything will sounds fuzzy and kinda muffled.

It is by far the best headphone on the market and is perfect for the outdoors ensuring you keep a piece of mind.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I work remote and I am on calls 80% of my day. This headset has saved me from headaches and not feel like I constantly have headphones on. They are light weight, the sound is awesome and the people on the other end cannot hear a thing in my background. I tested this to the max including running a vacuum. 100000% better than airpods or beats. The battery lasts me all day and I’m sure the next bit I always charge it at the end of the day. They also come with a hard shell protective case, high quality! I can easily swap fe my phone to my computer with a click, no more fighting with air pods with connecting to the wrong device and having to remove. I can’t say enough good things about my Shokz pro!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always had an issue with my headphones I would always have to buy the ones I go over your ear and I’m not really comfortable with that just because I have a piercing inside my ear. When I had the opportunity to listen to music close to my ear without the ability to damage my ear drums. I have used AirPods and with my piercing I had to move it and it ended up having a small soreness when I removed them. I tried the EarPods Pro and they never seemed to stay in my ears. It’s SUPER comfortable and has great sound quality and if you have a lot of base in your music it gives off a vibration on your sides and tickets a bit but it’s awesome. BEST purchase I’ve made with amazing battery life.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is an excellent product, especially if you are a runner or a cyclist; it is very light and comfortable; the only thing I will work on is the sound quality, and I will add more features, especially on the companion app', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love them, bought 2 pair, threw away my apple AirPods.

Very unique and comfortable design. I bought one of their earlier products many years ago for cycling and it was ok, used to feel some minor vibrations but this is a much improved product. This ""open-ear"" design is a game changer for outdoor activities, perfect for an audio book or music while you are outside. Also, I have started using them for phone calls at work and on the go, much more comfortable than airpods pro or similar products, which obviously go inside your ear. Love the case too. The sound volume levels might not be as good as in conventional headphones but these things are super useful for certain environments.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use these headphones for running. They're fantastic. I can still hear cars and people around me and still hear my music too! Charging is super quick and they stay charged for a long time. Extremely easy set up, connecting to my phone to play my music. I only rated sound as good, not excellent since I love to feel heavy bass when I jam out but it makes sense why these won't have the same effect as a Bose headphones. Overall, Extremely happy I got these! Highly recommend for people who like to listen to music and hear their surroundings too!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great for listening to music while also being able to hear what's going on around you. I also like to use it in the car because I can hear traffic while also being able to listen to something and and still be able to hear my kids in the back seat. Stays on your head while running or doing other exercise. Can get a little tight on your head. If you wear it for a long time and it can jiggle a little bit?

I always hung my headset over my lap until recently my lap broke and I no longer had a place to put my headset. Decided I was going to purchase a headset stand by Razer since I already own majority of their products. I like how it is pink and matches my headset and everything else pink that I own! I had a hard time deciding if I wanted the V1 or the V2, I came to the conclusion that I like the V2 better simply because it came with a 3.5mm headphone port and 2 USB 3.1 Superspeed ports so I can easily connect my phone or a usb drive without having to plug it directly into my PC. Overall, I think this is the best choice especially if you like pink (✿◠‿◠)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s so cute and it’s sturdy! I’ll always recommend razer', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Goes perfect with my daughters Razor Kitty Headset! RGB syncs perfectly in Chroma. Quality of stand is great, and USB charges well', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not sure how I missed it but this only works the way it is intended if it is permanently connected to your computer. At 0.9amps max if you are using a usb 3.1 port, it is agenizing trying to charge anything. One could bypass this by plugging it in to an external power supply but then you lose all function of the headphone jack and reduces the use of the usb ports to charge function only. Frankly, there are better options for the price for just a stand that can charge.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The software needed to control the base, Razer Synapse, is NOT compatible with Mac OS Big Sur. This is a known issue but Razer does not provide adequate support for Mac users. The software will no recognize your device, leaving you unable to control it in any way. Also: the device is a much more bright, ""bubblegum"" pink than is pictured. I like the product, but it is not worth paying a premium for a device on which you can\'t access the full functionality.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Base Station V2 Chroma is more than just a headset stand—it’s a must-have accessory for any gaming setup. The Quartz color looks stunning, and the Chroma RGB lighting adds the perfect aesthetic touch. Build & Design: Sturdy and well-balanced, securely holds my headset without tipping over. The Quartz finish is gorgeous, making it stand out in my setup. Compact design, so it doesn’t take up too much desk space. Features & Performance: Built-in USB 3.1 hub is super convenient for charging devices or plugging in accessories. 7.1 Surround Sound support enhances audio quality when using compatible Razer headsets. Chroma RGB is fully customizable, syncing perfectly with my other Razer gear. Final Thoughts: If you want a stylish and functional headset stand that doubles as a USB hub, the Razer Base Station V2 Chroma is a no-brainer. Highly recommend for any gamer or Razer fan!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Okay first off, yes I am a male and yes I love pink. My wife and son saw this and told me about it, so I had to go and check it out. I loved the look and it matches my Razer Quartz Kraken (with cat ears) and Blackwidow V3 keyboard. I love RGB (I am a child of the 90's, bright colors are rad) and it has a nice DAC built into it as well. 10/10 would recommend."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This item constantly loses power when connected to my PC. I thought it might just be drawing too much power through the USB port, so I bought an external USB hub with its own AC adapter, and the issue persisted. Also had the same issue with the Kraken Kitty Headset. Razer quality is slipping for sure. Probably best to skip this item for now.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this to take better care of my headset. I think this is great.

The sound quality is very good, the battery life lasts a very long time; sometimes I go days without needing to charge it. Dampens outside sound, you won’t hear a thing (from outside) when something is playing! The range of Bluetooth is pretty decent. Plugging the line in instead of turning them on produces a lower sound quality, but is still good. You can adjust the headphones overall volume separately from your phone volume but both work.

I recommend 100% and the price is a very good deal!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones work great. Unfortunately the design is cheap. Originally I thought they were going to last a while because the extender pieces are made of metal. However, the part around the actually ear pieces it just plastic... When i pulled them off my head, one ear piece just snapped off! This makes them completely unusable because they wont sit on your head. This seems like an extremely cheap way to not be able to use some very expensive headphones anymore. I am not happy. Yes, I've had them for 3 years now, but I will not accept this. I have other technology that is a lot more complicated that is 10 years old and works great still. For headphones to only last 3 years because they decided to make it with cheap plastic, is NOT acceptable."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love em! Very good sound quality.

So glad I bought them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The bass on the Skull Candy Crusher Wireless AKA by me as skullcrusher is great but the level of comfort is also great as well. Pros: great battery life, charge time is super fast, love the bass slider, big buttons, and bass is brain scrambling good. Cons: not very comfortable, earmuff pressed too hard(nearly compressing your head level), plastic part/sleeve on the earpiece where you adjusting the length of the headphone is a weak point(broke both of mine, two headphones). Holding mine together with a ziptie. Also, a clicking noise when pressed on one earpiece.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While these headphones have good sound, they have a gimmicky feature where you can artificially add additional bass to your music with a sliding switch. After using the bass boosting feature to many genres of music (pop, electronic, folk, metal, indie, rap) I can say that it is pretty useless. Pushing the slider past 1/3 of the way will distort the song heavily. The distortion ruins the music and I hate it.

It vibrates your head and in your ear canal. So you know it booming.Very loud Can’t hear no one even with the music half way on. So be aware of your surroundings. Tight fitting on head made well. Ear muffs way better then beats. The battery life insane. I charge it once a week and I’m straight. Cons wish it was fully black when you want to extend the headphones.

I needed something to help me focus, and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones are just what I needed. These are my first noise cancelling headphones and I'm very impressed. HARDWARE: The build quality is excellent. The headphones fit nicely in the compact case that is provided. A nice touch they added is an image inside the case to show you the proper position the headphones should go in the case. The headphones are comfortable to wear, from the ear cups, to the padding against your head. USABILITY: The headphones have two buttons, one for controlling the music and audio modes and the other for power and phone connectivity. It's easy to switch audio modes, pause, change tracks, etc. There is a virtual slider on the ear cup for changing the volume. I really like how easy it is to change the volume using that slider without having extra buttons. SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality is excellent. I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I can appreciate the sound quality is much better than the top tier ear buds I previously used. What I'm really impressed is with the noise cancellation. I didn't realize how much noise it would filter out. I tested it at work and the phone conversations were almost completely filtered out, whereas they used to drive me nuts. As i write this review I'm wearing the headphones so I can focus while my son is watching TV. FEATURES: The setup with the app was very easy and the app itself is great. By you have 3 modes configured by default: Quiet, Aware and Immersion. You can add or remove any that you want and you can customize the amount of noise cancelling, on a scale of 1-10. You can adjust the EQ using the app, I like to boost the bass. The only negative think about these headphones is the voice it uses for feedback, like telling you what device it's connected to or what mode you just switched to. It's just really horrible and hard to listen to. Fortunately you don't have to listen to it very often, but there are much better voice readers out there, so it's kind of disappointing. Ultimately, the voice doesn't affect the experience all that much. BOTTOM LINE: I am so glad I have these headphones when for when I go into the office, but I'll be using them for more than just noise cancellation. The audio quality is superior to anything I've had before, so I'll be reaching for these headphones next time I listen to music. I would definitely recommend these headphones."", ""I received my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in color: White Smoke and am very impressed by the sleek and stylish lightweight design with only two buttons: Multi-Function/Bluetooth buttons and a volume strip, where you can easily swipe up or down to adjust volume, all located on the right side of the earcup. The headphones are padded nicely around head and ears and provide exceptional comfort level after several hours of wear. I work from home and live in town where it can get pretty noisy during the day, so really needed a pair of good noise cancelling headphones to drown out the noise of the traffic and such. My favorite starred setting when working is Quiet Mode which provides exceptional Acoustic Noise Cancelling, and I found that my production increased due to being able to concentrate more on my work by not hearing all the distracting noises that entail with working from home. When I'm not working, I love to watch movies and listen to music with my Bose surround sound system, and glad that I can easily switch between devices and pair my new headphones with my sound bar as this especially helps when it's late at night and don't want to disturb or wake others. My favorite setting for movies and music is Immersion Mode which takes it to another level of complete bliss where the music literally wraps you up and sweeps you away! I'm so impressed with the quality of sound, it's so crisp and clean! The Bose app. is a must for set-up since there's no paper manual provided. There are so many cool features, tips, and shortcuts available in the app. to where you can customize your headphones to your liking and needs, such as the Equalizer (EQ) where you can add more or less Bass & Treble. I like that I can be listening to music and able to receive phone calls, which pause my song and then resume playing after my call. Very cool and convenient Sleep/Wake features, where the headphones automatically go into sleep mode when I take them off and then wake up when you put them on, and automatically powers off after 24hrs. of inactivity all while saving battery life. There are some things to be mindful of, such as the recommended safe handling suggests placing your hands around the middle of each earcup when removing from and putting back in case as this helps keep fingers away from the hinges, so they don't get pinched. It is also not recommended to use headphones near water or moisture of any kind and to clean with a dry cloth only! I knew that Bose would have the best pair of headphones available that would meet my needs and expectations and beyond, and they have always been my number one choice and have been very happy with all their products that I've purchased over the years. Bose also has exceptional and knowledgeable customer service agents to help with all your needs and concerns.

And I am truly honored to have this opportunity to review such a breakthrough product on so many levels. A true game changer. Phenomenal Sound Quality True immersion personified and I love being able to toggle between all three settings from immersion to quiet to awake and I love how when you take the QC ULTRAS off of your head they pause where you left off and start back playing where they were when you took them off when you place them back on your ears. Love how you can push the headset on and off so easily. This is hands down the most comfortable and sleekest headset I’ve ever owned and the performance I’ve ever owned and the performance and technological advances are out of this world combined with a simplistic yet sophisticated user friendly usability. If you want a head turning headset with stellar performance and daily use greatness than look no further than the QC ULTRAS. Cormfort is pillow soft to your ears to the point you don’t want to take them off in a good way. Ears aren’t encumbered in anyway. QC ULTRAS are a complete game changer and a must have for sound aficionados. QC ULTRAS gives you a front row seat why evolution is necessary in all facets of life if you are in the pursuit of true undeniable greatness… this headset is in my opinion epitomizes Bose’s exemplary sound quality and is their crowning achievement to date. Wore the QC ULTRAS for like two hours straight and felt like I never had anything on my ears at all even though I know for certain I did and since then I’ve worn them multiple times for even longer and feel like I could wear them 10 hours straight easy with little to no ear fatigue along with the lightness of the headset itself. Did a light workout with the QC ULTRAS and the performance was stellar and I felt zoned in on my workout in a real way but where the QC ULTRAS truly excel is in leisure and wearing walking around all day or laying down all day. The aware setting is out of this world game changing. I can hear the wind blowing, my portable electric air pump pumping my tire and I just had a full conversation in Walmart at Customer Service about electric cars and gasoline cars… the funny thing about it is the attendant was initially like you can’t even hear us can you sit and I was like these the new Bose QC ULTRAS so I can hear everything y’all saying… and to be able to say that out loud is a game changer in and of itself and was just unreal because I really could hear everything they were saying. It’s even clearer for me now after my third ownership of a Bose product why Bose is the best in the sound game in my opinion. I was able to talk to two people at once and fully engage with them in their conversation and add to it all while getting my customer service needs meet and all while still listening to music… Now that’s dope and something that a person like myself who highly values portability and versatility doesn’t take for granted.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Even though I have used some amazing wireless headphones before, and my personal bar is set very high, I was still absolutely blown away by how exceptional the performance of these headphones are. The noise canceling and sound quality are the best in their class. Bose Ultra is now the new standard for wireless noise canceling headphones, to which all others will be compared. Bose was one of the original pioneers of noise canceling technology, and they have made some excellent products over the years, but they have found a way to set the bar even higher with Bose Ultra. When wearing them, I feel like I am in my own personal bubble of sound. I was not able to test them on an airplane, but I am looking forward to using them the next time I fly. Sound quality is also excellent. They produce powerful, full-range, high fidelity sound that makes watching movies and listening to music an absolute pleasure. The Bose Music App has a 3 band EQ that can be used to tweak the sound profile to the user's liking. There are also a few sound presets that can be used as well. I preferred the Bass Boost preset and found the bass to be powerful, while still being defined. I enjoyed the Immersive Audio feature for music because it convincingly enlarges the width and depth of the soundstage. Music impressively seems to be coming from all around. Setup is very straightforward. The Bose Music App is recommended since it opens up the advanced features of the headphones. Since I own other Bose products, I was already using the App so all I had to do was add a device. If this is your first Bose product then you will have to download the App and create an account. Theoretically it is possible to use the headphones without the App, but that is not advisable as you would be locking yourself out of many of the advanced features. Battery life is rated at up to 24 hours. I have been using them extensively for several days without needing a charge, so I consider the battery life to be outstanding. The headphones offer a very advanced Bluetooth Multipoint capability. Taping the Bluetooth button on the headphones switches to the next paired available device. This makes switching the primary audio stream from your phone to another device very easy. This is the smoothest Bluetooth switching implementation I have ever used. Switching from device to device can also be done using the App. The App will list the available device and which device is primary for audio. The build quality for these headphones is as good as the sound quality. They are manufactured from high quality components, and are very comfortable to wear. I would describe the ear cushions and head strap as pillow soft. The included hard case is sturdy and provides excellent protection. The case has a small interior sleeve to store cables and accessories. There is also an interior tag that shows the proper way to fold and insert the headphones into the case. Bose has set the bar once again for the wireless noise canceling headphone market. They have completely exceeded everything else that has come before it. They are expensive, but if you want the best noise canceling performance available, then Bose Ultra is what you want to get.."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m always looking for headphones that provide excellent noise cancellation when working with noisy tools or to just block out the world when needing to recharge. The Bose Quietcomfort Ultras are perfect for just that. There are so many features included in these headphones, but to me the most important quality beyond the sound, is the ability to filter out the noise. When I have these headphones on and use the noise cancelling feature, I am immersed in a sound that is absent of the outside world’s distractions. But let’s talk about the features that enhance these headphones. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the hard-shell case that is made of a leather type of material with a zipper that encompasses nearly the entire perimeter of the case. There is a two-inch cloth material hinge that connects the top to the bottom of the case. Within the case are molded cut outs for the headphone’s cups. This is to ensure a secure fit when stored. Contained in the case is a 12” USB-A to USB-C charging cord and a stereo cable with mini jacks on each end for legacy devices. The headphones themselves are a hard plastic for the ear cups and strap that connects the two headphones’ cups. The portion of the ear cups that contact your ears are a soft leather material and so is the strap that touches your head. There is a power / Bluetooth button, a button that controls the play or pause, skip forward or backward functions depending on how many times the button is pressed. There is a slide/touch button to control the volume and the sound modes. The slide-touch button can be configured for different functions based on your needs. For phone calls there is an included microphone on the Bose which does a great job of filtering out background noise while using the phone. Once you open the packaging for the headphones you are directed to use the smart label to go to the Bose life site to setup your account, download the app for your smartphone to complete the setup process. Within the application you can customize your sound with the different sound modes and a 3 band EQ. Once I completed the setup I was up and running. The sound quality was very good right out of the box and seemed to improve the more I used the headphones. The bass was deep and smooth with clear midrange and crisp highs. Regardless of the type of music I was listening to, the sound was rich and full and brought me into the sound stage. I was able to hear sounds that I hadn’t heard before in the music. The included sound modes consist of the Quiet, Aware, Immersion. Quiet mode removes the outside world so you can hear nothing but the content you are listening to. Aware provides quality sound while letting you stay conscious of your surroundings. Immersion provides realistic sound orientation as you move your head and surrounds you with sound from all directions. It is truly immersive and brings you into the content that you are listening to. Battery life is said to be twenty-four hours and I have been using these headphones for well over a week without charging and they seem to go for ever. Overall, these are one of the best headphones that I have ever had. Between the sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and the build quality, you would be hard pressed to find a sound for the value.', ""Just a little background about me first. I'm a consumer who enjoys a clean and balanced sound stage (no over exaggerated lows mids or highs) when using over ear headphones or in ear buds for the purpose of enjoying different genre's of music. I listen to music often at home, while traveling, and when I'm at work. I'm not specifically an audiophile but one can enjoy a great sounding headphone with amazing features! The new Bose QC Ultra's is now my new favorite headphones. Let me explain why... Upon unboxing you're immediately drawn to the exceptional quality of the case that houses the QC Ultra's. The white smoke color in this headphone looks stunning and premium in appearance. They feel light and comfortable upon trying them on. The leather on the headband and over ear cups are thick and feel plush and can be worn for hours without feeling fatigued. I work in a laboratory setting and I've worn them for 4 to 5 hours at a time and never felt the headband pinching around my ears as well as never feeling sweaty with them on for hours. Now for the sound stage and features... So with every sense of the word phenomenal... I really think Bose hit the nail dead on with the QC Ultra's in my opinion. Once connected via wireless Bluetooth I started listening to various genre’s of music that I enjoy listening to from Rock (Foo Fighters) , Rap (Dre, Snoop, Eminem), Reggae (Bob Marley), R&B, Jazz, Metal (Metallica), and hits from the 80’s to the present day. The initial sound out of the box seems neutral and clean with a precise and pronounced separation. There is an option to adjust a basic EQ setting within the Bose app to your sound preference if you prefer a bump or distinction to your lows, mids or highs. The noise cancellation in the QC Ultra headphones are in the elite/god tier noise cancelling category as they are superior to my Sony XM's, Beats, or Apple air pod pro 2nd gen. They just seem to block out external sound the best in comparison to the other headphones I own when I want to drown out the environment around me! There was two additional features that truly surprised me... First , the immersive audio is amazing to hear and experience with every genre of music I listened. It made me hear my music in a way that resembled a concert or live experience bringing the music to life. It’s the only way I prefer to listen to music when using the QC Ultra’s. 2nd, the transparency mode or what Bose calls awareness mode is very good and is on even ground with the AirPod Pro which for several years had the best transparency feature. The awareness mode in the QC Ultra’s sound balanced and natural while listening to the external environment around me or carrying a conversation while using them. Just a couple of minor cons for me… Since I prefer to use them with immersive audio in use, this feature does drain the battery a bit faster as I’m able to use them on and off at home and work for a couple of days before needing to top of with a recharge. Bose claims approx 18 hrs which is respectable and that is roughly about the same amount of hours I was able to obtain before needing a recharge. It would have been amazing to get another 8 to 10 hrs of battery life while using immersive audio. Also, there are times I’m unable to physically answer a call or play and pause a track since it requires to physically press a button within the headphones. I work in a laboratory while wearing a lab coat, face shield and gloves and my only option is to remove one glove to use the headphones if I’m interrupted while working. It would be a game changer if Bose added a basic gesture or voice recognition feature to pause/play music or answer/end a call hands free as a future feature. Overall impression… The QC Ultra’s are very impressive in every aspect with premium sound and top tier level features! They feel comfortable and look sleek with a high end quality build. Bose has a winner with the release of the QC Ultra’s and I’ll be happily using and endorsing them to family and friends who are looking for a premium headphone! You cannot go wrong with these…. Breathtaking immersive audio sound with top tier noise cancelling and transparency/awareness features! My collection of headphones have grown and these will be the ones I’ll be reaching for the most! Great job Bose!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] _____ *Pros: -Premium look and feel. -Smells nice. -Spatial audio is very cool and more than a gimmick. -Great passive noise isolation. -Comfortable to wear for hours on end. -Good battery life. -Easy to fold and put away inside the case. _____ *Neutral: -Out of the box audio is so-so. Tune-up required with the Bose Music app. _____ *Cons: -None *** Build Quality and Comfort *** The first thing that impressed upon me when I unboxed the Bose Ultra was how nice and premium it looked and felt. Mine’s the White Smoke color option and I feel it looks more high-end, premium, and classy than the black option. My two previous Bose headphones were black so this was a welcome change of scenery. The sense of premium-ness continues when handling the Ultra – the pleather feels soft and plush, and the plastic components feel dense and silky smooth with no harsh graininess. The padding is soft and comfortable, and the earcups are supple, comfy, and provide good passive noise isolation. The QC Ultra folds, swivels, and tucks away neatly and smoothly with nary a cheap-feeling sound or awkward movements. There was another aspect of the Ultra that I didn’t expect but was pleasantly surprised by – these headphones smell great! Specifically, the Ultra headphone gives off that new car smell scent that I like so much. The scent is strongest on the pleather parts such as the earcups. As for the rest of the Ultra, I have no complaints and I’m quite happy with the entire package. The fit and finish is excellent, the buttons are clickity and responsive, and the capacitive swipe area on the right earcup works perfectly for volume control. I’ve been using the Ultra mostly at work where I work at a cubicle with many colleagues nearby. Some of them are quite noisy, and these headphones provide peace for hours and hours without hurting the top of my head or my ears. After extended use, my ear areas do get a bit sweaty and warm but not uncomfortably so. Ergonomically, the QC Ultra is a Win. *** Audio performance *** I expected great audio fidelity and quality from the Ultras, and I was not left disappointed or pinned with buyer’s remorse. The Ultra lives up to Bose’s hard-earned and well-deserved reputation for quality and slick execution and Bose takes it to a new level by introducing Immersive Audio, which is a fancy spatial audio technology that makes the audio source feel like it’s right there with you and nearby instead of some audio signals leaking out of the earcups. By connecting the Ultra to the Bose Music app, one can choose the Immersive Audio setting of your choice – Off, Still, and Motion. Bose recommends the “Still” option for those sitting down and not moving around much, and the “Motion” option for those who are walking and going to places. I liked both options and used Immersive Audio anytime I was listening to music on the Ultra. It really does add a new sense of audio depth and increases the breadth of the soundstage beyond what “regular” headphones can do. I frankly expected Immersive Audio to be a clever marketing gimmick from Bose that I would try a few times and turn off but it turned out to be more than that – it truly adds something novel and makes the music listening experience more fun and interesting. After getting used to Immersive Audio, other headsets are going to feel more boring and duller. If by any chance you choose not to use the Immersive Audio option, you still get great audio fidelity and quality from the QC Ultra. Just don’t expect a big difference from the outgoing Bose 700 or QC 45 headsets. The active noise cancellation is slightly better in the QC Ultra, but the general audio quality sounds pretty similar to the older headsets. I did notice better bass on the QC Ultras though. Overall, it’s really hard to go wrong by choosing the QC Ultra. The audio quality is excellent, and it’s made fantastic thanks to Immersive Audio (spatial audio). *** Battery life *** Frankly speaking, the battery life is not that much improved over my older Bose QC45 headphones. Still, the endurance level is good enough for my particular situation and I’m content with it. I’m never too far away from a charging cable so battery life hasn’t been an issue for me. *** Is it worth the coin? *** If you got the coin for it, then the QC Ultra headphones are definitely worth it. You’re getting superb active noise cancellation, clean and high-fidelity audio, and with Immersive Audio turned on, a new and interesting way to listen to music both familiar and new. I wouldn’t hesitate recommending the QC Ultra to friends and family. 5 Stars.']"

As i write this review I'm wearing the headphones so I can focus while my son is watching TV. FEATURES: The setup with the app was very easy and the app itself is great. By you have 3 modes configured by default: Quiet, Aware and Immersion. You can add or remove any that you want and you can customize the amount of noise cancelling, on a scale of 1-10. You can adjust the EQ using the app, I like to boost the bass. The only negative think about these headphones is the voice it uses for feedback, like telling you what device it's connected to or what mode you just switched to. It's just really horrible and hard to listen to. Fortunately you don't have to listen to it very often, but there are much better voice readers out there, so it's kind of disappointing. Ultimately, the voice doesn't affect the experience all that much. BOTTOM LINE: I am so glad I have these headphones when for when I go into the office, but I'll be using them for more than just noise cancellation. The audio quality is superior to anything I've had before, so I'll be reaching for these headphones next time I listen to music. I would definitely recommend these headphones."", ""I received my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in color: White Smoke and am very impressed by the sleek and stylish lightweight design with only two buttons: Multi-Function/Bluetooth buttons and a volume strip, where you can easily swipe up or down to adjust volume, all located on the right side of the earcup. The headphones are padded nicely around head and ears and provide exceptional comfort level after several hours of wear. I work from home and live in town where it can get pretty noisy during the day, so really needed a pair of good noise cancelling headphones to drown out the noise of the traffic and such. My favorite starred setting when working is Quiet Mode which provides exceptional Acoustic Noise Cancelling, and I found that my production increased due to being able to concentrate more on my work by not hearing all the distracting noises that entail with working from home. When I'm not working, I love to watch movies and listen to music with my Bose surround sound system, and glad that I can easily switch between devices and pair my new headphones with my sound bar as this especially helps when it's late at night and don't want to disturb or wake others. My favorite setting for movies and music is Immersion Mode which takes it to another level of complete bliss where the music literally wraps you up and sweeps you away! I'm so impressed with the quality of sound, it's so crisp and clean! The Bose app. is a must for set-up since there's no paper manual provided. There are so many cool features, tips, and shortcuts available in the app. to where you can customize your headphones to your liking and needs, such as the Equalizer (EQ) where you can add more or less Bass & Treble. I like that I can be listening to music and able to receive phone calls, which pause my song and then resume playing after my call. Very cool and convenient Sleep/Wake features, where the headphones automatically go into sleep mode when I take them off and then wake up when you put them on, and automatically powers off after 24hrs. of inactivity all while saving battery life. There are some things to be mindful of, such as the recommended safe handling suggests placing your hands around the middle of each earcup when removing from and putting back in case as this helps keep fingers away from the hinges, so they don't get pinched. It is also not recommended to use headphones near water or moisture of any kind and to clean with a dry cloth only! I knew that Bose would have the best pair of headphones available that would meet my needs and expectations and beyond, and they have always been my number one choice and have been very happy with all their products that I've purchased over the years. Bose also has exceptional and knowledgeable customer service agents to help with all your needs and concerns. I highly recommend these headphones and all Bose products to friends, family, and to all music lovers out there! There's no comparison when it comes to Bose, they are simply the best!"", 'I love sound and technological innovations small and large because greatness isn’t in just one thing… it’s in everything even the ordinary. And I am truly honored to have this opportunity to review such a breakthrough product on so many levels. A true game changer. Phenomenal Sound Quality True immersion personified and I love being able to toggle between all three settings from immersion to quiet to awake and I love how when you take the QC ULTRAS off of your head they pause where you left off and start back playing where they were when you took them off when you place them back on your ears. Love how you can push the headset on and off so easily. This is hands down the most comfortable and sleekest headset I’ve ever owned and the performance I’ve ever owned and the performance and technological advances are out of this world combined with a simplistic yet sophisticated user friendly usability. If you want a head turning headset with stellar performance and daily use greatness than look no further than the QC ULTRAS. Cormfort is pillow soft to your ears to the point you don’t want to take them off in a good way. Ears aren’t encumbered in anyway. QC ULTRAS are a complete game changer and a must have for sound aficionados. QC ULTRAS gives you a front row seat why evolution is necessary in all facets of life if you are in the pursuit of true undeniable greatness… this headset is in my opinion epitomizes Bose’s exemplary sound quality and is their crowning achievement to date. Wore the QC ULTRAS for like two hours straight and felt like I never had anything on my ears at all even though I know for certain I did and since then I’ve worn them multiple times for even longer and feel like I could wear them 10 hours straight easy with little to no ear fatigue along with the lightness of the headset itself. Did a light workout with the QC ULTRAS and the performance was stellar and I felt zoned in on my workout in a real way but where the QC ULTRAS truly excel is in leisure and wearing walking around all day or laying down all day. The aware setting is out of this world game changing. I can hear the wind blowing, my portable electric air pump pumping my tire and I just had a full conversation in Walmart at Customer Service about electric cars and gasoline cars… the funny thing about it is the attendant was initially like you can’t even hear us can you sit and I was like these the new Bose QC ULTRAS so I can hear everything y’all saying… and to be able to say that out loud is a game changer in and of itself and was just unreal because I really could hear everything they were saying. It’s even clearer for me now after my third ownership of a Bose product why Bose is the best in the sound game in my opinion. I was able to talk to two people at once and fully engage with them in their conversation and add to it all while getting my customer service needs meet and all while still listening to music… Now that’s dope and something that a person like myself who highly values portability and versatility doesn’t take for granted.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Even though I have used some amazing wireless headphones before, and my personal bar is set very high, I was still absolutely blown away by how exceptional the performance of these headphones are. The noise canceling and sound quality are the best in their class. Bose Ultra is now the new standard for wireless noise canceling headphones, to which all others will be compared. Bose was one of the original pioneers of noise canceling technology, and they have made some excellent products over the years, but they have found a way to set the bar even higher with Bose Ultra. When wearing them, I feel like I am in my own personal bubble of sound. I was not able to test them on an airplane, but I am looking forward to using them the next time I fly. Sound quality is also excellent. They produce powerful, full-range, high fidelity sound that makes watching movies and listening to music an absolute pleasure. The Bose Music App has a 3 band EQ that can be used to tweak the sound profile to the user's liking. There are also a few sound presets that can be used as well. I preferred the Bass Boost preset and found the bass to be powerful, while still being defined. I enjoyed the Immersive Audio feature for music because it convincingly enlarges the width and depth of the soundstage. Music impressively seems to be coming from all around. Setup is very straightforward. The Bose Music App is recommended since it opens up the advanced features of the headphones. Since I own other Bose products, I was already using the App so all I had to do was add a device. If this is your first Bose product then you will have to download the App and create an account. Theoretically it is possible to use the headphones without the App, but that is not advisable as you would be locking yourself out of many of the advanced features. Battery life is rated at up to 24 hours. I have been using them extensively for several days without needing a charge, so I consider the battery life to be outstanding. The headphones offer a very advanced Bluetooth Multipoint capability. Taping the Bluetooth button on the headphones switches to the next paired available device. This makes switching the primary audio stream from your phone to another device very easy. This is the smoothest Bluetooth switching implementation I have ever used. Switching from device to device can also be done using the App. The App will list the available device and which device is primary for audio. The build quality for these headphones is as good as the sound quality. They are manufactured from high quality components, and are very comfortable to wear. I would describe the ear cushions and head strap as pillow soft. The included hard case is sturdy and provides excellent protection. The case has a small interior sleeve to store cables and accessories. There is also an interior tag that shows the proper way to fold and insert the headphones into the case. Bose has set the bar once again for the wireless noise canceling headphone market. They have completely exceeded everything else that has come before it. They are expensive, but if you want the best noise canceling performance available, then Bose Ultra is what you want to get.."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m always looking for headphones that provide excellent noise cancellation when working with noisy tools or to just block out the world when needing to recharge. The Bose Quietcomfort Ultras are perfect for just that. There are so many features included in these headphones, but to me the most important quality beyond the sound, is the ability to filter out the noise. When I have these headphones on and use the noise cancelling feature, I am immersed in a sound that is absent of the outside world’s distractions. But let’s talk about the features that enhance these headphones. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the hard-shell case that is made of a leather type of material with a zipper that encompasses nearly the entire perimeter of the case. There is a two-inch cloth material hinge that connects the top to the bottom of the case. Within the case are molded cut outs for the headphone’s cups. This is to ensure a secure fit when stored. Contained in the case is a 12” USB-A to USB-C charging cord and a stereo cable with mini jacks on each end for legacy devices. The headphones themselves are a hard plastic for the ear cups and strap that connects the two headphones’ cups. The portion of the ear cups that contact your ears are a soft leather material and so is the strap that touches your head. There is a power / Bluetooth button, a button that controls the play or pause, skip forward or backward functions depending on how many times the button is pressed. There is a slide/touch button to control the volume and the sound modes. The slide-touch button can be configured for different functions based on your needs. For phone calls there is an included microphone on the Bose which does a great job of filtering out background noise while using the phone. Once you open the packaging for the headphones you are directed to use the smart label to go to the Bose life site to setup your account, download the app for your smartphone to complete the setup process. Within the application you can customize your sound with the different sound modes and a 3 band EQ. Once I completed the setup I was up and running. The sound quality was very good right out of the box and seemed to improve the more I used the headphones. The bass was deep and smooth with clear midrange and crisp highs. Regardless of the type of music I was listening to, the sound was rich and full and brought me into the sound stage. I was able to hear sounds that I hadn’t heard before in the music. The included sound modes consist of the Quiet, Aware, Immersion. Quiet mode removes the outside world so you can hear nothing but the content you are listening to. Aware provides quality sound while letting you stay conscious of your surroundings. Immersion provides realistic sound orientation as you move your head and surrounds you with sound from all directions. It is truly immersive and brings you into the content that you are listening to. Battery life is said to be twenty-four hours and I have been using these headphones for well over a week without charging and they seem to go for ever. Overall, these are one of the best headphones that I have ever had. Between the sound quality, noise cancellation, comfort, and the build quality, you would be hard pressed to find a sound for the value.', ""Just a little background about me first. I'm a consumer who enjoys a clean and balanced sound stage (no over exaggerated lows mids or highs) when using over ear headphones or in ear buds for the purpose of enjoying different genre's of music. I listen to music often at home, while traveling, and when I'm at work. I'm not specifically an audiophile but one can enjoy a great sounding headphone with amazing features! The new Bose QC Ultra's is now my new favorite headphones. Let me explain why... Upon unboxing you're immediately drawn to the exceptional quality of the case that houses the QC Ultra's. The white smoke color in this headphone looks stunning and premium in appearance. They feel light and comfortable upon trying them on. The leather on the headband and over ear cups are thick and feel plush and can be worn for hours without feeling fatigued. I work in a laboratory setting and I've worn them for 4 to 5 hours at a time and never felt the headband pinching around my ears as well as never feeling sweaty with them on for hours. Now for the sound stage and features... So with every sense of the word phenomenal... I really think Bose hit the nail dead on with the QC Ultra's in my opinion. Once connected via wireless Bluetooth I started listening to various genre’s of music that I enjoy listening to from Rock (Foo Fighters) , Rap (Dre, Snoop, Eminem), Reggae (Bob Marley), R&B, Jazz, Metal (Metallica), and hits from the 80’s to the present day. The initial sound out of the box seems neutral and clean with a precise and pronounced separation. There is an option to adjust a basic EQ setting within the Bose app to your sound preference if you prefer a bump or distinction to your lows, mids or highs. The noise cancellation in the QC Ultra headphones are in the elite/god tier noise cancelling category as they are superior to my Sony XM's, Beats, or Apple air pod pro 2nd gen. They just seem to block out external sound the best in comparison to the other headphones I own when I want to drown out the environment around me! There was two additional features that truly surprised me... First , the immersive audio is amazing to hear and experience with every genre of music I listened. It made me hear my music in a way that resembled a concert or live experience bringing the music to life. It’s the only way I prefer to listen to music when using the QC Ultra’s. 2nd, the transparency mode or what Bose calls awareness mode is very good and is on even ground with the AirPod Pro which for several years had the best transparency feature. The awareness mode in the QC Ultra’s sound balanced and natural while listening to the external environment around me or carrying a conversation while using them. Just a couple of minor cons for me… Since I prefer to use them with immersive audio in use, this feature does drain the battery a bit faster as I’m able to use them on and off at home and work for a couple of days before needing to top of with a recharge. Bose claims approx 18 hrs which is respectable and that is roughly about the same amount of hours I was able to obtain before needing a recharge. It would have been amazing to get another 8 to 10 hrs of battery life while using immersive audio. Also, there are times I’m unable to physically answer a call or play and pause a track since it requires to physically press a button within the headphones. I work in a laboratory while wearing a lab coat, face shield and gloves and my only option is to remove one glove to use the headphones if I’m interrupted while working. It would be a game changer if Bose added a basic gesture or voice recognition feature to pause/play music or answer/end a call hands free as a future feature. Overall impression… The QC Ultra’s are very impressive in every aspect with premium sound and top tier level features! They feel comfortable and look sleek with a high end quality build. Bose has a winner with the release of the QC Ultra’s and I’ll be happily using and endorsing them to family and friends who are looking for a premium headphone! You cannot go wrong with these…. Breathtaking immersive audio sound with top tier noise cancelling and transparency/awareness features! My collection of headphones have grown and these will be the ones I’ll be reaching for the most! Great job Bose!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] _____ *Pros: -Premium look and feel. -Smells nice. -Spatial audio is very cool and more than a gimmick. -Great passive noise isolation. -Comfortable to wear for hours on end. -Good battery life. -Easy to fold and put away inside the case. _____ *Neutral: -Out of the box audio is so-so. Tune-up required with the Bose Music app. _____ *Cons: -None *** Build Quality and Comfort *** The first thing that impressed upon me when I unboxed the Bose Ultra was how nice and premium it looked and felt. Mine’s the White Smoke color option and I feel it looks more high-end, premium, and classy than the black option. My two previous Bose headphones were black so this was a welcome change of scenery. The sense of premium-ness continues when handling the Ultra – the pleather feels soft and plush, and the plastic components feel dense and silky smooth with no harsh graininess. The padding is soft and comfortable, and the earcups are supple, comfy, and provide good passive noise isolation. The QC Ultra folds, swivels, and tucks away neatly and smoothly with nary a cheap-feeling sound or awkward movements. There was another aspect of the Ultra that I didn’t expect but was pleasantly surprised by – these headphones smell great! Specifically, the Ultra headphone gives off that new car smell scent that I like so much. The scent is strongest on the pleather parts such as the earcups. As for the rest of the Ultra, I have no complaints and I’m quite happy with the entire package. The fit and finish is excellent, the buttons are clickity and responsive, and the capacitive swipe area on the right earcup works perfectly for volume control. I’ve been using the Ultra mostly at work where I work at a cubicle with many colleagues nearby. Some of them are quite noisy, and these headphones provide peace for hours and hours without hurting the top of my head or my ears. After extended use, my ear areas do get a bit sweaty and warm but not uncomfortably so. Ergonomically, the QC Ultra is a Win. *** Audio performance *** I expected great audio fidelity and quality from the Ultras, and I was not left disappointed or pinned with buyer’s remorse. The Ultra lives up to Bose’s hard-earned and well-deserved reputation for quality and slick execution and Bose takes it to a new level by introducing Immersive Audio, which is a fancy spatial audio technology that makes the audio source feel like it’s right there with you and nearby instead of some audio signals leaking out of the earcups. By connecting the Ultra to the Bose Music app, one can choose the Immersive Audio setting of your choice – Off, Still, and Motion. Bose recommends the “Still” option for those sitting down and not moving around much, and the “Motion” option for those who are walking and going to places. I liked both options and used Immersive Audio anytime I was listening to music on the Ultra. It really does add a new sense of audio depth and increases the breadth of the soundstage beyond what “regular” headphones can do. I frankly expected Immersive Audio to be a clever marketing gimmick from Bose that I would try a few times and turn off but it turned out to be more than that – it truly adds something novel and makes the music listening experience more fun and interesting. After getting used to Immersive Audio, other headsets are going to feel more boring and duller. If by any chance you choose not to use the Immersive Audio option, you still get great audio fidelity and quality from the QC Ultra. Just don’t expect a big difference from the outgoing Bose 700 or QC 45 headsets. The active noise cancellation is slightly better in the QC Ultra, but the general audio quality sounds pretty similar to the older headsets. I did notice better bass on the QC Ultras though. Overall, it’s really hard to go wrong by choosing the QC Ultra. The audio quality is excellent, and it’s made fantastic thanks to Immersive Audio (spatial audio). *** Battery life *** Frankly speaking, the battery life is not that much improved over my older Bose QC45 headphones. Still, the endurance level is good enough for my particular situation and I’m content with it. I’m never too far away from a charging cable so battery life hasn’t been an issue for me. *** Is it worth the coin? *** If you got the coin for it, then the QC Ultra headphones are definitely worth it. You’re getting superb active noise cancellation, clean and high-fidelity audio, and with Immersive Audio turned on, a new and interesting way to listen to music both familiar and new. I wouldn’t hesitate recommending the QC Ultra to friends and family. 5 Stars.']"
Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$249.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-ult-wear-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-black/17902839/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This the second Sony headphones I have and this really beats the sound from my old ones. I’m amazed with the powerful Cristal sound quality using the ULT system, I really enjoy this feature on my headphones, just click on the side of the headphones ULT and you can get ultra bass sound on any song you love and with the great noise cancellation that this headphones provides, you can only hear your music and nothing else, I used this headphones while using my lawnmower on my yard and I definitely couldn’t even hear the noise from the lawnmower, that’s just great for me. Even though this headphones are a little bulky, they sure are super comfortable on your ears, and with the help of the Music apps it analyzes your ears for the 360 live experience app and the Sony app, this helps you get the best sound quality. This headphones includes a swivel designs that folds into the included case comes very handy and best suited for traveling or putting them in your gym bag. Other great feature that this headphones have is the battery life, very outstanding battery performance that could last up to 30 hrs, I used this headphones for at least 4/5 hours and it was still on 80% charge, very impressive. On the right side of the headphones you get touch sensor control panel that help you control the volume or play and pause your music with just a tap. The app has a lot of features that helps you set up your headphones the way you want to use them like analyze your ears for best quality sound, keep track of your music and battery life and also detects if you’re seat down or walking with the headphones, also you get free trial of 360 live app, which the 360 live app could use some more updates. The multipoint connection could use a little better upgrade but I’m not really in need of this feature since I only use this headphones with my iPhone. Great headphones ! Recommended.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One thing which you can always rely on, in my experience, is quality electronics from Sony. The Sony Ult Headphones are no exception. While I’m by no means an audiophile, I know the difference between “noisy” headsets and clear ones. These headphones were clear, loud, and comfortable which is the checklist for a good set of wireless headphones. Bonus: these bluetooth headphones have a microphone so you can make and take phone calls, which is handy if you’re out on a run. In the box you have a black firm zipper case which holds the foldable headset, the charging cable, and a 3.5 audio hardline. Buttons are minimal: power, Noise Canceling/Ambient, and the ULT bass boost mode button. No volume or skipping track? No, the ear cups are touch sensitive so that you swipe left/right for volume and up/down for fast forward/backward/skip track forward/backward. Coolest of all though is that if you cup the headphone it automatically goes into passthrough mode so you can carry on a conversation/hear the announcements at the airport, etc. The battery life is extraordinary, the box lists them as lasting 30 hours and I’ve yet to charge them or have them die on me. These are going to be excellent travel headphones! I would fault them only due to the ULT bass boost, which thumped my brain into jelly. It's not required to use it but it's the main marketing feature so it bears stating its a bit much. Although I’ve never been one for extra bass, call me old but I like to hear my music not break apart the molecules in my head. If you’re one of those people that plays the bass in your car so loud it vibrates the mirrors of the cars a block away then you’re going to put these on a pedestal as your new favorite music accessory. As headphones go these are probably the best I’ve ever owned with a lot of neat bells and whistles to really set them apart from the competition. The big draw for some will be the HUGE bass found in the Ult button but to me the great sound quality with super long battery life is the reason to get these. No matter which side you fall on these aren’t headphones you’ll regret getting."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been using these Sony ULT WEAR headphones for the past week and although I was initially put off by the feel and sound of these headphones, they've since grown on me after figuring out all the little details / things you can do when paired with the Sony Headphones app. I am going to say that it is an absolute must download so that you can fully experience and enjoy these headphones. Sony provides a QR code on the manual to find the app, but you can also search for it in the iOS and Android stores. Build Quality - These headphones are really lightweight for their size. The plastics used have this non textured / smooth feel that I'm not really used to headphones having. So they kind of tricked my brain into thinking they feel cheap. But after a week of use, I can honestly say that these headphones are quite touch and the build material is excellent. The headband and earcups are strong and do not creak when you flex them to put them on your head or when moving a cup out of the way to hear something or someone. Which while Im on that subject, these headphones have a cool feature where all you have to do is place your hand over the right ear cup and it will automatically lower the volume of your music or media very low so that you can hear your surroundings. The headphones have three buttons. Power on /off , ANC/Ambient which toggles noise canceling on and off. and ULT. The ULT button toggles through 3 different presets which to my ears boost bass from almost flat to thump thump on your ears. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack for connecting the included wire to your devices. I am happy to report that with the included aux cable, you do not have to turn on the headphones for them to work with the cable. So they work passively! but you will not get any of the software features while using them with this method. Sound Quality - My first thoughts out of the box when I paired them to my phone and started listening to music were something along the lines of Yuuck. They sounded quite muddy and the bass / mids drowned out everything else. But like I said earlier.. downloading the Sony headphones app is an absolute must to use these headphones. It will allow you to customize the EQ to your liking, and it does it quite easily. It will let you tap through various settings and tune it to what you like. It was honestly the coolest and most intuitive equalizer tuning I've experience so far. After setting up the EQ and presets to my preferences , these headphones sound soooo much better and they've grown on me for the past week. Are they the best headphones I've ever heard? No. but the ability to easily and quickly tweak the EQ makes them fun and a joy to use. It's very hard to find 1 pair of headphones that will be perfect for every music genre, movie, podcast listening experience. So being able to tune my listening experience on the fly makes these quite enjoyable. They are very comfortable for extended use, lightweight, and battery life is amazing! Even after a week of casual use, the headphones still show 85% battery remaining. So would I recommend these headphones? I'm going to say Yes. But only if you're willing to download that app and set them up properly. If you don't want to bother with all of that, then perhaps look at something else."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great Ample bass for bass heads Quick access to drop the bass when not in the mood Customizable EQ Includes EQ profiles Comfortable Good ANC Good microphone Includes case Long battery life Multipoint Bluetooth (2 devices) On ear detection for automatically pausing music Spatial audio support Not so great Ambient mode makes your voice resonate Sound profile not as good for acoustic or rock Find my equalizer wizard profiles all add bass No USB-C audio The Sony Ult Wear is the successor to the outgoing WH-X910N. Targeted at those who love more bass there is now a dedicated Ult button which offers two levels of bass boost. The overall look and feel are like other Sony over the ear headphones. Included in the box is a case, stereo jack, and USB-C cable. While they don’t feel as solid as premium headphones with more metal and plush materials they do feel well built. Setup 8/10 You can use them as is, but you are better off installing the app to tune them to your specific preference. As part of the setup, you have options to find the best EQ for you. It works ok, the range of options is limited. It only has options to add more bass and nothing to brighten up the sound for those who prefer to have livelier vocals. Thankfully if you skip that option, you can find EQ presets like bright or mellow. If you need further tuning, you manually adjust a 5-band equalizer. There are also spatial audio options where you can have it take pictures of your ears to adjust automatically to optimize spatial audio for you. However, it requires a subscription to one of five supported streaming services. You also have options for Bluetooth audio to prioritize stability or sound quality. An audio upscaling option called DSEE is available as well to attempt to enhance the quality of low-quality audio. If you want to forgo Bluetooth compression you can use them hardwired via a stereo jack, but there is no option for USB-C audio for newer devices. Comfort 9/10 For mid-tier headphones the design is very comfortable. The clamping pressure is slightly higher than preferred but not to the point of uncomfortable. The size adjustment is via click adjustments in the band that have a slightly cheap feeling. The earcups are large and should accommodate most ears with lots of cushion. While the earcups don’t feel like they breathe they haven’t caused heat buildup like some headphones can. The top band of the headphones rests directly on your head, unlike some that suspend the headband cushion separately. That said, it has enough cushion to where extended sessions haven’t felt uncomfortable. Controls 10/10 Sony’s design for headphone controls is likely some of the easiest to use on the market. Controls for power, ULT, and ANC are left as physical buttons, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally changing them or having too many gestures to remember. Controls for track, volume, and conversation are done via gestures to make access quick without needing to see or feel anything. Play and pause is a double tap on the right earcup, changing tracks is a forward or backwards swipe, and an up or down swipe changes volume. If you need to talk to someone for a moment you can just hold your hand over the right earcup, and the volume lowers and ambient mode activates. When done you remove your hand, and everything continues where you had it set. They also have detection for if you are wearing them so you can simply take them off your head and they pause. A little while after that without use they turn off not requiring you to do or remember anything. Control choices are thoughtful and make controlling the headphones natural. Sound Quality 9/10 Out of the box the headphones have a sound like older Sony headphones from the early 2000s with a darker tone to highs and the bass emphasized. The Ult Wear can work for acoustic and rock with some tuning, but the soundstage will remain shallow. There is no mistaking these are designed for bass heads. If you like electronic, dance, or hip hop you are likely going to be very happy. It’s hard to imagine anyone saying they need more bass. On the default setting the bass is only slightly elevated from neutral. Ult 1 setting can be activated with a single press of the ULT button. This level is likely good for most who love some extra bass. Ult 2 is where it gets into extreme categories. With the right song ULT 2 feels like it is trying to vibrate your skull and makes your ears vibrate. The bass hits hard when needed or smooth and clean with no hint of distortion. If that still isn’t enough bass for you there is a bass boost EQ present. That wasn’t tried as it already felt like keeping it on level 2 for very long was going to result in hearing loss. If your EQ preference changes with mood these have a pretty wide range. No surprise they can’t reach the fidelity and more neutral sound of high-end headphones, but they have a pretty wide range of adjustment while offering far more bass than high end headphones can. ANC 10/10 Active noise cancelling has been improved a lot over the last few years and Sony. The noise cancelling on the Ult Wear does a great job of cancelling out distracting sounds regardless of if you are trying to relax or get work done. You can sit right net a noisy fan and just hear a low hum. Turn some music on even at a low volume and the noise fades away completely. It even reduces the volume of speech. If you need to get work done in a noise environment, even with people talking, it does a great job of eliminating most and reducing the rest to allow your music to take over without needing to turn the volume up to uncomfortable levels. Microphone 7/10 The Microphone is probably the weakest area of the Ult Wear. They filter out some background noise but if you talk to someone in a noisy environment they will hear some background noise. The microphones are also used in ambient mode, and it can be set to have your voice played back so speech sounds more natural. The most natural setting is to set voice feedback volume to maximum. It prevents the sound of your voice resonating while allowing more background noises around to be played back as well. Your voice will sill be a bit distance and hollow but thankfully it won’t be resonating in your head like some ambient solutions. Final Thoughts The Sony Ult Wear headphones are a solid mid-tier bass forward set of headphones. Sony could make them better with some minor tweaking to the default EQ profile and the find EQ wizard, but the rest is solid. If you are a bass head, even part time, and are in the market for mid-tier headphones with good range then Sony Ult Wear headphones are a solid offering.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] 📦 UNBOXING: The unboxing experience for the Sony ULT Wear is straightforward. Inside the box is a nice rigid protective zip case. Inside the case, you’ll find the ULT Wear headphone, a 3.5mm cable for analog listening, and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable. 💪 BUILD: The build of the ULT Wear is a lightweight plastic and weighs in at 255g. There are lighter headphones out there, but the ULT Wear is certainly light while also being well-made. The material feels confident overall, and will hold up to day-to-day treatment. The design looks good without being gaudy or attention-grabbing. I like its understated look, but it may not be as aesthetically pleasing as some other headphones on the market. The headband can be adjusted with a tactile click to accommodate a wide range of head sizes, and the ear cups also rotate in either direction, but if you wear them around your neck, they can’t face fully outward. The case itself is also very good and the rigidity will ensure that the headphone won’t get crushed in a bag. Some folks might prefer a bit more flex since it means it will take up more bag space, but it’s a tradeoff I’m personally willing to take. Whether or not you decide to use a case is up to you, as you can also just fold them up and put them in your bag. 🎧 COMFORT: The comfort of the ULT Wear is excellent. I’ve seen a lot of headphones these days take the route of making thinner and thinner headbands for better aesthetics, but Sony has opted to keep things very comfortable with the ULT Wear. The headband padding is plentiful and soft without any rigid pressure points, so the apex of my scalp is free from any discomfort. The ear pads are also very comfortable, with a nice plush foam material that avoids wrinkles and creates a nice seal for your ears. This is a headphone I could wear for many hours at a time—especially for work in a noisy office, or on an international flight. I’ve tried other Sony consumer headphones, and I’ve really liked these recent designs for comfort, even compared to something like the XM5. 🎛️ CONTROLS: The control scheme is very familiar like the more premium Sony consumer headphones. On the left earcup, you have your power button which can also function as your pairing button and battery status, the noise cancellation/ambient sound toggle, and the new ULT button which adds a bass shelf for thick bass. On the right earcup, you can use swipe gestures for volume controls, playback/pause, and skipping tracks. And it also has a built-in sensor that detects when you’ve removed the headphones so it can instantly pause when you need to address a disruption. Then putting the headphones back on will resume playback. 📱 APP: The Sony Headphones Connect app has largely remained the same for a number of years now, and while nothing is inherently broken, it’s also not the most “delightful” app I’ve used. Thankfully, you won’t need to use it much after you’ve configured it the way you want. But I would recommend checking back every now and again to see if any firmware updates have been released that improve the performance of the ULT Wear. In the app, you’ll be able to set up a basic 5-band EQ and go through a personalization test which will prompt you with a few EQ adjustments to preview as you listen to your own music. And after a few prompts, you’ll have a custom EQ to work with. For me, I received a mild increase in treble energy. Additionally, the app allows you to toggle multipoint connections should you want to simultaneously connect 2 devices to the ULT Wear. 🎵 SOUND: The out of the box sound profile of the ULT Wear is very inoffensive to my ears. In large part, it gets most things right for a consumer-oriented sound experience. It’s not too bright, and it’s not too bassy, but it still has room to deviate for individual preferences. But if I didn’t have an option to EQ, I’d frankly be pretty happy with the stock sound. As an avid listener of Pop R&B, Metal and instrumental music, I felt the ULT Wear out of the box was good at representing the characteristics of these genres I’ve come to expect without breaking my immersion. In the case of more bass-emphatic music, the ULT button can be pressed to enable ULT1 or ULT2 which creates a much thicker bass shelf. Personally, I did not like ULT2 at all, as it degraded the overall clarity to deliver an overwhelming quantity of bass. However, ULT1 I did feel could be tasteful for bass heads, assuming you have the right library of music that is well-mixed for this bass shelf. Frankly, for the price, the out-of-box sound is better than quite a number of more expensive headphones I’ve heard. I wouldn’t call it audiophile level, as I don’t think it quite reaches that level of immersion for me, but it exceeded my expectations, as I was also not a fan of the XM5, but I quite enjoy the ULT Wear. 🔊 ANC / AMBIENT SOUND: The ANC is no slouch, despite this being a more mid-range headphone for Sony. The ULT Wear sports the same Sony V1 processor as the XM5 for ANC, and it does a great job at keeping a low noise floor and canceling out background noise. It also has an anti-wind sensor for blocking sounds from wind while wearing the ULT Wear. The ANC trades blows with the XM5, and when compared to other options in its own price bracket, it’s among the best. As for the Ambient mode—it’s easily one of the more impressive implementations I’ve heard recently. Without any audio playing, you can clearly hear the environment and speech without it sounding unnatural. Personally, I was very impressed—even compared to more expensive headphones with ambient sound modes. Sony really landed with a solid implementation on the ULT Wear. 🎙️ MICROPHONE: The microphone on the ULT Wear does a great job in less-noisy environments. It can isolate your voice clearly without making you sound muffled or distant. But in louder environments like city streets, the microphone noise cancellation might struggle a bit and cause your voice to break up a bit, but it still holds up better than quite a few other microphones I’ve tested. 🔋 BATTERY: Sony claims the ULT Wear can reach 50 hours of battery on a full charge with ANC disabled. With ANC engaged, it can achieve up to 30 hours on battery. This is competitive with most other options on the market, and even outperforming some premium options on the market. Sony also says that a quick 3 minute charge can yield 1.5 hours of non-ANC playback and a 10-minute charge can yield 5 hours of non-ANC playback. But for a full charge from dead, Sony says 3.5 hours will bring it to a full charge. 🧐 CONCLUSION: The Sony ULT Wear is a win for consumers, in my opinion. It delivers a good consumer-friendly sound out of the box without being offensive. But I do wish Sony would give consumers more choice when it comes to their EQ, since more advanced users are still hindered by a basic 5-band EQ. Even so, I liked the out of box sound, but felt the ULT modes were hit or miss, and you’ll probably find yourself toggling it if you have a library of mixed genres. But there’s no denying the ULT Wear can be a fantastic commuter headphone thanks to its ANC and excellent comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love it. I’ve been planning to buy the Sony XM4 headphones because of the noise cancellation but once I tried these on it was a no brainer. The noise cancellation nearly blocks out EVERYTHING and once my music plays you can consider me deaf because I won’t hear a thing. The bass is also one of my favorite features, it’s absolutely amazing as well as the sound quality. They’re also very comfortable on my ears which is a big thing for me because I wear glasses so many headphones start to hurt my ears after a while because they push into my glasses but I can wear these for hours and not feel a thing. Battery life is also a plus as well as the fully customizable capability in the app. 12/10 recommend', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I picked up a pair of XM4s a few days before realizing these new ULT Wear headphones were coming out. After wearing the XM4s for a few days, I can safely say that these ULT headphones can produce a much better sound in the bass. The mids and highs are almost exactly the same to my ear. I played with the EQ from the app and tried to make them as similar as possible while listening to the same song and I prefered the sound from the ULT Wear more. Another feature that I noticed is that the ANC on the ULT wear outperformed the XM4s slightly. I had some noise pass through the XM4s while noise cancellation was on so that was a little disappointing and the ambient sound feature made the noise that passed through sound very robotic. After comparing this to the ULT Wear, I found the ANC feature surpasses the XM4s and blocks out more noise even without having music playing. The ambient sound feature also did not distort the noise that was passed through. A small but noticable detail that I appreciated. As far as the looks of both i think they look great. The XM4 have more premium materials that make up the headphones and a softer leatherette that makes up the ear cups. The XM4s sit more comfortably on the head and were not as tight on my head as the ULTs but only slightly. The ULTs do have a nice build but the XM4s do have the edge in that aspect. However this doesnt affect its performance. The ULTs I think are a solid choice for the price especially when compared to the XM4s and Beats Studio Pros. TLDR: ULT Wears over the current flagship models because the quality of sound is the same but the bass is better and the ANC is much better than the XM4s. Quality is good for its price point. ULT>XM4s>Beats Studio Pro', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones have literally made my ADHD easier to deal with. I can focus much easier with the noise cancellation feature. Even more so with the adaptable ambient noise system. They fit extremely comfortably and can be worn in bed. The battery life is also something remarkable, providing hours of entertainment and comfort on one hour’s charge. The bass boost is next level!!! One of the best hidden features is the Bluetooth connection allowing you to switch connected devices without pairing the headphones. Would definitely purchase again!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a huge fan of over ear noise canceling headphones. I work at home, and I live in a neighborhood full of dogs who bark a lot. That and all of the landscapers, all day long. These Sony Ult Wear headphones are amazing, as expected. I also own the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones, so I’ll sort of compare the two here. First let me say how relieved I am that Sony gave these an actual name, and not just a number and letter combo. Well, there is a model number, for Sony’s use, but we don’t have to talk about that here. I never really know how to refer to my WH-1000XM4s. It’s way too long to remember and say, that’s for sure. These Ult Wears are very similar in general. For the price point, these are amazing headphones. I got the off white color, which I love. I have a ton of black gear and wear black all the time, so something other than black was more than welcome! Sony has an app that you can set up your preferences, toggle between Sony headphones, noise canceling vs. ambient sound, equalizer control, etc. The QR code for downloading is on a brief info insert in the box. The case for the Ult Wears is very similar to my WH-1000XM4s.The only thing that is missing is the nylon strap loop on the outside, which I really like. Also missing is the in-flight adapter, which I have never used, but I guess it’s nice to have. The charging cable (SB-A to USB-C) and aux cable jack is inside the case. I like that the case is flat and not bulky. With Sony design,they just do everything with extreme detail. They are very meticulous about design and prefer to minimize waste. There’s no plastic in the box, and the headphones are made of recycled material. The headphones were very easy to pair with my iPhone.The headphones have a Ult button that when pushed, it makes a boost sound or poof type sound when turned on or off. It’s pretty fun. I am not usually very good at the controls when I’m wearing headphones, but this Ult button is in a spot far enough away from the other buttons on the left side that I can do it without messing everything else up. My favorite way to use these headphones is in noise canceling mode. We have come a long way since the Walkman. Which I still have, by the way. You can connect these headphones to two different devices at the same time. This comes in handy if I’m listening to something on my iPad and I get a call on my iPhone. Something I want to mention is that when I talk on the iPhone with the headphones, nobody says that I sound far away or weird, or anything negative. The battery life is really good. I’ve had these headphones for about five days. I charged them when I first got them, and I have been wearing them and haven’t had to charge it again. In the headphone app, it shows you how much battery life is left. I still have 89% battery after the several hours I’ve used these. These headphones are comfortable. Possibly more comfortable than WH-1000XM4 for me. The headphones weigh almost the same amount though. So there you have it, a not technical review of tech gear. I really like these Sony Ult Wears and the off white color!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony ULT Wear headphones are a great choice for those who enjoy a bass-forward listening experience. With a sleek design featuring matte finishes and holographic accents, they offer a modern aesthetic that’s both understated and stylish. The comfort level is very high, thanks to the plush ear pads, though the faux leather cover may cause them to get warm after on warm days or prolonged use. Sound-wise, the headphones deliver an intense bass that can dominate the overall audio profile, potentially overshadowing mids and highs -- particularly using the highest of three ULT setting (off | on | really on) . This makes them appealing to bass enthusiasts but perhaps less so for those seeking a more balanced sound. I would say the overall sound is decent, but at times (more in some music genres than others) the bass can make the mid-range muddled. Of course, sound is quite subjective, so give these a listen. The active noise cancellation is the best I've found in a mid-range priced headphone, providing a quiet backdrop for your music. Functionality is enhanced with intuitive touch controls, although the lack of USB-C audio support is a notable omission. The battery life is commendable, ensuring long periods of uninterrupted use. Priced competitively, the Sony ULT Wear headphones are a good value, especially for users who prioritize a strong bass presence and effective noise cancellation in their audio devices. Overall, they’re a solid pick for daily use, offering premium features without the premium price.""]"

Well, here it is and I kept my word. They're VERY light and comfortable and allow you to use custom EQ settings to get exactly the sound you want. The detachable mic is good, they're loud enough (though not piercing your ears loud), and the Bluetooth connections are very solid. I'd only knock 1 star off for not having simultaneous Bluetooth and game audio, but it's not a terribly huge issue in the grand scheme of things."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Would be five stars if bluetooth and wireless were simultaneous.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The xbox edition was a good headset, although I returned it and got the turtle beach stealth pro.

Sound quality between standard and esports eq is meh at best, This headset doesn’t get loud enough especially for fps , Hard to hear footsteps. Mic quality is ok but again could be better. Very comfortable and lightweight but that’s about the only thing good about this headset. I honestly don’t understand all the 5 star reviews for this headset because for $200 it should be better. I ended up returning them. I have tried alot of different headsets and honestly the best of the best is the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro wireless hands down. I own the Steelseries arctis nova pro wireless and it easily blows the Razer out of the water. Another decent headset would be the steelseries arctis nova 5x for only $129.99 is a solid option.

I gave it four stars because I believe the volume control is too high up. I can explain. The microphonic problem always seems to persist for me, especially when I exercise, so I usually have to wrap the cord around my earlobe. However, the volume control then sits almost directly on my earlobe instead of hanging further down, which causes that side of the cord to randomly come off my ear. This is very annoying. Otherwise, the cable sounds great and feels very sturdy. I would recommend for other iPhone users.', 'Very pleased with my purchase of the ER4SR.  The performance with my favorite music - classical, new age, jazz (no rock) has been excellent.  No complaints or disappointments. Really debated about getting the ER4XR v ER4SR.  Wish I could have listened to the ER4XR to make my choice.  Will never know the audio difference. No regrets but just wonder what heightened bass on ER4XR actually sounds like.', ""I have traveled with many expense hifi headphones and earphones for many years. Always desired to hear the true and accurate sound it was meant to be. ER4SR just satisfied me perfectly. Having more bass with ER4XR gives you more warmer filled sound, but the ER4SR's bass is just right enough to listen whole dynamic range balanced to my ear."", ""I'm not really an audiophile, but I am professional video editor so I'm familiar with the requirements accuracy when I'm mixing audio for TV or other delivery systems. That being said, these are quite simply the most delicately accurate and enjoyable way to enjoy my favorite music that I've discovered yet in my 57 years on this planet. They isolate exterior noise so well, so that that you don't have to play them at full blast, and can enjoy the nuance and flavor of a recording as it was intended in the studio. To be honest that's enough for me. I play them out of an old fashioned iPod (The black one with the front dial), which is wonderful in itself, and then if I really want to bathe in luxury I'll add a good headphone amplifier, occasionally adding a little bass boost if I'm listening to music that seems to require it. But without the amp they are still wonderful. Buy them, you will not regret it you appreciate accuracy. If you need thumping bass added to your music like too much sugar, you're going to need a good amp or a different version of these. (I should add they take a little getting used to in the first week, as they go a long way into the ear canal, and you’re unused to having anything in there.)""]"

Magnetic and holds the charge well and really quick. When you put the earbuds back in the case/charger, they switch off and get charged up to full. long battery life too! Very easy to pair with a variety of different devices, controls are easy to navigate , overall a great performance , sturdy build for a high quality pair of headphones. The case/charger is beautifully designed, Small and practical, only about 6x5x2cm and fits in a pocket or handbag easily so can be taken everywhere and won't take up much space. Absolutely love this and 20 stars!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Can’t believe I never had a pair of earphones like this , the sound quality is amazing and the way they cut all noise out , didn’t know they was a app that you can download and add more bass and stuff like that they connected easy to may iPhone and really fit nice in the ear .']"

Since most brands haven't come close to the sound quality of pro 2 even after 3 years, it is refreshing to see 3 and now 4 slightly improve their sound (where as 3 focused on cleaner highs, this one has cleaned up the mids, base is same across pro 2 3 and now 4). The mic on 2 pro was as bad as everyone else, 3 made it years ahead of everyone and now with pro 4, I'm seeing that they kept the benefits of pro 3. Even without any enhanced options, people do not hear my kids screaming near me, they do not hear the tv beside me, and they do not hear the music either. They can hear me whispering even if there's is loudness around me. I don't know what magic is this, but it's been 2 years since pro 2 and I don't understand how other companies have not managed this (I'm looking at you Samsung and iPhone). If you do not use your headphones for talking, then you can probably still go with pro 2, or else pro 3. And if be you want slightly better sound and the newer one, then this one. Remember to install the app and be turn on LDAC for Android (this would half your battery life but imprint sound quality). Even if your music/ podcast/audiobook is low quality, it enhances the experience. I do not have a device to test the new standard above LDAC (and almost no one in North America will), but it does make it sad that Huawei is fully abandoning Android. At least make a tablet that will support Android and give it the new standard.""]"

The earbud then corrected that by adjusting the device. The sound they produce is amazing. I found the bass very strong and there are multiple pre-set adjustments to suit your liking. I had trouble with hearing people speaking to me while streaming content and so for me ( with minor hearing loss) the Transparency mode did not work as well as I had hoped.

The sound quality is amazing, It’s so soft. The material is so soft and the features is great. You can skip or pause by clicking with your finger. It is so comfortable and has great noise cancellation. The design is so neat and stylish it has a clean look. The best thing about it is the cup is big and it didn’t hurt my ears. But the only thing concern about is the case holder is kinda big. Yet it is stylish and neat it has a magnet inside to hold your charger. Overall i am happy with it . And highly recommend it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones are awesome. I’m a satisfied costumer. These block out all the unwanted background noise, especially my fan. The battery life is amazing to. The fit is perfect and comfortable. Great for traveling with hours on top of hours of play and talk time. You can’t go wrong with this purchase.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear headphones everyday for my job , and for fun . I have been threw alot of headphones cheap to expensive, and by far I love these. They are noise canceling, easy to use, Bluetooth, and the best part is if you move them off your ear, it automatically pauses your stuff. So no more having to stop and pause manually which helps especially for my job. I'm love they come with a really nice case, easy-to-use, and carry anywhere. You will love these . The quality alone is so good. Just love them. They last forever before you charge them. The best I say for sure. Obsessed!!"", 'I bought this headphone today and the unboxing to connecting to Bluetooth, setting up the app, to the knowing how to operate the headphone is thrilling', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. ', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has been at the top of the line for years now when it comes to Noise Cancelling Headphones, and their latest addition continues that tradition. So far my experience with the WH-1000XM5 have been excellent! UNBOXING & SETUP: - Sony has really impressed me this time around with their minimalist packaging and unboxing. Its a subtle thing but its just nice that everything is recyclable and it does not come with a bunch of extra packaging, twist ties, and plastic wrap. - Once you take them out of the carrying case, they are essentially ready to use! Just connect them to your phone / tablet / computer and you are ready to go! - Sony recommends downloading their Sony Headphone App as well, which is definitely useful. Especially since it downloads any software updates needed for the headphones in the future. PROS: - I absolutely love the refreshed design on these! The XM3 / XM4 had the same design which was fine, but the XM5’s really have a more modern sleek look to them that are a big upgrade. - I was very impressed with how light these are and how comfortable they are! Sony opted for more of a plastic feel to keep them lighter, but I don’t think it makes them feel cheap. I think it was the right choice to make to keep all day comfort in mind as well as portability. - On that note, I wore these for a long time and they were comfortable the entire time. The adjustable headband is better fitting, the ear pads are comfortable, and they are not too tight at all. - When I first put these on I was truly blown away at the Noise Cancelling. I have used plenty of noise cancelling headphones in the past, but these easily offer the best noise cancelling I have used. Instantly you are taken back by how much sound they drown out. - The Sound Quality is of course exceptional! Everything I listen to is so crisp and offers a ton of clarity. The dialogue / vocals are excellent, the bass is impactful, and everything about the music or show you listen to just feels alive. Overall I am very pleased with how great these sound. - The touch controls are once again excellent as well! You can pause, play, change tracks, change from noise cancelling to transparency mode, and if you hold your hand over the right touchpad you can quickly hear what’s going on around you which is an cool little trick. - Taking calls on the XM5’s are fantastic as well! I can tell the call quality has improved and people have told me the mics sound great on their end as well. Definitely would be really easy to use for phone calls, work meetings, or gaming as well. - Battery life is really solid too! 30 hours with ANC on, 40 without ANC, and they give you 3 hours of playback from 3 mins of charging if you are in a pinch. - Lastly, the minor details all work well too! They still offer a aux port, still charge via USB-C, and the carrying case feels premium. CONS: - I do wish these had a waterproof design for use outdoors or while working out. - The carrying case is larger than before since the headphones do not collapse/fold in, and instead just lay flat. However I still think the carrying case is really nice. BOTTOM LINE: - The Sony WH-1000XM5’s are simply the best Noise Cancelling Headphones you can buy! They offer superb Sound, Noise Cancelling, have great features, and are very comfortable! Plus Sony headphones just work with everything - Android, Apple, Windows, you name it. If you are in the market and want the best headphones possible, these are the ones to buy!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] --- SETUP --- To set up these headphones, you must download the Sony Headphones app. From there, follow the on-screen instructions to connect them via bluetooth to your mobile device. --- FEATURES --- 8 microphones for active noise canceling (ANC) exceptionality, bluetooth and auxiliary options, USB-C charge, 3 minute charge gives 3 hours of use, 4 microphones for voice precision, capacitive touch controls, auto-ambience features, and 30 hours of continuous use. --- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS --- Visually, these headphones didn’t stand out much compared to other headphones I’ve owned. In fact, they are prone to getting oily quickly and don’t scream quality at first glance. However, what it lacks visually more than makes up with its superb features. The over-the-ear cup design makes these one of the most comfortable headphones I’ve worn to date. It helps that they are light to wear and its minimalistic design makes it intuitive to use the controls available. The headband has a memory foam that lies comfortably on your head for extended periods of time. The true value of these headphones comes with the customization provided for you in the free Sony app. Within the Sony app, you can turn on several features that are unique to scenarios you may encounter. For example, these headphones come with superb ANC technology. What this means is that the embedded 8 microphones on the headphones turn on to block ambient sound around you and make your listening experience sound as if you are listening to your audio in a vacuum, allowing you to truly focus on what you’re listening to. In the app, you can turn on a feature that will automatically turn off the ANC if you start talking with someone so that you can clearly hear them. At that point, the microphones will capture the voice of the person talking to you, and you will hear them through the headphones. This is great if all you plan to do is listen to your audio. However, if you like singing along to your tunes, it doesn’t work so well. Since it’s a feature you can turn on or off, you can decide what you prefer. Similarly, if you have the auto-ambient feature off, you can still turn off ANC temporarily and quickly with the intuitive touch-capacitive controls. Place the palm of your hand on the right ear cup and your music will automatically fade and ANC will turn off, allowing you to listen to what you need to listen to. Imagine being on a subway and you need to hear the stop. This would be an ideal use of the quick ANC turn-off feature. The headphones also detect when you remove them. Doing so, it pauses what you are listening to, including watching shows from a streaming service. This is a feature that I enjoyed more and more because it’s just practical. The headphones feature 360 Reality Audio. For it to work, you need to take pictures of your ears within the app, the pictures are sent to a Sony server to be analyzed, and in return, you get a personalized 360 audio experience with specific apps. Some require a subscription. However, you can try the feature with the free 360 Reality Audio. I followed instructions and set up my personalized audio experience with the 360 Reality Audio app. I listened to the audio before and after the analysis of my ears. I personally didn’t find a difference, but the sound of the headphones is enjoyable nonetheless. --- VALUE --- These headphones have the right amount of well thought out bells and whistles that are useful, practical, and easy to understand to justify their price. --- APPROVAL --- I highly recommend the headphones for the person who considers themselves an audiophile, the student who wants no outside disturbance while studying, or for the person who simply wants the best audio combined with the best comfort for extended periods of time!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right out of the box I was so excited to pair these Sony WH-1000XM5 with my iPhone 13 Pro. Simply need to put it into pairing mode and it was ready within seconds. Download the Sony Headphones app from the App Store and my headphones were ready to be used to the fullest. The technology that Sony has paired into this set of headphones is impressive. Noise-canceling on this pair of headphones is impressive. I can't hear much of any external noise when I'm around noisy environments. Working from home I can't hear the cooling fan, external speaker, or vacuum when the noise canceling is active. Even more impressive is the sound quality on phone calls or online web meetings. I had my music speaker on 40% volume during a phone call and the other party couldn't hear my music, as only my voice was making it through to them. Sony has crafted a pair of smart headphones with advanced technology built into them. One QN1 noise-canceling processor paired with the Integrated V1 processor can really cancel out the background commotion. There are a total of eight microphones that are actively monitoring external noise to give you the best audio experience as a headphone user. Inside the ear cups are 30mm drivers that do an exceptional job at sound quality for crisp high notes and deep bass notes as well. With the app, you can easily fine-tune the sound preference which suits your hearing best. There is built-in AI in the form of DSEE Extreme to help upscale compressed digital music files to ensure that I'm getting a full experience for my music of choice. Four beamforming microphones on this pair of headphones are designed to capture your voice in full clarity and precision. Hands-free operation is possible with the touch interface that can be turned on/off through the app. The right ear cup allows for volume and music controls for example. These particular headphones also have the ability to pause your music when you start to speak so you can converse when needed, and this feature can be turned on/off via the app. Also depending on your movements, the ANC will adjust in case you're moving around your home or various locations, and this feature took me some getting used to but can be turned on/off via the app. Alexa is also built-in and can be activated if you choose to. Pair these Sony headphones easily to two devices at the same time, which has been helpful for listening to music from my iPhone and then connecting to my Windows laptop for a virtual meeting. There is a nice hardshell case that comes with these to help protect this luxury set of headphones. Also included in the case is a 3.5mm gold plate L-shape audio wire so you can listen to your headphones with a wired connection if you choose to. Also, there is a USB-PD cable for charging purposes. Battery life is stated to be up to 30 hours of total play, and you can get a 3-hour charge in just 3 minutes with the provided USB-PD compatible AD adapter. The overall fit of these headphones is really nice. I can wear these for long periods of time without feeling discomfort. The pads are large and soft with the leather encircling your ear in full. The headphones are adjustable with nice smooth and quiet movement across the headband, without clicking to set a place on your headband size. The look and design of these headphones are very upscale and minimalistic which I like because I don't want to be flashy with branding and attract attention with my headphone choice. For me, this has been a great set of headphones so far for home usage and while commuting. They offer incredible noise cancellation and truly are one of the best sets I have ever used. The style is elegant and upscale. This is a luxury set of headphones meant for use in stationary settings and multi-tasking. I would not recommend using these for any exercise or precipitation weather, since there is not an IPX rating. PRO: Noise-canceling technology is top-notch The style looks really nice Sony app offers many options to maximize the headphones All-day comfort CON: Cautious to use while exercising due to lack of IPX rating""]"

I would absolutely recommend these headphones if you’re a gamer or even just work from home and need something comfortable you can wear all day!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always love Razer products so it’s no surprise how much I like these! Everything you need is in the box! Charger, mic, Bluetooth adapter and usb-c adapter, so no need to worry if they will connect to your device! This completely eliminates the issue of having to go back to the store to make your product work which is super annoying. I’m really happy with the sound quality of these headphones as well. The lay nice and flat like, which I think is a great design feature. Additionally, they are metal inside, (I included a pic) so these are very sturdy, and built to last, so you likely won’t need new headphones for a long time! These deserve 10 stars! I noticed their was a review left saying that you can’t see which side the mic works on, but you can! It’s labeled on the mic with a little symbol!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Maybe because its one of their lower end headsets but after a month of using it the volume dial started having issues to where it stopped working in general overall and the cuchion for the headband started to peel off after a week . My assumption is because its been on sgelf for so long that the glue or whatever they use for it started to get weak.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Barracuda X is an awesome value for a great quality, comfortable headset. Using with Android, Switch or PS4 is also pretty seamless. I really loved the Barracuda X with my Switch - being able to use them wirelessly is a lot more flexible, and you can always use the included 3.5mm cable to plug them in if you need to charge at the same time. The microphone can be disconnected if you don’t plan on using it but, the sound quality is exceptional. As far as the microphone, people say they can hear me just fine, so i assume it works well too. When playing competitive shooters, I was able to tell what direction gunfire and footsteps were coming from with them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The packaging was amazing and beautiful.The instructions are clear and concise. Overall headphones fit and wear beautifully. The Razer Barracuda X has a unique version of connectivity. It does not use Bluetooth. It uses a USB C dongle that instantly connects. I can switch that between my Galaxy, my PS4, my switch and my PC - just by moving the dongle to the new device. (On the PC I also have to change the sound output in settings). If I want to use it on my iPod I Can use the 3.5mm analog cable in wired mode. The headphones controls are easy to understand and use- for volume and answering calls. The surround sound is excellent, allowing me to get more kills in FPS matches I use my headphones for music listening as well, and enjoy marathon Spotify sessions with excellent clarity and dynamic sound response. The Bass is clear and the highs are solid. The mic is awesome. It only picks me up, which is great. My little sister is always busting in my room trying to say hello to my team or crack a joke about me getting sniped - They cant hear it. They can hear me however- and that makes for better matches and more wins.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’d give this headset less than one star if possible. This was my first headset-away from Logitech and I’m unimpressed and the warranty is useless for a defective product. Less than 3 months old and the think is broken just through daily use for work. Broke in the exact same spot on both sides. I’ve seen others with the same issue since experiencing this myself. Razer says they don’t cover physical issues on their products.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] as a headset it works reasonable well as far as the sound quality. Mic was not the greatest. Biggest problem was that the right ear piece starting breaking free from the head piece almost immediately. The outside panel that above the u shaped connector that holds the earpiece was not properly aligned to the headpiece. Every time it moved, it caught and then popped free from the swivel joint. After about 2 weeks of use there was a slight crack in it and it stopped popping. Since then it has gotten larger and larger. Now it has failed completely and the earpiece just dangles. The whole thing is so damaged I can't figure any want to fix it."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is excellent! I love the clear feedback from the headset and the microphone allows me to have clear conversation with my team mates with amazing noise suppression. 10/10 recommend !']"

The combination of form-fitting pads and breathable material provides the most comfortable headset to wear. The mic is a good size and adjustable.

Absolutely great product!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the Best quality, Comfortable, Clear sound headset I have used. They are very comfortable on ears and head, the memory foam padding is soft & good quality. Its light weight. They fit very well and do not cause discomfort after using even for longer period, I used about 5 hours continuous. Sound is very crisp and clear I can hear each sound clearly and can differentiate the sound of everything. Mic performance is good, and it is detachable. The volume knob on the side is also very convenient. Battery life is good. It has noise cancellation effect; while playing I don’t like to be disturbed and this headset fairly cancels surrounding/external noises. No doubt this is my favorite among others. Love playing games wearing this headset. I have done meetings with it as well. One drawback, the foam padding is not replaceable, so better take care and keep it clean. This headset enhanced my gaming joy a lot. The clear sound quality plus the comfort of this headset is worth the price.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great quality, very comfortable on the head and ear, adjustable and good sound', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Blackshark V2 Pro is a great product. The build quality is solid and doesn’t creak when moving or adjusting. I’ve used it on both Macbook and Windows PC and the performance is awesome. It achieves a good sound quality for both microphone and headphones It does have a slightly looser fit, so it doesn’t get uncomfortable while wearing glasses. Adjustable volume dial and mute buttons are nice features that are easy to determine state or engagement without needing to use the headphones. They are comfortable around the ears and on top of the head, headset feels solid and not fragile. I also like the dedicated volume control knob on the left ear cup, wich is the best volume control experience I’ve had on a gaming headset. It offers a good, passive noise isolation and can completely immerse you in the game, music, or movie.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great Headset, Super Clear Microphone But For Some Reason The Plastic Piece That Holds The Headset Together Chipped Off After A Few Days Of Wearing.. Other Than That No Complaints At All.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro headset is by far the best value for money spent I have ever owned. The microphone is absolutely crystal clear and picks up on very small voice inflections with ease. However, it also picks up background noise as though it's right up against the microphone so be sure to keep that in mind when recording or playing live. I have caught my childrens voices being recorded 4 rooms away with doors closed between myself and them. The speakers deliver very clear audio with accurate spatial sound and absolutely zero echo. The headphones themselves are incredibly comfortable on the ears and head. I have often suffered headaches or outer earaches due to lack of headphone comfort and these are a refreshing change. As of now, I have used these headphones for a total of about 20 hours (all on the inital charge, straight out of the box) and they are nowhere near needing a charge, nor have they caused any physical discomfort at all. It was so easy to connect them to my PS5 that it doesnt warrant any explanation besides a 2 year old could do it. Overall, I am completely impressed with every aspect of this product and will now end my search for the perfect headphones because I have found them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are absolutely amazing. The highs mids and lows are insane. They obviously have these downpat . Light on the head, but comfortable to use. They don't smash down hard on your ears. To me very comfortable. The bass hits hard with these also. Great sound can hear all the enemies before they see you."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent Mic, subpar audio with average build quality. Titanium Drivers are solid, definitely not the best around this range, but they are solid. Microphone is alright, for a headset it surpassed most of the ones I've tried before, but will never compare to a cardioid dedicated mic. Build quality is above average, earcups are uncomfortably at long sessions. These are good if you catch them on sale, they work in consoles as well, but the console versions are updated and fixed per device, I ended up buying the ps5 version and boy I love it way more than the pc versions.""]"
Sony WH-CH520 On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones w/ Microphone - Cappucino,$69.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wh-ch520-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-w-microphone-cappucino/19265640/review,"['I bought this product this year precisely 13th March 2023, and it has been so good to me. Very lovely output and notice cancellation. I love it and recommending it for all', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-CH520 really are a great pair of Headphones with some great features too. They are 'on-ear' rather than over ear headphones and I found they're lightweight and comfortable to wear on the ears. The padding inserted underneath the headband also helps with comfort. The first thing I have to mention is the sound quality. The sound quality is excellent, particularly when used with the Sony Headphones Connect App with the various modes, audio settings and equalisers available in there. It's also possible for you to switch DSEE on and off in the app too. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine acts as an upscaler for your music but it's not meant to be used with High-Resolution Audio files (which don’t need upscaling). I have been really impressed by the battery life. I'm still on the original charge after 4 days of use. They have a reported battery life of up to 50 hours and they also give you the option to have a quick 3 minute charge that gives you 90 minutes power. This is a handy feature, especially for commuting / travel. The Multipoint Connection enabling you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same is excellent. I was able to connect to my Laptop and phone at the same time and the call quality was clear too. General Bluetooth connections to other devices such as the TV was also easy. These really are a great pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price bracket."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones are an upgrade to my older Sony Headphones. They arrived in a nice smaller package and all paper based. The headphones are light and not intrusive whilst wearing them. There’s a lot to like but somethings I am not too sure on. The likes: The soft material used for the ears and the head are super soft and so much better than my previous ones. Charging is quick under 10 mins first time but let’s see when I drain it. It says you can charge for 3 min and get 1 and half hours play. The controls are the same as my previous ones so it was easy and quick to set up. Bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone is quick a en easy. The sound: they may not be noise cancelling but I feel the sound is super clear. You can change the EQ via the iPhone but the Sony Headphone app allow you to use a differ EQ which is more controllable I think. You can also connect to a 360 Reality Sound service giving a sound system like you are surrounded by the band and signers. Perfect for gaming and watching TV in the evening when everyone has gone to bed. Be warned! If you watching a horror or tense film it can be a rather shock when a sound jumping moment comes through. Bass and treble are controllable and some nice settings available depending on what you are listening to. Cost it’s much cheaper than I expected to be. I suffer from tinnitus and time to time I would stick on the headphones and it helps a bit. The Dislikes: At first I thought the headphones were tighter on me than my previous ones. (Note: it seems to be a bit better after wearing them for a while) Bluetooth connectivity was a bit harder on my Sony TV but easier on my IPhone. 360 reality audio : you have to pay for it. Instructions; I wish they were printed bigger but I then found them online so not so much of a dislike but a niggle. Overall: I wanted to give 5 stars but the only thing I found was holding it back was was cost of 360 Reality audio service but then I think it is unfair to do this as it’s not Sony charging for it. Quality for a value for money product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cans that can When I knew I was getting these headphones I knew exactly where they’d fit in my life, they’d replace an aging set of Sony non-noise cancelling on-ears that get more abuse and neglect than they should. I use them when buds will likely fall out and I don’t want to wear or risk either of my over ear N/C sets. But… read on… Pros Sound: clear unprocessed and balanced. Build: feels robust, creak free, positive click for adjusting headband Design: look good in black. Nice simple design, discreet classy Sony logo. Battery: yet to not be told it’s fully charged after over a week of use. Price: list price is on the money, gvfm. Cons Maybe a transport bag would be nice, but adding plastics and associated costs that may not get used is a balance. Short usb cable. USB C still arguably in roll out stages but surely we’ve all got access to longer ones. Not the best for phone calls No water resistance Unboxing Fully recyclable box packaging that opens in a series of simple layers. Effective and uncomplicated. We’ve all experienced packaging that seems designed to make getting to the contents like an encryption test. This is pleasingly straightforward. The only wrapping I don’t think is trickier to recycle is the protective wrapper around the headphones. Set up From breaking the seal to listening I would say under 5 minutes. I’ve already got the Sony headphone app, but simple QR code scan from inside the second layer box lid and that’s it. Good to go. Listen without prejudice I had music playing on some smart speakers as I was getting these ready, I put the headphones on, pressed play and… “noise cancelling”. No there is none. But maybe it’s my ear fit or head size but the music left playing on the speakers in the same room was reduced to background that didn’t interfere with the headphone output. *update* having had these for a week and listening in various situations, some noises cut straight through (think transparency on N/C phones) but I’m still impressed with their ability to isolate sound. How do they sound. I can’t claim to be an audiophile, but I have 2 N/C headphones (one an old Sony set I keep toying with replacing) and 4 N/C earbuds of various brands and price points. I also have wired buds and a Sony in-ear pair I use for work. Plus my previously mentioned “quick and dirty” Sony on-ear. These are so much better than the old set, I can honestly say I rechecked the model number. I listen to predominantly vocal based music but also dance and R&B. They sound superb, especially for the list price. Sizing and build I’ve got a relatively large head, but the clamping isn’t too severe. The padding seems to be the same as my old N/C set. It’s soft and the pu leather feels substantial. Nothing creaks and the cushioning on the headband is decent. Nice and light, with a smaller size, they are easy to chuck into a kit bag/rucksack. Summary At this price point, with few bells and whistles, the sound “feels” fuss free. I listened back to back with my N/C Sonys. Yes, the older but significantly more expensive sounded better, but I’ve found I pick these up and use them as they’re light to wear and I enjoy the open feeling of the music. Being lightweight, good value for money they’re a perfect grab and go set that sound far better than they should. No hesitation in recommending.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-CH520 is an entry-level offering from Sony, and yet they still deliver that great Sony sound you expect from the company. Some of the key features of this model are excellent battery life, quick charging and multi-device connection. The headphones come in an eco-friendly, sustainable, plastic-free box with documents and a USB-C charging cable. Unfortunately, there is no case but that is expected from this price point, however, a cloth pouch would have been a nice inclusion. The headphones are incredibly light but still feel pretty durable. Both the headband and earpads feel like they are made of memory foam, the earpads in particular are very comfortable and are easy to wear for long sessions. Initially, it looks as though there isn’t enough padding on the headband, when wearing them however, I felt there was just enough which made them fine for longer listening sessions. On the right earcup, you'll find the power/pairing button, volume/change track buttons, LED indicator, USB-C port and the built-in mic. All are well placed and I found operating the headphones fairly natural. Features Setting up the CH520s was easy, once paired, the Sony Headphones app allows you to customise the equaliser and play around with the settings. The CH520s allow you to connect to 2 devices simultaneously; this is a new, must-have feature for me as it allowed me to listen to music whilst working on my laptop and as soon as a call came on my phone, I could answer it using the headphones without disconnecting and reconnecting my devices. Call quality was decent, not something I would describe as crystal clear, however, I had no complaints from anyone I was on the phone to. The battery life is claimed to be up to an astonishing 50 hours. However, from my use, I think they were probably slightly less, but still very impressive. The only feature I would have liked from Sony is support for their own LDAC Bluetooth codec for higher bitrates, however given the price point of these headphones, I think it is understandable to exclude this feature. They do however support AAC which produces good great sound quality. Sound quality The first thing that should be done with these headphones is connect them to the Sony Headphones app and customise the equaliser to your preference. Another setting worth turning on is DSEE (Sony's upscaling technology to help get even more quality from your sound). At this price point, I wasn't sure what to expect from the sound, especially when I am used to Sony's flagship headphones, however, the CH520s left a surprisingly good impression on me. Firstly, the volume is loud enough that I didn't need to leave the headphones on the max volume the whole time; and even at max volume, there is no noticeable distortion in the sound quality. I can see that with these, the main focus is good sound quality. The Bass was excellent, thick and clear, there was no muddiness to the bass whatsoever. The mids are also excellent for the price point as they were clear, and the separation was also very good. I wouldn't say these are bass-heavy headphones, but the bass is delivered in a really enjoyable way, there is definitely some power to the bass, however, it is not over the top. The highs are where these headphones struggle very slightly (although this is just the audiophile in me nit-picking). Whilst both male and female vocals are clear, I would say that at the very high end, I just get a sense that these headphones are struggling slightly and there is a lack of clarity. But again, given where these headphones sit in Sony's range, I think the sound quality is great and you still get some of what Sony is best at. Conclusion Overall, these headphones surprised me with how capable they are in terms of sound quality, they definitely have that great Sony sound quality. I would definitely recommend these headphones for the price point; especially for children as they are light and seem fairly durable while still offering good audio quality. They also make excellent home office headphones as they are light and comfortable enough to be worn for hours, have excellent battery life and can connect to 2 devices at the same time."", ""Great headphones. The sound quality is fantastic it picks out parts that you don't really notice when using various types. The hands free operation make them an all rounder for use and when talking the quality is good. Noise cancelling is Very good.

I’m not usually a fan of on-ear headphones, but these are very comfortable and light weight, you forget you’re wearing them after a few minutes. The 50 hour battery life is a fantastic feature on such an affordable pair of headphones. The sound quality is excellent with very sharp vocals and deep bass, especially when listening to 360 Spatial Audio. In the app you can also turn on the DSEE to further enhance the sound if needed. On the right ear cup you’ll find the on/off and volume up and down buttons, there’s also a microphone for making hands free phone calls or using a voice assistant (Siri. Alexa. Etc.)

The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) is a great plus too have. These headphones may not have all the features but it does have the most important ones. These Sony Bluetooth headphones are very affordable and with a battery life of around 50 hours on a full charge I was happy to listen all day too a variety of music and podcasts. The headphones deliver a nice balance between bass, mids and treble with excellent detail especially after activating DSEE. At this price the audio these headphones deliver is remarkably good and is further enhanced by the use of the Sony Headphone App. to tweak the EQ. This can be downloaded from the App Store. The headphones despite the cushioning are lacking in noise-blocking and they do not have active noise cancellation so if you commute a lot bear that in mind. The shell of the headphones are textured plastic but feel really well made. You have buttons at the bottom of the right-hand shell for play/pause, volume control and track skipping and if you double-press the play button it triggers your phone’s voice assistant. The CH520 support Bluetooth multi point pairing, so you can rapidly switch between your phone, laptop for a video call etc. The connectivity is very reliable and I never experienced any problems. The battery life of 50 hours is excellent they charge via a USB-C cable. There’s no 3.5 mm jack option so bear that in mind if you want to use them on a flight. The Sony WH-CH520 has a microphone which is functional. Overall an excellent product that offers brilliant sound for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.']"

Luckily, I know my nieces would love to try them and afterall, I’m Uncle Brian and have all the fun stuff. Annie is super delicate with things so I knew they would be fine for her. Her sister Rylee is also known as “distructo” as things don’t last long around her. I was surprised to see how tough these headphones were when they were both taking turns trying them out. “I can use them with my DJ box!,” Rylee exclaimed as she ran out of the room to fetch her musical instrument to try the headphones with. Once she returned, I attempted to show them how to connect them and in return, I got the “I know how to do it, Uncle Brian.” Kids these days, right?

"Audeze Maxwell Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox, PS, Mac, & PC",$446.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/audeze-maxwell-wireless-gaming-headset-for-xbox-ps-mac-pc/18896045/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] these headphones are not normal, they have a magnetic metal plate speaker system, they completely reduce the distortion of a conical speaker. They definitely sound like studio headphones, I bought the version for xbox with doubly atmos included, it is worth it, the best of the best, they feel top quality, I would have liked to bring option for ambient sound, but it is compensated by the audio quality, you can not insure them with bestbuy I could not explain why, but if they have 2 years warranty directly with the factory.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First thing is the packaging. These things are PACKED in there. I’d say there is a near-zero chance they are damaged from shipping as it’s got foam on every side and nothing can move freely in the box (see picture). Second is setup. Simple enough to plug and play, but if you’re buying this set over the PS5 version it’ll be because this has embedded Dolby Atmos. I’m on PC, so for Windows all I had to do was download Dolby Access on the Windows Store. IMPORTANTLY, on Windows 10 at least, right click the volume button on the lower right corner of the desktop and click “Spatial Audio” then click Dolby Atmos. The included instructions are simple (see picture, good) but can also be a bit vague (bad). Two wheels on the side, one is for overall headphone volume, the other is the ratio between “game” volume and “chat” volume. In my case I could turn either my game volume down to hear my friends on Discord, or turn Discord down to hear my game. Neat feature, kinda confusing with no initial explanation. Build quality is very nice with seemingly high quality materials. This makes it a good bit heavier than my previous headphones, however. Ear cups out of (pleather?) make a great seal that is soft, which helps with immersion, but the great build quality pushes in on my ears quite a bit. There isn’t any standoff room between the ear cups and the base of the headphone, so I found my admittedly large ears getting smushed against the side, which is a bit uncomfortable. The head strap is again high quality, but adjusting it makes you use a screwdriver (see picture). This is of course better than it being fixed in place, so I’m not complaining much, but food for thought for gen 2. The only real sore spot I have with the headphones is the detachable mic. It could be just the pair I got, but I’ve been told both in game and Discord that I sound like I’m underwater and that it sounds worse than the G430s I got quite a few years ago. I downloaded the Audra’s HQ app, updated firmware, nothing helped. Also, the mic monitoring “Sidetone” absolutely MESSED up the sound, so would not recommend turning that on. Overall, a very solid pair of headphones, especially for wireless ones! The only spot that has uncharacteristically low quality is the microphone, which apparently sounds terrible. Because they are $300 dollars, I’ll probably swap them for some other high end set unless Best Buy doesn’t sell anything worth buying. For someone who’s just watching videos or listening to music, it’s worth the money! If you need to use the mic, not so much!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Best sounding headset by a mile, nothing has come close. Heavy, but worth it. Suggest getting 3rd party band and cushions. Xbox version works fine on the PS5, so just get that one.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this headset, I'd say the only downside is the weight of it, I got used to it very quickly; and the connection when it's around other wireless dongles (like on a hub) sometimes the connections can be crossed. Audio is great, mic is good for a gaming headset, and the sound...I don't even have to say anything. King of the PC gaming headsets."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this headset. Well made, not cheap plastic, so they weigh a a little more. I have a significant hearing loss, so the eq is what made me take a closer look. The reason for 4, and not 5 stars? The mic sounds amazing, but the will not stay in place, and the controls are a little odd. Otherwise, great headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros: They are extremely customizable. The eq settings and Dolby atmos allow you to make them sound however you want. The build quality is out of this world, Holding any other headset will feel cheap after you drive these. The sound from the planar magnetic drivers is insane. The immersion in single player games and profile of music/movies make these the best of the best. Cons: I am sure if you are considering these you have done your research and know that the planar magnetic drivers are notorious for being fragile and failing. They must be treated with care. Regarding imaging, directional sound on these is not as good as other strictly gaming headsets. Not bad, but no hacks. With all that being said, these are undoubtably the best wireless gaming headset you could buy. If you have the money and are okay with the risk of fragile drivers I would easily recommend these without hesitation. However, if you are strictly a competitive FPS player maybe go to the Stealth Pros by Turtle Beach.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There’s no comparison when it comes to sound quality. The mic is good, not great. But it makes up for with amazing sound, and you will not be disappointed.

Sudio Audio A1 In-Ear True Wireless Earbuds - Blue,$24.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sudio-audio-a1-in-ear-true-wireless-earbuds-blue/17144104/review,"[""Okay, so I had 2 of these fail on me. But I feel like I'm getting more than what I bargained for here. First off, it's a pair of very cheap earbuds. So my expectations were pretty low. Second, this type of product is by design destined to be e-waste in a very short time span. So my experience is as follows: - Bought these couple of weeks before Christmas, heavily discounted, practically the price of 2 beers in a pub. - Waited for Christmas to give them to my daughter. - To her great delight (her first pair of earbuds) they worked flawlessly - And I do mean flawlessly to the extent you'd expect, they pair easily, hold charge as stated, connect to your phone instantaneously when taken out of the case. - There were no expectations when it comes to music quality, microphone quality, etc. - But a teenager used them daily for over 2 weeks At that point, one earbud failed, like completely dead. As we were at exactly 30 days, I went back to Best Buy, 5 minutes of polite conversation and I had a brand new second pair in my hands (I could've gotten a refund, but I asked for an exchange). It doesn't get any better than this. Fast forward to couple of days ago, same situation, one earbud is completely dead after about 5 months of moderate usage. Couple of emails exchanged with Sudio customer support, couple of pictures of the receipt and the headphones, and we have a brand new (upgraded) pair heading our way. Again, I cannot imagine this going any better than it did. So overall, with normal usage, these hold really well. The case didn't fall apart, the headphones look good as new, there were no connection drops, and they're quick to pair. The only problem is the electronics failing, which is completely expected from my side given that you cram a lot in such a tiny earbud, but in that case, both Best Buy and Sudio stand by their product and I couldn't be happier about my shopping experience. In today's world, I would say this is rare."", 'Sudio Audio A1 offers an exceptional listening experience through their wireless earbuds. .

HyperX Cloud Mini Over-Ear Sound Isolating True Wireless Headphones - White/Red,$59.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hyperx-cloud-mini-over-ear-sound-isolating-true-wireless-headphones-white-red/18165639/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve tested many sets of headphones/earbuds.  The criteria for these are quite different. This set it going to my 7 year old grandson.  He\'s a huge Minecrafter player.  His other grandparents live about 2 hours from their home (we call it \'the farm\'). I\'ve taken the trip with him and his brother to \'the farm\', while they both play on their tablets almost the entire trip.  The most frequent words spoken by his parents the entire trip are: ""Please turn that down"".  So not only am I getting these for my grandson, I\'m getting them for his parents.  These headphones are downsized for kid size heads. Their is really no way to make a set of headphones that fit kids and adults.  First for kids they need to be lighter and cover smaller ears. BTW it\'s not a good idea to get kids regular earbuds, most think earbuds are not appropriate until age 10-12, and only if they limit the dB output to 85dB or below.  The same is true for headphones, but headphones can\'t be inserted too deeply in the ear.  Most pediatricians recommend headphones over earbuds for younger kids. These headphones weigh about 1/2 what my over the ear headphones weigh; they weigh only 4.6oz. They come with a dropdown microphone that is turned off when raised.  The boom of the mic is bendable (not on a solid plastic boom).  And most important they can be used either wired or wireless (BlueTooth).  The headphones will last 25 hours on a single charge. They come with removable wired cable and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable.  To test them I paired them with my iPhone.  I listened to some Boston. It sounded pretty rich.  Bass was subtle and if it turned it all the way up it never got let loud (limited to 85dB), which works.  But they sound nice at that level, bass is largely missing but mids and highs sound good.  The headphones only have two buttons.  On/Off and BT mode/pause.  Pairing worked easily. Hitting the BT button once paired paused and restarted playing music. Time passed, and my grandson opened his headphone package. And without any assistance/instructions paired the headphones with his iPad and resumed his Minecrafters game. After about 30 seconds I got two thumbs up and a high five.  And the little joker quickly added I bet mom and dad like them too.  He used them for about an hour before breakfast.  He thanked me again and said he really likes them.  He wanted to know how often they need to be recharged (kids pick up this tech stuff so quickly).  Now that I have his approval I think I\'m going to get his little brother a pair of his own for Christmas, but I\'ll get the white ones for him.  I feel like this was a total success.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My 9 year old son enjoys playing some multiplayer games with his friends. In the past, he used my headphones which were just a little too big for him (but they worked). This headset is a reasonably priced one that is the perfect size for him, with lots of versatility. It’s designed to protect young kids’ ears, with a volume restriction (big plus, as I’ve known my son to jack the volume up in headsets). The only minor downside is no USB transmitter, which would have been helpful for connecting to Playstation and PC a bit easier. Of course, you can still use it via 3.5 mm connector. I, and my son, like the design of the headset. It’s plenty light, and the ear cups swivel so you can lay it flat. The microphone can twist out of the way when not in use or when you want to mute your voice chat. As a parent who knows kids can be rough with their devices/toys, etc., I have some concerns about how long it will last before a piece of plastic might break, but that’s all kid dependent. My son takes pride in his headphones and takes great care of them. But, this isn’t unlike any problem you might run into if kids treat things without the proper care, so I can’t knock it. It also probably helps keep the price down. The headband has a nice soft pad that my son tells me is comfortable (it’s too small for my big head). The ear cups are plenty plush and feel similar to the standard (i.e. non-premium) headset. In short, my son reports that they are extremely comfortable. The mic is smartly designed in so much as it’s not too long and can “flip” out of the way. The boom is flexible which allows you to move it closer/further away from the mouth and I think helps with durability (a hard, stiff, microphone might be more prone to break off). Smart design choice in my mind. While I will (sadly) admit that I don’t always think about loud volumes in my son’s ears, I certainly appreciate that HyperX has thought of it and built it into this headset. The volume level stays below 85dB which ensures that kids aren’t listening to too high of volume for a lengthy time. In terms of set up, it’s like any Bluetooth headset that we’ve all grown accustomed to. It pairs quickly and easily by holding the power button to put it in pairing mode. We’ve had no issues connecting it to a PC with Bluetooth, a phone, and Kindle laptop. He’s plugged it into the PS5 controller and it works just fine, but I wish it came with either a 3.5 mm cable (it doesn’t) or a USB dongle. I’m assuming it’s to keep the price down, but honestly my son just plays single player games on PS5 so it hasn’t been an issue for us. It’s really only a minor complaint. My son, who is no audiophile, really enjoys the sound quality. He tells me everything sounds good and offers no complaints when playing games, watching his tablet, or otherwise talking to his friends. In terms of comfort and fit, again, my son says they’re extremely comfortable. Finally, battery life. It’s rated for 25 hours which is plenty for several listening sessions over a number of days. My son, being who he is, charges it almost daily so we’ve never tested the full battery capacity, but even if it gets close to its rated hours, I’m satisfied. Importantly, the battery made it over a long drive to see family - there and back - without needing to be charged. All in all, I think this is a good value proposition. It’s a quality headset with a sharp, but not too over the top design, that’s comfortable for young kids. The limit on volume is a big plus, and while I would consider purchasing it just for my son to use during long road trips, I really like the versatility of what you can use it with (i.e. PS5, Switch, PC, tablets, phones, etc.). One kids headset to rule them all.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, these HyperX Cloud Mini Wireless Gaming Headphones are an excellent option for my 9 year old son. He uses these for gaming primarily on his Switch and iPad. They come nicely packaged with everything needed to use them. Included in the box were the headphones, USB-A to USB-C charging cable, 3.5mm headset cable (which is a good length for what we need), a fun sticker sheet, and instructions. The headphones came partially charged but we did plug them in to give them a full charge. The quality of these headphones seems very nice. Though they are mainly plastic, they are sturdy and very light weight. The ear cushions are soft and comfortable and there is a nice cushion across the headband. My son has worn these for several hours at a time and does not complain of fatigue or them being too hot around his ears. There is a “Tuck-away” Boom Mic that when it is in the up position is muted and when it’s in the down position, is on. There is a power button and a Bluetooth sync button that are easily identifiable and have a solid click when pressed in addition to an audio beep when pressed. It was very easy to connect these to our devices via the Bluetooth connection. Sound quality is nice and clear. My son says he feels like he’s in the game and can hear sounds clearly all around. When in a game chat, the voices are clear but don’t drown out the game sounds. The mic picks up his voice clearly for his friends to hear what he is saying. If using on a Switch it does require the headphone jack if you want to talk over the boom mic, though. I really like that these have a volume limit of 85dB so as not to have a bad impact on his long-term hearing. Batter life on these headphones is very nice. They claim to have a 25-hour battery life and I feel that this is fairly close to what he got out of them on a single full charge. However, if you do happen to run out of battery, you can use the supplied 3.5mm headphone jack to connect and still use them for full functionality. I think these are a really nice option for a younger gamer. The price is right so if something does happen to them, I’m not out of an expensive pair of headphones. There really isn’t anything I don’t like about these for my 9 year old gamer son.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have an 8 year old who enjoys gaming on various devices such as the Nintendo Switch, and an iPad in particular. Sometimes the sound coming from her devices can be very distracting so a set of earphones gives me the peace I need while giving her the sound to go with the screen based entertainment. These headphones are much smaller than normal ones since they are sized for youth usage, and are limited to no more than 85db to prevent hearing damage which I really appreciate. They are very simple with only a power button and a “function button” for controlling certain Bluetooth functions depending on the connected device. They swivel and the band extends an inch on either side for size adjustments. They also have a built in microphone that flips up to mute, and the only other connection points are the 3.5mm jack on the bottom and a USB-C charging port on the upper side of one of the ear cups which hides it while the headphones are in use. This port location prevents the headphones from being charged while being used which is a peculiar decision by Hyper X in my opinion. Having a child be responsible enough to plug in and charge them regularly is hit or miss. This means that if they die because they weren’t plugged in, they’re useless until they’re recharged again which can create some distress. Battery life is quite solid though at about 25 hours. Other than the charging aspect, my daughter really likes the way they feel and sound, and they’re easy to use and connect to her devices without any fuss. If you have a young gamer in your life that you’d like to give a safe comfortable option for sound and chat the HyperX Cloud Mini is a great choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset was exactly what I was looking for my son. We had had problems previously with other bigger bulkier headsets so we were looking for a smaller lightweight headset, one preferably that didn't break the bank. The Hyper-X Cloud mini satisfied all the requirements, and I'm actually surprised at how much he likes it. He has all the fancy accessories for his computer, like keyboard, mouse and speakers and he was perfectly fine with these. Build quality, from a normal sized persons perspective might seem a little fragile, and they may be. The headset is almost entirely plastic, and what feels like thin plastic. This I believe is to make it more lighter weight and it works. This is an extremely light headset. The ear muffs feel a little on the cheap side, but my son says they are really comfortable. I couldn't fit it on my head, so I don't have an opinion. The head cushion at the top is comfortable, but where my son has any criticism is its not wide enough, so if its settled on his head, the plastic to the left or right of the cushion gets uncomfortable after a while. The mic is a little small, but it fits a child just fine. He often uses the mute functionality of it by pushing the boom up to talk to me or his mother when we walk in the room. The headset doesn't get very loud which is a blessing because I don't want my son cranking the sound up and ruining his hearing. He thinks its plenty loud enough which is good. He also says the sound quality is good. Hes only 9, so we probably have different opinions on sound quality, but then again, hes happy with them. They connect wireless with the PC via bluetooth which I found to be the only real drawback of these. I don't like using BT with PC due to latency issues. But, somehow, these have no noticable audio latency when being used via BT which was surprising. Hes able to use them just fine watching his shows or playing his games and states there isn't a lagging audio problem. That said, I do wish they had 2.4 wireless capability. The battery life on them is good. Even on all day play sessions with his friends, the battery doesn't die. He plugs them in when hes done for the day, and puts them back on in the morning. Hes never had the headset die or get low in a single days use. All in all, I'd say these are a great affordable option for kids. Good quality and affordable."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The hyper X mini is the perfect headset for children or smaller people. There are not very many headsets on the market that are specifically created for gaming and children. When you unbox you get the headset, a USB charging cable, 3.5mm optional wired connection, and some Hyper X stickers. This headset uses USB-C charging which is convenient because it can use the same charger as just about other peripherals. They are easy to connect via Bluetooth and are rated at 25 hours of battery life. The best part about these headphones are the compatibility. They can connect to any game system, phone, tablet, or computer. My son is always asking to use my headset but they do not fit well on his head, the Hyper X mini are the perfect size for him. My son is 6 years old and on the smaller side. These are the perfect headset for anyone with a small head. They are adjustable and can easily fit a small kid up to a teenager. They are made from lightweight and comfortable materials. For the price these are a great headset for a kid who loves gaming. The boom microphone is a great added feature that can be flipped up to mute. That was one of my sons favorite features when we were on FaceTime…These are the perfect gift for the young gamer.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have 4 gamers in my house with the youngest one having just turned 9. They play on the XBOX or on their gaming laptops so when there are 4 different devices gaming the sounds are mind numbing. I got these so the youngest has her one pair of gaming headphones and so far she has been happy. They looked exactly as pictured and were easy to connect via Bluetooth to her gaming laptop. It also came with a 3.5mm cable to plug into her tablet or could be used with a PC or Laptop if preferred instead of Bluetooth. The audio is clear and she has enjoyed using them to play Roblox or watch Your Tube. She has worn them for multiple hours at a time without any complaints and the battery life so far has been impressive. They charged quickly the one time I have had to charge them and so far the only complaint my daughter has had is how short the microphone is. Pros - Good battery life and charges quickly - Comfortable for long hours of gaming - Good size and fit for smaller kids who like to game - Limited volume so they aren't listening too loudly Cons - Smaller than I expected even for a kids pair of headphones - Microphone is shorter than expected Overall for my 9 year old they have worked well for her to game on her laptop without my wife or I having to listen to her games or You Tube videos."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My son needed a pair of gaming headphones after his current headset broke. As he is getting older, I was looking around for a 2 in 1 and I have found that with the Hyper X Cloud Mini. This review is mostly from the perspective of my eleven-year-old son just so that you who is reading my review will understand. My son spends his time switching between electronic devices. He is usually on his Chromebook, cellular phone or his X-box. These headphones are “amazing” as he calls them because they have Bluetooth, and a wired connection so it can be used with all his devices even if the battery runs out. Pairing his Chromebook & Cellphone was a breeze and using the included 3.5mm cable made it easy to use when he is playing his games, He has charged it twice since he has had as most of the time he is wired. He likes the fact that the microphone can be muted simply by tucking away, he plays Roblox and other games on his X-box and he wears them nearly 24/7 because he will listen to music when his downtime is on for gaming. For the next year or two these should fit him just fine until it is time to get him a bigger pair, but these are perfect kid gamers who do not want a simple wired headset this is a little more than that in my son’s eyes. Got him this for his birthday and he can’t stop going on about how much he loves them. Here is what I like about them as a parent, they are Bluetooth and a regular pair of headphones. I personally am familiar with the brand and the fact that Hyper X makes headsets that’s kid sized and kid friendly is a plus in my book and it is practically universal. It will not break the bank either so you can spend more on games or Robux or whatever your child is into.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My experience using HyperX Cloud Mini Wireless Gaming Headset has been great. My son was excited to finally use this headset. He likes the color and comfort of this headset. Only complaint is it could be a bit larger in size, the display photo shows a larger sized headset. The sound quality is great and it’s easy to connect to the gaming controller.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a great pair of headphones!

Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music.

It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. ', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has been at the top of the line for years now when it comes to Noise Cancelling Headphones, and their latest addition continues that tradition. So far my experience with the WH-1000XM5 have been excellent! UNBOXING & SETUP: - Sony has really impressed me this time around with their minimalist packaging and unboxing. Its a subtle thing but its just nice that everything is recyclable and it does not come with a bunch of extra packaging, twist ties, and plastic wrap. - Once you take them out of the carrying case, they are essentially ready to use! Just connect them to your phone / tablet / computer and you are ready to go! - Sony recommends downloading their Sony Headphone App as well, which is definitely useful. Especially since it downloads any software updates needed for the headphones in the future. PROS: - I absolutely love the refreshed design on these! The XM3 / XM4 had the same design which was fine, but the XM5’s really have a more modern sleek look to them that are a big upgrade. - I was very impressed with how light these are and how comfortable they are! Sony opted for more of a plastic feel to keep them lighter, but I don’t think it makes them feel cheap. I think it was the right choice to make to keep all day comfort in mind as well as portability. - On that note, I wore these for a long time and they were comfortable the entire time. The adjustable headband is better fitting, the ear pads are comfortable, and they are not too tight at all. - When I first put these on I was truly blown away at the Noise Cancelling. I have used plenty of noise cancelling headphones in the past, but these easily offer the best noise cancelling I have used. Instantly you are taken back by how much sound they drown out. - The Sound Quality is of course exceptional! Everything I listen to is so crisp and offers a ton of clarity. The dialogue / vocals are excellent, the bass is impactful, and everything about the music or show you listen to just feels alive. Overall I am very pleased with how great these sound. - The touch controls are once again excellent as well! You can pause, play, change tracks, change from noise cancelling to transparency mode, and if you hold your hand over the right touchpad you can quickly hear what’s going on around you which is an cool little trick. - Taking calls on the XM5’s are fantastic as well! I can tell the call quality has improved and people have told me the mics sound great on their end as well. Definitely would be really easy to use for phone calls, work meetings, or gaming as well. - Battery life is really solid too! 30 hours with ANC on, 40 without ANC, and they give you 3 hours of playback from 3 mins of charging if you are in a pinch. - Lastly, the minor details all work well too! They still offer a aux port, still charge via USB-C, and the carrying case feels premium. CONS: - I do wish these had a waterproof design for use outdoors or while working out. - The carrying case is larger than before since the headphones do not collapse/fold in, and instead just lay flat. However I still think the carrying case is really nice. BOTTOM LINE: - The Sony WH-1000XM5’s are simply the best Noise Cancelling Headphones you can buy! They offer superb Sound, Noise Cancelling, have great features, and are very comfortable! Plus Sony headphones just work with everything - Android, Apple, Windows, you name it. If you are in the market and want the best headphones possible, these are the ones to buy!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] --- SETUP --- To set up these headphones, you must download the Sony Headphones app. From there, follow the on-screen instructions to connect them via bluetooth to your mobile device. --- FEATURES --- 8 microphones for active noise canceling (ANC) exceptionality, bluetooth and auxiliary options, USB-C charge, 3 minute charge gives 3 hours of use, 4 microphones for voice precision, capacitive touch controls, auto-ambience features, and 30 hours of continuous use. --- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS --- Visually, these headphones didn’t stand out much compared to other headphones I’ve owned. In fact, they are prone to getting oily quickly and don’t scream quality at first glance. However, what it lacks visually more than makes up with its superb features. The over-the-ear cup design makes these one of the most comfortable headphones I’ve worn to date. It helps that they are light to wear and its minimalistic design makes it intuitive to use the controls available. The headband has a memory foam that lies comfortably on your head for extended periods of time. The true value of these headphones comes with the customization provided for you in the free Sony app. Within the Sony app, you can turn on several features that are unique to scenarios you may encounter. For example, these headphones come with superb ANC technology. What this means is that the embedded 8 microphones on the headphones turn on to block ambient sound around you and make your listening experience sound as if you are listening to your audio in a vacuum, allowing you to truly focus on what you’re listening to. In the app, you can turn on a feature that will automatically turn off the ANC if you start talking with someone so that you can clearly hear them. At that point, the microphones will capture the voice of the person talking to you, and you will hear them through the headphones. This is great if all you plan to do is listen to your audio. However, if you like singing along to your tunes, it doesn’t work so well. Since it’s a feature you can turn on or off, you can decide what you prefer. Similarly, if you have the auto-ambient feature off, you can still turn off ANC temporarily and quickly with the intuitive touch-capacitive controls. Place the palm of your hand on the right ear cup and your music will automatically fade and ANC will turn off, allowing you to listen to what you need to listen to. Imagine being on a subway and you need to hear the stop. This would be an ideal use of the quick ANC turn-off feature. The headphones also detect when you remove them. Doing so, it pauses what you are listening to, including watching shows from a streaming service. This is a feature that I enjoyed more and more because it’s just practical. The headphones feature 360 Reality Audio. For it to work, you need to take pictures of your ears within the app, the pictures are sent to a Sony server to be analyzed, and in return, you get a personalized 360 audio experience with specific apps. Some require a subscription. However, you can try the feature with the free 360 Reality Audio. I followed instructions and set up my personalized audio experience with the 360 Reality Audio app. I listened to the audio before and after the analysis of my ears. I personally didn’t find a difference, but the sound of the headphones is enjoyable nonetheless. --- VALUE --- These headphones have the right amount of well thought out bells and whistles that are useful, practical, and easy to understand to justify their price. --- APPROVAL --- I highly recommend the headphones for the person who considers themselves an audiophile, the student who wants no outside disturbance while studying, or for the person who simply wants the best audio combined with the best comfort for extended periods of time!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right out of the box I was so excited to pair these Sony WH-1000XM5 with my iPhone 13 Pro. Simply need to put it into pairing mode and it was ready within seconds. Download the Sony Headphones app from the App Store and my headphones were ready to be used to the fullest. The technology that Sony has paired into this set of headphones is impressive. Noise-canceling on this pair of headphones is impressive. I can't hear much of any external noise when I'm around noisy environments. Working from home I can't hear the cooling fan, external speaker, or vacuum when the noise canceling is active. Even more impressive is the sound quality on phone calls or online web meetings. I had my music speaker on 40% volume during a phone call and the other party couldn't hear my music, as only my voice was making it through to them. Sony has crafted a pair of smart headphones with advanced technology built into them. One QN1 noise-canceling processor paired with the Integrated V1 processor can really cancel out the background commotion. There are a total of eight microphones that are actively monitoring external noise to give you the best audio experience as a headphone user. Inside the ear cups are 30mm drivers that do an exceptional job at sound quality for crisp high notes and deep bass notes as well. With the app, you can easily fine-tune the sound preference which suits your hearing best. There is built-in AI in the form of DSEE Extreme to help upscale compressed digital music files to ensure that I'm getting a full experience for my music of choice. Four beamforming microphones on this pair of headphones are designed to capture your voice in full clarity and precision. Hands-free operation is possible with the touch interface that can be turned on/off through the app. The right ear cup allows for volume and music controls for example. These particular headphones also have the ability to pause your music when you start to speak so you can converse when needed, and this feature can be turned on/off via the app. Also depending on your movements, the ANC will adjust in case you're moving around your home or various locations, and this feature took me some getting used to but can be turned on/off via the app. Alexa is also built-in and can be activated if you choose to. Pair these Sony headphones easily to two devices at the same time, which has been helpful for listening to music from my iPhone and then connecting to my Windows laptop for a virtual meeting. There is a nice hardshell case that comes with these to help protect this luxury set of headphones. Also included in the case is a 3.5mm gold plate L-shape audio wire so you can listen to your headphones with a wired connection if you choose to. Also, there is a USB-PD cable for charging purposes. Battery life is stated to be up to 30 hours of total play, and you can get a 3-hour charge in just 3 minutes with the provided USB-PD compatible AD adapter. The overall fit of these headphones is really nice. I can wear these for long periods of time without feeling discomfort. The pads are large and soft with the leather encircling your ear in full. The headphones are adjustable with nice smooth and quiet movement across the headband, without clicking to set a place on your headband size. The look and design of these headphones are very upscale and minimalistic which I like because I don't want to be flashy with branding and attract attention with my headphone choice. For me, this has been a great set of headphones so far for home usage and while commuting. They offer incredible noise cancellation and truly are one of the best sets I have ever used. The style is elegant and upscale. This is a luxury set of headphones meant for use in stationary settings and multi-tasking. I would not recommend using these for any exercise or precipitation weather, since there is not an IPX rating. PRO: Noise-canceling technology is top-notch The style looks really nice Sony app offers many options to maximize the headphones All-day comfort CON: Cautious to use while exercising due to lack of IPX rating""]"

The packaging was excellent and the headphones came in a nice bag, there was also a cutout and build model of the monster mascot Lars which was a funny but nice touch. The headphones were super easy to set up and I was using them in under a minute. For my ps4, all I needed to do was plug the transmitter into the usb to female usb-c adapter then plug that into my console, change the audio device output to the headphones and that was it. My only minor gripe is that the headphones don't automatically detect when they're on or off and effect the audio channel accordingly but I imagine that's because they're designed to work primarily with Xbox. I wore them for a solid 4 hours straight and they didn't become uncomfortable at all, like other headsets I've had. They also don't squeeze your head too much which, as a glasses wearer, can often be an issue. My favourite feature has to be the microphone, which is on a retractable stalk you pull out of the headset itself. So cool!

They are great quality. It comes with all the accessories needed in the box to use these. I like the versatility of them because they can be used with XBOX, PC, & Playstation. I use both XBOX & PC so these work for both. In fact, they work with my phone also, by just using the audio cable provided in the box. These headphones are heavyset and durable. They are really comfortable to wear with thick padded and puffy earpieces that cover and overlap my ears. The head strap adjusts and fits nicely as well without slipping. I can wear these for hours. This set comes with an extra battery, so when the battery is running low, I just swap it out in the base without stopping my game. The sound quality is beyond good. It’s clear and you can hear all of the details while playing. These are noise canceling too. The wireless feature is great. They connect to the base via Bluetooth. These come with a wide range, so I can move around while wearing these and still stay connected. The microphone is retractable and gives clear communication on the other line. I like the dust bag that comes with this set too because it’s well made, and easy to put the headset in & pull closed to keep them clean. I would recommend them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Firstly I would like to say a massive thank you to #influenster and #steelseries. I recently received this headset for free in exchange of my honest review from Influenster and Steel Series. So well packaged, displayed lovely. This headset is absolutely amazing! Soon as my husband placed on the headset he couldn't believe how comfortable they was. Needed no adjustments at all. Not only are they so comfortable but also have a extra battery placed inside the headset. The battery life lasted him about 2 days. The volume and mic are amazing also. Really clear, no disruption at all. Amazing quality when playing in action games. The noise cancellation was another massive hit for my husband. Couldn't hear nothing from outside of the headset. Absolutely worth every penny for the premium sound you receive. Really pleased with how they preform. The headset is very light weight. Comes with a dust bag for protection. They look absolutely amazing! Very sleek and expensive. Was rapidly quick to set up! Basically plug in the control system and play! It really couldn't be any simpler. One of my husbands favourite things about the head set is that the microphone is on a retractable cord, which comes out of the headset itself. I love the fact how you can use these wireless and with or without the microphone. I really can't recommend these enough! If you are a serious gamer, then you need this headset! It's a massive 10/10 from us and we hope these last forever. Definitely one to recommend to all gamers.""]"
Sony WH-CH520 On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones w/ Microphone - Pink,$69.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wh-ch520-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-w-microphone-pink/19265639/review,"['I bought this product this year precisely 13th March 2023, and it has been so good to me. Very lovely output and notice cancellation. I love it and recommending it for all', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-CH520 really are a great pair of Headphones with some great features too. They are 'on-ear' rather than over ear headphones and I found they're lightweight and comfortable to wear on the ears. The padding inserted underneath the headband also helps with comfort. The first thing I have to mention is the sound quality. The sound quality is excellent, particularly when used with the Sony Headphones Connect App with the various modes, audio settings and equalisers available in there. It's also possible for you to switch DSEE on and off in the app too. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine acts as an upscaler for your music but it's not meant to be used with High-Resolution Audio files (which don’t need upscaling). I have been really impressed by the battery life. I'm still on the original charge after 4 days of use. They have a reported battery life of up to 50 hours and they also give you the option to have a quick 3 minute charge that gives you 90 minutes power. This is a handy feature, especially for commuting / travel. The Multipoint Connection enabling you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same is excellent. I was able to connect to my Laptop and phone at the same time and the call quality was clear too. General Bluetooth connections to other devices such as the TV was also easy. These really are a great pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price bracket."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones are an upgrade to my older Sony Headphones. They arrived in a nice smaller package and all paper based. The headphones are light and not intrusive whilst wearing them. There’s a lot to like but somethings I am not too sure on. The likes: The soft material used for the ears and the head are super soft and so much better than my previous ones. Charging is quick under 10 mins first time but let’s see when I drain it. It says you can charge for 3 min and get 1 and half hours play. The controls are the same as my previous ones so it was easy and quick to set up.

Summary At this price point, with few bells and whistles, the sound “feels” fuss free. I listened back to back with my N/C Sonys.

Being lightweight, good value for money they’re a perfect grab and go set that sound far better than they should. No hesitation in recommending.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-CH520 is an entry-level offering from Sony, and yet they still deliver that great Sony sound you expect from the company. Some of the key features of this model are excellent battery life, quick charging and multi-device connection. The headphones come in an eco-friendly, sustainable, plastic-free box with documents and a USB-C charging cable. Unfortunately, there is no case but that is expected from this price point, however, a cloth pouch would have been a nice inclusion. The headphones are incredibly light but still feel pretty durable. Both the headband and earpads feel like they are made of memory foam, the earpads in particular are very comfortable and are easy to wear for long sessions. Initially, it looks as though there isn’t enough padding on the headband, when wearing them however, I felt there was just enough which made them fine for longer listening sessions. On the right earcup, you'll find the power/pairing button, volume/change track buttons, LED indicator, USB-C port and the built-in mic. All are well placed and I found operating the headphones fairly natural. Features Setting up the CH520s was easy, once paired, the Sony Headphones app allows you to customise the equaliser and play around with the settings. The CH520s allow you to connect to 2 devices simultaneously; this is a new, must-have feature for me as it allowed me to listen to music whilst working on my laptop and as soon as a call came on my phone, I could answer it using the headphones without disconnecting and reconnecting my devices. Call quality was decent, not something I would describe as crystal clear, however, I had no complaints from anyone I was on the phone to. The battery life is claimed to be up to an astonishing 50 hours. However, from my use, I think they were probably slightly less, but still very impressive. The only feature I would have liked from Sony is support for their own LDAC Bluetooth codec for higher bitrates, however given the price point of these headphones, I think it is understandable to exclude this feature. They do however support AAC which produces good great sound quality. Sound quality The first thing that should be done with these headphones is connect them to the Sony Headphones app and customise the equaliser to your preference. Another setting worth turning on is DSEE (Sony's upscaling technology to help get even more quality from your sound). At this price point, I wasn't sure what to expect from the sound, especially when I am used to Sony's flagship headphones, however, the CH520s left a surprisingly good impression on me. Firstly, the volume is loud enough that I didn't need to leave the headphones on the max volume the whole time; and even at max volume, there is no noticeable distortion in the sound quality. I can see that with these, the main focus is good sound quality. The Bass was excellent, thick and clear, there was no muddiness to the bass whatsoever. The mids are also excellent for the price point as they were clear, and the separation was also very good. I wouldn't say these are bass-heavy headphones, but the bass is delivered in a really enjoyable way, there is definitely some power to the bass, however, it is not over the top. The highs are where these headphones struggle very slightly (although this is just the audiophile in me nit-picking). Whilst both male and female vocals are clear, I would say that at the very high end, I just get a sense that these headphones are struggling slightly and there is a lack of clarity. But again, given where these headphones sit in Sony's range, I think the sound quality is great and you still get some of what Sony is best at. Conclusion Overall, these headphones surprised me with how capable they are in terms of sound quality, they definitely have that great Sony sound quality. I would definitely recommend these headphones for the price point; especially for children as they are light and seem fairly durable while still offering good audio quality. They also make excellent home office headphones as they are light and comfortable enough to be worn for hours, have excellent battery life and can connect to 2 devices at the same time."", ""Great headphones.

They are 'on-ear' rather than over ear headphones and I found they're lightweight and comfortable to wear on the ears. The padding inserted underneath the headband also helps with comfort. The first thing I have to mention is the sound quality. The sound quality is excellent, particularly when used with the Sony Headphones Connect App with the various modes, audio settings and equalisers available in there. It's also possible for you to switch DSEE on and off in the app too. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine acts as an upscaler for your music but it's not meant to be used with High-Resolution Audio files (which don’t need upscaling). I have been really impressed by the battery life. I'm still on the original charge after 4 days of use. They have a reported battery life of up to 50 hours and they also give you the option to have a quick 3 minute charge that gives you 90 minutes power. This is a handy feature, especially for commuting / travel. The Multipoint Connection enabling you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same is excellent.

Bose QuietComfort Ultra Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Lunar Blue,$449.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-lunar-blue/18189367/review,"[""I received my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in color: White Smoke and am very impressed by the sleek and stylish lightweight design with only two buttons: Multi-Function/Bluetooth buttons and a volume strip, where you can easily swipe up or down to adjust volume, all located on the right side of the earcup. The headphones are padded nicely around head and ears and provide exceptional comfort level after several hours of wear. I work from home and live in town where it can get pretty noisy during the day, so really needed a pair of good noise cancelling headphones to drown out the noise of the traffic and such. My favorite starred setting when working is Quiet Mode which provides exceptional Acoustic Noise Cancelling, and I found that my production increased due to being able to concentrate more on my work by not hearing all the distracting noises that entail with working from home. When I'm not working, I love to watch movies and listen to music with my Bose surround sound system, and glad that I can easily switch between devices and pair my new headphones with my sound bar as this especially helps when it's late at night and don't want to disturb or wake others. My favorite setting for movies and music is Immersion Mode which takes it to another level of complete bliss where the music literally wraps you up and sweeps you away! I'm so impressed with the quality of sound, it's so crisp and clean! The Bose app. is a must for set-up since there's no paper manual provided. There are so many cool features, tips, and shortcuts available in the app. to where you can customize your headphones to your liking and needs, such as the Equalizer (EQ) where you can add more or less Bass & Treble. I like that I can be listening to music and able to receive phone calls, which pause my song and then resume playing after my call. Very cool and convenient Sleep/Wake features, where the headphones automatically go into sleep mode when I take them off and then wake up when you put them on, and automatically powers off after 24hrs. of inactivity all while saving battery life. There are some things to be mindful of, such as the recommended safe handling suggests placing your hands around the middle of each earcup when removing from and putting back in case as this helps keep fingers away from the hinges, so they don't get pinched. It is also not recommended to use headphones near water or moisture of any kind and to clean with a dry cloth only! I knew that Bose would have the best pair of headphones available that would meet my needs and expectations and beyond, and they have always been my number one choice and have been very happy with all their products that I've purchased over the years. Bose also has exceptional and knowledgeable customer service agents to help with all your needs and concerns. I highly recommend these headphones and all Bose products to friends, family, and to all music lovers out there! There's no comparison when it comes to Bose, they are simply the best!"", 'I love sound and technological innovations small and large because greatness isn’t in just one thing… it’s in everything even the ordinary.

QC ULTRAS are a complete game changer and a must have for sound aficionados. QC ULTRAS gives you a front row seat why evolution is necessary in all facets of life if you are in the pursuit of true undeniable greatness… this headset is in my opinion epitomizes Bose’s exemplary sound quality and is their crowning achievement to date. Wore the QC ULTRAS for like two hours straight and felt like I never had anything on my ears at all even though I know for certain I did and since then I’ve worn them multiple times for even longer and feel like I could wear them 10 hours straight easy with little to no ear fatigue along with the lightness of the headset itself. Did a light workout with the QC ULTRAS and the performance was stellar and I felt zoned in on my workout in a real way but where the QC ULTRAS truly excel is in leisure and wearing walking around all day or laying down all day. The aware setting is out of this world game changing. I can hear the wind blowing, my portable electric air pump pumping my tire and I just had a full conversation in Walmart at Customer Service about electric cars and gasoline cars… the funny thing about it is the attendant was initially like you can’t even hear us can you sit and I was like these the new Bose QC ULTRAS so I can hear everything y’all saying… and to be able to say that out loud is a game changer in and of itself and was just unreal because I really could hear everything they were saying. It’s even clearer for me now after my third ownership of a Bose product why Bose is the best in the sound game in my opinion. I was able to talk to two people at once and fully engage with them in their conversation and add to it all while getting my customer service needs meet and all while still listening to music… Now that’s dope and something that a person like myself who highly values portability and versatility doesn’t take for granted.', ""Just a little background about me first. I'm a consumer who enjoys a clean and balanced sound stage (no over exaggerated lows mids or highs) when using over ear headphones or in ear buds for the purpose of enjoying different genre's of music. I listen to music often at home, while traveling, and when I'm at work. I'm not specifically an audiophile but one can enjoy a great sounding headphone with amazing features! The new Bose QC Ultra's is now my new favorite headphones. Let me explain why... Upon unboxing you're immediately drawn to the exceptional quality of the case that houses the QC Ultra's. The white smoke color in this headphone looks stunning and premium in appearance. They feel light and comfortable upon trying them on. The leather on the headband and over ear cups are thick and feel plush and can be worn for hours without feeling fatigued. I work in a laboratory setting and I've worn them for 4 to 5 hours at a time and never felt the headband pinching around my ears as well as never feeling sweaty with them on for hours. Now for the sound stage and features... So with every sense of the word phenomenal... I really think Bose hit the nail dead on with the QC Ultra's in my opinion. Once connected via wireless Bluetooth I started listening to various genre’s of music that I enjoy listening to from Rock (Foo Fighters) , Rap (Dre, Snoop, Eminem), Reggae (Bob Marley), R&B, Jazz, Metal (Metallica), and hits from the 80’s to the present day. The initial sound out of the box seems neutral and clean with a precise and pronounced separation. There is an option to adjust a basic EQ setting within the Bose app to your sound preference if you prefer a bump or distinction to your lows, mids or highs. The noise cancellation in the QC Ultra headphones are in the elite/god tier noise cancelling category as they are superior to my Sony XM's, Beats, or Apple air pod pro 2nd gen. They just seem to block out external sound the best in comparison to the other headphones I own when I want to drown out the environment around me! There was two additional features that truly surprised me... First , the immersive audio is amazing to hear and experience with every genre of music I listened. It made me hear my music in a way that resembled a concert or live experience bringing the music to life. It’s the only way I prefer to listen to music when using the QC Ultra’s. 2nd, the transparency mode or what Bose calls awareness mode is very good and is on even ground with the AirPod Pro which for several years had the best transparency feature. The awareness mode in the QC Ultra’s sound balanced and natural while listening to the external environment around me or carrying a conversation while using them. Just a couple of minor cons for me… Since I prefer to use them with immersive audio in use, this feature does drain the battery a bit faster as I’m able to use them on and off at home and work for a couple of days before needing to top of with a recharge. Bose claims approx 18 hrs which is respectable and that is roughly about the same amount of hours I was able to obtain before needing a recharge. It would have been amazing to get another 8 to 10 hrs of battery life while using immersive audio. Also, there are times I’m unable to physically answer a call or play and pause a track since it requires to physically press a button within the headphones. I work in a laboratory while wearing a lab coat, face shield and gloves and my only option is to remove one glove to use the headphones if I’m interrupted while working. It would be a game changer if Bose added a basic gesture or voice recognition feature to pause/play music or answer/end a call hands free as a future feature. Overall impression… The QC Ultra’s are very impressive in every aspect with premium sound and top tier level features! They feel comfortable and look sleek with a high end quality build. Bose has a winner with the release of the QC Ultra’s and I’ll be happily using and endorsing them to family and friends who are looking for a premium headphone! You cannot go wrong with these…. Breathtaking immersive audio sound with top tier noise cancelling and transparency/awareness features! My collection of headphones have grown and these will be the ones I’ll be reaching for the most! Great job Bose!"", 'Incredible Sound, Incredible Comfort, and Incredible Features/Technology. These headphones are everything you would expect from Bose and much more. There is so much to say about these headphones, but I don’t want to make my review so long that you don’t read it. (Smile) I will try to give you what I think are the most important reasons to make you consider buying them if you are in the market for headphones. I measure 3 most important things when it comes to deciding whether headphones meet my standards and are worth the money it cost to buy them. Those three things are: Sound quality, how comfortable they are to wear for long periods of time, and how useful the features/technology are/is in terms of making my usage experience better. Great technology that doesn’t make the headphones sound better and easier to use is almost pointless in my opinion. I work from home and work 12 to 14 hours a day, I sell Engineering Software, meaning I am on Microsoft Teams/Zoom video calls/Meetings, and traditional phone calls all day with Engineers and their Managers. When I am not talking, I like to listen to music as I work, mostly Jazz. I live for great music, and consider myself a bit of a music aficionado, and or audiophile if you will. So quality reproduction of the music as the artist intended for us to hear it is very important to me. I have had these headphones on my head each day for at least 16 to 17 hours when I combine my usage for work with my personal usage after work, and I can honestly say that the fit is the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn. The cushioning is light while around your ears, yet durable feeling at the same time. The battery life lives up to the claims and beyond, which is a very good quality, you can really get your daily long hours use out of them. The fact that the headphones can be connected simultaneously to two devices using the Bose Music App is a great feature for me because I can be listening to music from my phone or through Alexa and also be connected to my work laptop and have the ability to switch between them seamlessly, the technology built into the headphones automatically stops the music and answers a phone call or video call on my laptop, then resumes the music when I end the call. Additionally, any number of other Bluetooth Devices can be quickly connected with a toggle within the Bose Music App as well, creating quick and easy connections to all of your devices. The noise cancellation is second to none. Nothing going on around me can be heard by people on the other end of the call, moreover, also making the sound that you hear flawless without the intrusion of outside noise. The buttons have a very good tactile feel and are simple and easy to use, not overly complicated to access the many functions. A simple one, two or three click to maneuver through songs and/ or pause while listening to music, or a quick click to answer or end a call. It also has a small slightly recessed area to slide your finger either up or down to adjust the volume. Honestly, these are good improvements over the touch/feel of maneuvering through things with the other headphones and earbuds. The most important feature of the headphones is how GREAT the music sounds. I own the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones, Quiet Comfort Earbuds, and QC Earbuds II, so my bar for sound quality is pretty high. These New Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones take the sound quality of the music to the next level with the addition of Immersive Audio this feature makes you feel that the music is all around you with depth, it is the closest reproduction to Live music being played right in front of you or all around you I have ever experienced. The one and only thing that I dislike about this feature is that the Bass doesn’t seem to have the exact same punch as when this feature is off. I am truly splitting hairs here trying to find something to dislike about this feature when compared to the regular sound. I hope I have given you some important Pros as to make for compelling reasons to consider purchasing these headphones. Quite honestly, I had to search for things to dislike about these headphones and didn’t want to create some small things just to have some dislikes/Cons to make my review “seem” more balanced. I have a very high bar when it comes to justifying spending money on headphones, and these Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones pass with flying colors! I will continue to use these for hours and hours a day and be sure to add to my review in order to be as helpful as possible to those that may be considering purchasing these headphones. As of now, I would highly recommend purchasing these headphones. These are the S-Class of Bose Headphones, for sure!', 'I bought this a month ago and I love this product so much.', ""I've had these headphones for about a week but I wasn't impressed with them as another pair I own. Technologically they are amazing. I took these to the office and really noticed the amazing features. In quiet mode I thought it wasn't all that great until I took the headphones off and realized all the background noise I was able to hear. The air conditioner, people typing, paper shuffling around, etc. It was fantastic! Plus they are probably one of the most comfortable pair of over the ear headphones I have worn. I wore them all day at work and barely noticed them. Not to mention that they were at 60% battery life and they lasted through a full day of music, podcasts, and conference calls. The immersive sound is really incredible and the different settings are great. The Bose app could be a little better designed but it's pretty straight forward. I love the ability to connect it to multiple devices at once. That really came in handy at the office when I was able to connect it to my phone for music and my laptop for calls. Sounds quality is obviously exceptional. It's a Bose and they don't disappoint. My only gripe would be the price point. I have another morbid confectionery branded pair where I feel the sound is as good if not slightly better with bass. If you have the money definitely snag these for the technology alone. I am still very satisfied. After all, they're Bose."", ""I jumped from the QC25 to the new QC Ultra headphones and it doesn't get any better than this. With the QC25 you had to slide the power button from OFF to ON or to the right in order to enable Bluetooth. Now, the QC Ultra headphones have a push button (no slide), making it easier and you can avoid leaving them ON for some time. The performance is outstanding, with the 3 modes: Aware, Quiet, and Immersion. 1) Aware lets surrounding sounds in so you know what's going on while listening to the stereo audio. 2) Quiet is your brand Bose regular noise cancellation mode. 3) Immersion is the best feature for me: full noise cancellation plus Motion. You can move or be still and the audio experiences changes depending on your movement... just amazing! You can even create your custom modes with the app, making it a more personalized experience."", 'It has only been a week since I got these headphones for my husband, and he cannot stop raving about it. He made me tried them on too, and I am seriously thinking of getting another pair for myself (in the sandstone color). Here are a few things to note: Pros: - Excellent sounds quality and noise cancellation - Comfortable fit, can keep on for a few hours (e.g., trans-Atlantic flight) and your eyers do not get uncomfortably warm - Able to connect to multiple devices and easy toggle between devices (have connected this to my iPhone, surfacePro, MacAir laptop, as well as my LG OLED TV) - Immersive Audio feature with head-tracking enhances experience Cons: - High price tag - Had some initialization issues when connecting to phone (see attached pictures), but was resolved later - Immersive audio mode drains battery Overall, this is a huge upgrade from the QC 45 headphones as well as the QC II earphones', 'I love the immersive feature the most about these headphones. It really makes the music standout and seems as if you’re listening to a surround sound system. My favorite is immersive audio with quiet mode and I can listen to salsa music, alternative, and classical music. With instrumental music the sound is exceptional. The design is different but the buttons are easier to use and remember than the QC45. The headphones are comfortable and don’t ever hurt your head or feel too tight. I do have to take them off every couple of hours to scratch my ear which I think is normal. The immersive feature I would not recommend using in public so that you can be aware of your surroundings. You can use immersive in aware and it still sounds great with your surroundings. The bass is a lot stronger than prior Bose headphones when you play around with the EQ settings. Overall, the spatial audio immersive feature and the increased bass make these headphones worth it.', ""So i was really excited to open my new Bose headphones and I wasn't disappointed. The headphones are packaged in very good quality box which was what i expected for the price range of these headphones. Connecting the device was straight forward. Once switched on the headphones found my mobile easily and i was able to downlaod the Bose app to run through the very straight forward tutorial. The headphones have very sophisticated touch controls on the sides that eneable you to change the volume and settings whilst wearing the device. The headphones are very comfortable to wear, I used these whilst working, jogging and relaxing and my experience wasnt hindered by my activity. Now the best bit, the sound quality is amazing, the app allows you to select the sound experience you want, i tested them all and was amazed at the difference of each setting. Its down to your preference. I would highly recommend these headphones. I have previously used high end headphones and these are are a touch above the rest. You will not be disappointed.""]"
Sony WH-CH520 On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones w/ Microphone - White,$69.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wh-ch520-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-w-microphone-white/16703137/review,"['I bought this product this year precisely 13th March 2023, and it has been so good to me. Very lovely output and notice cancellation. I love it and recommending it for all', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-CH520 really are a great pair of Headphones with some great features too. They are 'on-ear' rather than over ear headphones and I found they're lightweight and comfortable to wear on the ears. The padding inserted underneath the headband also helps with comfort. The first thing I have to mention is the sound quality. The sound quality is excellent, particularly when used with the Sony Headphones Connect App with the various modes, audio settings and equalisers available in there. It's also possible for you to switch DSEE on and off in the app too. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine acts as an upscaler for your music but it's not meant to be used with High-Resolution Audio files (which don’t need upscaling). I have been really impressed by the battery life. I'm still on the original charge after 4 days of use. They have a reported battery life of up to 50 hours and they also give you the option to have a quick 3 minute charge that gives you 90 minutes power. This is a handy feature, especially for commuting / travel. The Multipoint Connection enabling you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same is excellent. I was able to connect to my Laptop and phone at the same time and the call quality was clear too. General Bluetooth connections to other devices such as the TV was also easy. These really are a great pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price bracket."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones are an upgrade to my older Sony Headphones. They arrived in a nice smaller package and all paper based. The headphones are light and not intrusive whilst wearing them. There’s a lot to like but somethings I am not too sure on. The likes: The soft material used for the ears and the head are super soft and so much better than my previous ones. Charging is quick under 10 mins first time but let’s see when I drain it. It says you can charge for 3 min and get 1 and half hours play. The controls are the same as my previous ones so it was easy and quick to set up. Bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone is quick a en easy. The sound: they may not be noise cancelling but I feel the sound is super clear. You can change the EQ via the iPhone but the Sony Headphone app allow you to use a differ EQ which is more controllable I think. You can also connect to a 360 Reality Sound service giving a sound system like you are surrounded by the band and signers. Perfect for gaming and watching TV in the evening when everyone has gone to bed. Be warned! If you watching a horror or tense film it can be a rather shock when a sound jumping moment comes through. Bass and treble are controllable and some nice settings available depending on what you are listening to. Cost it’s much cheaper than I expected to be. I suffer from tinnitus and time to time I would stick on the headphones and it helps a bit. The Dislikes: At first I thought the headphones were tighter on me than my previous ones. (Note: it seems to be a bit better after wearing them for a while) Bluetooth connectivity was a bit harder on my Sony TV but easier on my IPhone. 360 reality audio : you have to pay for it. Instructions; I wish they were printed bigger but I then found them online so not so much of a dislike but a niggle. Overall: I wanted to give 5 stars but the only thing I found was holding it back was was cost of 360 Reality audio service but then I think it is unfair to do this as it’s not Sony charging for it. Quality for a value for money product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cans that can When I knew I was getting these headphones I knew exactly where they’d fit in my life, they’d replace an aging set of Sony non-noise cancelling on-ears that get more abuse and neglect than they should. I use them when buds will likely fall out and I don’t want to wear or risk either of my over ear N/C sets. But… read on… Pros Sound: clear unprocessed and balanced. Build: feels robust, creak free, positive click for adjusting headband Design: look good in black. Nice simple design, discreet classy Sony logo. Battery: yet to not be told it’s fully charged after over a week of use. Price: list price is on the money, gvfm. Cons Maybe a transport bag would be nice, but adding plastics and associated costs that may not get used is a balance. Short usb cable. USB C still arguably in roll out stages but surely we’ve all got access to longer ones. Not the best for phone calls No water resistance Unboxing Fully recyclable box packaging that opens in a series of simple layers. Effective and uncomplicated. We’ve all experienced packaging that seems designed to make getting to the contents like an encryption test. This is pleasingly straightforward. The only wrapping I don’t think is trickier to recycle is the protective wrapper around the headphones. Set up From breaking the seal to listening I would say under 5 minutes. I’ve already got the Sony headphone app, but simple QR code scan from inside the second layer box lid and that’s it. Good to go. Listen without prejudice I had music playing on some smart speakers as I was getting these ready, I put the headphones on, pressed play and… “noise cancelling”. No there is none. But maybe it’s my ear fit or head size but the music left playing on the speakers in the same room was reduced to background that didn’t interfere with the headphone output. *update* having had these for a week and listening in various situations, some noises cut straight through (think transparency on N/C phones) but I’m still impressed with their ability to isolate sound. How do they sound. I can’t claim to be an audiophile, but I have 2 N/C headphones (one an old Sony set I keep toying with replacing) and 4 N/C earbuds of various brands and price points. I also have wired buds and a Sony in-ear pair I use for work. Plus my previously mentioned “quick and dirty” Sony on-ear. These are so much better than the old set, I can honestly say I rechecked the model number. I listen to predominantly vocal based music but also dance and R&B. They sound superb, especially for the list price. Sizing and build I’ve got a relatively large head, but the clamping isn’t too severe. The padding seems to be the same as my old N/C set. It’s soft and the pu leather feels substantial. Nothing creaks and the cushioning on the headband is decent. Nice and light, with a smaller size, they are easy to chuck into a kit bag/rucksack. Summary At this price point, with few bells and whistles, the sound “feels” fuss free. I listened back to back with my N/C Sonys. Yes, the older but significantly more expensive sounded better, but I’ve found I pick these up and use them as they’re light to wear and I enjoy the open feeling of the music. Being lightweight, good value for money they’re a perfect grab and go set that sound far better than they should. No hesitation in recommending.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-CH520 is an entry-level offering from Sony, and yet they still deliver that great Sony sound you expect from the company. Some of the key features of this model are excellent battery life, quick charging and multi-device connection. The headphones come in an eco-friendly, sustainable, plastic-free box with documents and a USB-C charging cable. Unfortunately, there is no case but that is expected from this price point, however, a cloth pouch would have been a nice inclusion. The headphones are incredibly light but still feel pretty durable. Both the headband and earpads feel like they are made of memory foam, the earpads in particular are very comfortable and are easy to wear for long sessions. Initially, it looks as though there isn’t enough padding on the headband, when wearing them however, I felt there was just enough which made them fine for longer listening sessions. On the right earcup, you'll find the power/pairing button, volume/change track buttons, LED indicator, USB-C port and the built-in mic. All are well placed and I found operating the headphones fairly natural. Features Setting up the CH520s was easy, once paired, the Sony Headphones app allows you to customise the equaliser and play around with the settings. The CH520s allow you to connect to 2 devices simultaneously; this is a new, must-have feature for me as it allowed me to listen to music whilst working on my laptop and as soon as a call came on my phone, I could answer it using the headphones without disconnecting and reconnecting my devices. Call quality was decent, not something I would describe as crystal clear, however, I had no complaints from anyone I was on the phone to. The battery life is claimed to be up to an astonishing 50 hours. However, from my use, I think they were probably slightly less, but still very impressive. The only feature I would have liked from Sony is support for their own LDAC Bluetooth codec for higher bitrates, however given the price point of these headphones, I think it is understandable to exclude this feature. They do however support AAC which produces good great sound quality. Sound quality The first thing that should be done with these headphones is connect them to the Sony Headphones app and customise the equaliser to your preference. Another setting worth turning on is DSEE (Sony's upscaling technology to help get even more quality from your sound). At this price point, I wasn't sure what to expect from the sound, especially when I am used to Sony's flagship headphones, however, the CH520s left a surprisingly good impression on me. Firstly, the volume is loud enough that I didn't need to leave the headphones on the max volume the whole time; and even at max volume, there is no noticeable distortion in the sound quality. I can see that with these, the main focus is good sound quality. The Bass was excellent, thick and clear, there was no muddiness to the bass whatsoever. The mids are also excellent for the price point as they were clear, and the separation was also very good. I wouldn't say these are bass-heavy headphones, but the bass is delivered in a really enjoyable way, there is definitely some power to the bass, however, it is not over the top. The highs are where these headphones struggle very slightly (although this is just the audiophile in me nit-picking). Whilst both male and female vocals are clear, I would say that at the very high end, I just get a sense that these headphones are struggling slightly and there is a lack of clarity. But again, given where these headphones sit in Sony's range, I think the sound quality is great and you still get some of what Sony is best at. Conclusion Overall, these headphones surprised me with how capable they are in terms of sound quality, they definitely have that great Sony sound quality. I would definitely recommend these headphones for the price point; especially for children as they are light and seem fairly durable while still offering good audio quality. They also make excellent home office headphones as they are light and comfortable enough to be worn for hours, have excellent battery life and can connect to 2 devices at the same time."", ""Great headphones. The sound quality is fantastic it picks out parts that you don't really notice when using various types. The hands free operation make them an all rounder for use and when talking the quality is good. Noise cancelling is Very good. The cushioned ear pieces make them very comfortable to wear, the headband is also cushioned and adjustable for size.. with these headphones it's very easy to loose yourself while listening to the quality sound that is 360° . Battery life is great given up to 50 hrs on full charge, or you can give it a fast charge of just 3mins that gives you an 1.5 HR of listening if needed or you forgot to charge before using. With voice assistance and a headphone that gives you a multi - point connecting. Touch controls on right hand side of earpiece. USB C cable charging cable included."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the best headphones I've tried! very light, nice sound (as you expect from Sony) Noise suppression tech - awesome, you can't hear any outside noise and you can answer a call (touch of the button) even if your phone is in another room without any problem. and one more thing! Gym tested, they don't fall off your head and because they're super light, you forget you're wearing them. I recommend this headphones without a doubt!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-CH520 Headphones are excellent and reasonably priced. Setting up is very easy, just download the Sony Headphone app and follow the on screen instructions. To connect Bluetooth, just press and hold the on / off button to put into pairing mode. I’m not usually a fan of on-ear headphones, but these are very comfortable and light weight, you forget you’re wearing them after a few minutes. The 50 hour battery life is a fantastic feature on such an affordable pair of headphones. The sound quality is excellent with very sharp vocals and deep bass, especially when listening to 360 Spatial Audio. In the app you can also turn on the DSEE to further enhance the sound if needed. On the right ear cup you’ll find the on/off and volume up and down buttons, there’s also a microphone for making hands free phone calls or using a voice assistant (Siri. Alexa. Etc.) The headphones come with a charging cable but no protection case/pouch. Great Headphones, Great Price, Definitely Recommended.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very versatile,light in weight,the sound quality is excellent especially with 360 surround sound .

They also have an excellent battery life."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony WH-CH520 headphones are super value for money. They are well made and comfortable to wear. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) is a great plus too have. These headphones may not have all the features but it does have the most important ones. These Sony Bluetooth headphones are very affordable and with a battery life of around 50 hours on a full charge I was happy to listen all day too a variety of music and podcasts. The headphones deliver a nice balance between bass, mids and treble with excellent detail especially after activating DSEE. At this price the audio these headphones deliver is remarkably good and is further enhanced by the use of the Sony Headphone App. to tweak the EQ. This can be downloaded from the App Store. The headphones despite the cushioning are lacking in noise-blocking and they do not have active noise cancellation so if you commute a lot bear that in mind. The shell of the headphones are textured plastic but feel really well made. You have buttons at the bottom of the right-hand shell for play/pause, volume control and track skipping and if you double-press the play button it triggers your phone’s voice assistant. The CH520 support Bluetooth multi point pairing, so you can rapidly switch between your phone, laptop for a video call etc. The connectivity is very reliable and I never experienced any problems. The battery life of 50 hours is excellent they charge via a USB-C cable. There’s no 3.5 mm jack option so bear that in mind if you want to use them on a flight. The Sony WH-CH520 has a microphone which is functional. Overall an excellent product that offers brilliant sound for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.']"

Their telephone support suggested I build some sort of cover to shade it during the day...... seriously?

Corsair Virtuoso PRO Wired Open Back Gaming Headset - Detachable Uni-Directional Microphone - 50mm Graphene Drivers - 20Hz-40 kHz Frequency Response - Carbon,$339.9,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/corsair-virtuoso-pro-wired-open-back-gaming-headset-detachable-uni-directional-microphone-50mm-graphene-drivers-20hz-40-khz-frequency-response-carbon/17491702/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Admittedly, I am not an audiophile, but this is the best sounding headset I've owned. Pros: - Beautiful and clean design - Amazing build quality - Sound incredible - Comfortable for long work/gaming sessions Cons: - The braided cables do allow a bit of movement noise into the headset, but it's not something I notice regularly. Overall, if you're in the market for an open back gaming headset, this is an incredible option. I was a little concerned about going open back as I have two small children that can be quite noisy and I didnt want that distracting me from work. I feel like these fall somewhere between the isolation of closed back and the passthrough of open back, it's a really nice middleground."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was super excited for this headset when it came out. I loved the original Corsair Virtuoso XT, and it was cool to be able to play pc games and listen to music or you tube at the same time with bluetooth. So then here comes this headset, open back, audiophile sound quality, very comfy ear cushions, This was a must buy. I have trouble sometimes when headsets tend to not be comfortable after wearing it for a while. This is one of the very few headsets that can actually stay comfortable for hours at a time. I love this product.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I find this headset very comfortable. But be aware that it clamps a little tighter to your head than others, and the ear cups are a tad on the shallow side. Neither of these things have caused me any discomfort even after hours long sessions though. The sound quality is superb here as well! I prefer a neutral sound from my headphones though. The mic seems pretty good, and I like the convenience of a headset vs. separate microphone. The build quality is top tier as well, aside from the cord brading. The brading is sort of aggressive so you will get some noise transferred through the cable when it rubs on harder surfaces. That's really the only downside for me, and maybe a third party will make a cable with a better jacket. All in all I would say it's 4.5 stars for me. Exactly the type of headset I've been looking for personally."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm running mine with steelseries amp dac that comes withe the arctis nova pro and boy lemme tell you if the two most important things to you are imaging and openness in your 3 dimensional sound stage this is it gaming wise. The only way up from here would be magnetic planar headphones that would need some serious juice to push due to impedance and sensitivity. If you need a closed back go with Nova Pro wired for imaging and openness."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair Virtuoso Pro Open Back delivers an exceptional audio experience with its high-fidelity sound and immersive open-back design. Comfort meets style in this premium headset, making it a commendable choice for gamers and audiophiles alike. The wireless functionality and durable build further enhance its value, making it a solid investment for those seeking top-notch audio performance.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Super comfortable for long sessions, great sound staging, a surprising amount of clean sounding bass. Cables are super nice quality, mic locks into place so it doesn't rotate/swing around. Two cables, one with mic and one without, mic quality is perfectly fine for gaming. I use them for gaming, music, movies etc Footsteps are very easy to track in games,"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset still stands out with its quality even though it doesn’t have surround sound. I will say that my main plus about this product is the open back feature that makes it feel like the sides of your face can still breathe. I definitely recommend!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The mic side plug won't stay plugged. With the slightest movement the mic and mic side audio disconnects. I have to remove the headset in the middle of a game and push in that 1/4 of an inch. I would also prefer inline controls."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] You get every dollar worth with this headset the sound quality is amazing i use the sonar app with this headset and its just amazing its great for anything from music to video games to just watching videos.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent pair of open-back headphones/headset if you're looking for a good combo pair with a removable mic. The weight is good for a mix of metal and plastic. Has a solid feel and an adequate clamp force. Comfort is subjective but I found them to be fairly comfortable. What may hamper them is the ear can shape being a circle versus an oval that's more common and their shallow-ish depth. Thankfully there are third party options that offer a deeper cup to increase the comfort. Comes with cable options for audio only, headset option, and an adapter for pc connections (split audio and mic). The sound is really good with decent base, strong mids, and good highs. These make a great intro headset/headphone into open-backed audiophile territory if they are purchased on sale. If at full price i'd recommend the Sennheiser PC38X if you don't mind a non-removable mic. Also comes with very nice headphone/headset case. The only real downside I found is with the cables. Since they are rough, they do transfer noise/vibrations along the cable into the drivers when moved along another surface. May bother some, may not. Thankfully the cables can be changed with 3rd party options if it's a bother.""]"
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - 60th Diamond Edition,$449.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-60th-diamond-edition/18189366/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Is By Far The Best Bose Branded Headset I've Ever Owned. First Off, The Sound Quality It Projects Is Truly Amazing. There Is More Bass Distributed In Comparison To The QC 45 Which I Love But The Icing On The Cake, I Must Say Is Bose Implemented Immersive Audio Into These Which Left Me Breathless Upon Trying Out The Demo In The App. The Comfort And Noise Cancellation Is Second To None. Highly Recommend 10/10 !!!"", ""I received my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in color: White Smoke and am very impressed by the sleek and stylish lightweight design with only two buttons: Multi-Function/Bluetooth buttons and a volume strip, where you can easily swipe up or down to adjust volume, all located on the right side of the earcup. The headphones are padded nicely around head and ears and provide exceptional comfort level after several hours of wear. I work from home and live in town where it can get pretty noisy during the day, so really needed a pair of good noise cancelling headphones to drown out the noise of the traffic and such. My favorite starred setting when working is Quiet Mode which provides exceptional Acoustic Noise Cancelling, and I found that my production increased due to being able to concentrate more on my work by not hearing all the distracting noises that entail with working from home. When I'm not working, I love to watch movies and listen to music with my Bose surround sound system, and glad that I can easily switch between devices and pair my new headphones with my sound bar as this especially helps when it's late at night and don't want to disturb or wake others. My favorite setting for movies and music is Immersion Mode which takes it to another level of complete bliss where the music literally wraps you up and sweeps you away! I'm so impressed with the quality of sound, it's so crisp and clean! The Bose app. is a must for set-up since there's no paper manual provided. There are so many cool features, tips, and shortcuts available in the app. to where you can customize your headphones to your liking and needs, such as the Equalizer (EQ) where you can add more or less Bass & Treble. I like that I can be listening to music and able to receive phone calls, which pause my song and then resume playing after my call. Very cool and convenient Sleep/Wake features, where the headphones automatically go into sleep mode when I take them off and then wake up when you put them on, and automatically powers off after 24hrs. of inactivity all while saving battery life. There are some things to be mindful of, such as the recommended safe handling suggests placing your hands around the middle of each earcup when removing from and putting back in case as this helps keep fingers away from the hinges, so they don't get pinched. It is also not recommended to use headphones near water or moisture of any kind and to clean with a dry cloth only! I knew that Bose would have the best pair of headphones available that would meet my needs and expectations and beyond, and they have always been my number one choice and have been very happy with all their products that I've purchased over the years. Bose also has exceptional and knowledgeable customer service agents to help with all your needs and concerns. I highly recommend these headphones and all Bose products to friends, family, and to all music lovers out there! There's no comparison when it comes to Bose, they are simply the best!"", 'I love sound and technological innovations small and large because greatness isn’t in just one thing… it’s in everything even the ordinary. And I am truly honored to have this opportunity to review such a breakthrough product on so many levels. A true game changer. Phenomenal Sound Quality True immersion personified and I love being able to toggle between all three settings from immersion to quiet to awake and I love how when you take the QC ULTRAS off of your head they pause where you left off and start back playing where they were when you took them off when you place them back on your ears. Love how you can push the headset on and off so easily. This is hands down the most comfortable and sleekest headset I’ve ever owned and the performance I’ve ever owned and the performance and technological advances are out of this world combined with a simplistic yet sophisticated user friendly usability. If you want a head turning headset with stellar performance and daily use greatness than look no further than the QC ULTRAS. Cormfort is pillow soft to your ears to the point you don’t want to take them off in a good way. Ears aren’t encumbered in anyway. QC ULTRAS are a complete game changer and a must have for sound aficionados. QC ULTRAS gives you a front row seat why evolution is necessary in all facets of life if you are in the pursuit of true undeniable greatness… this headset is in my opinion epitomizes Bose’s exemplary sound quality and is their crowning achievement to date. Wore the QC ULTRAS for like two hours straight and felt like I never had anything on my ears at all even though I know for certain I did and since then I’ve worn them multiple times for even longer and feel like I could wear them 10 hours straight easy with little to no ear fatigue along with the lightness of the headset itself. Did a light workout with the QC ULTRAS and the performance was stellar and I felt zoned in on my workout in a real way but where the QC ULTRAS truly excel is in leisure and wearing walking around all day or laying down all day. The aware setting is out of this world game changing. I can hear the wind blowing, my portable electric air pump pumping my tire and I just had a full conversation in Walmart at Customer Service about electric cars and gasoline cars… the funny thing about it is the attendant was initially like you can’t even hear us can you sit and I was like these the new Bose QC ULTRAS so I can hear everything y’all saying… and to be able to say that out loud is a game changer in and of itself and was just unreal because I really could hear everything they were saying. It’s even clearer for me now after my third ownership of a Bose product why Bose is the best in the sound game in my opinion. I was able to talk to two people at once and fully engage with them in their conversation and add to it all while getting my customer service needs meet and all while still listening to music… Now that’s dope and something that a person like myself who highly values portability and versatility doesn’t take for granted.', ""Just a little background about me first. I'm a consumer who enjoys a clean and balanced sound stage (no over exaggerated lows mids or highs) when using over ear headphones or in ear buds for the purpose of enjoying different genre's of music. I listen to music often at home, while traveling, and when I'm at work. I'm not specifically an audiophile but one can enjoy a great sounding headphone with amazing features! The new Bose QC Ultra's is now my new favorite headphones. Let me explain why... Upon unboxing you're immediately drawn to the exceptional quality of the case that houses the QC Ultra's. The white smoke color in this headphone looks stunning and premium in appearance. They feel light and comfortable upon trying them on. The leather on the headband and over ear cups are thick and feel plush and can be worn for hours without feeling fatigued. I work in a laboratory setting and I've worn them for 4 to 5 hours at a time and never felt the headband pinching around my ears as well as never feeling sweaty with them on for hours. Now for the sound stage and features... So with every sense of the word phenomenal... I really think Bose hit the nail dead on with the QC Ultra's in my opinion. Once connected via wireless Bluetooth I started listening to various genre’s of music that I enjoy listening to from Rock (Foo Fighters) , Rap (Dre, Snoop, Eminem), Reggae (Bob Marley), R&B, Jazz, Metal (Metallica), and hits from the 80’s to the present day. The initial sound out of the box seems neutral and clean with a precise and pronounced separation. There is an option to adjust a basic EQ setting within the Bose app to your sound preference if you prefer a bump or distinction to your lows, mids or highs. The noise cancellation in the QC Ultra headphones are in the elite/god tier noise cancelling category as they are superior to my Sony XM's, Beats, or Apple air pod pro 2nd gen. They just seem to block out external sound the best in comparison to the other headphones I own when I want to drown out the environment around me! There was two additional features that truly surprised me... First , the immersive audio is amazing to hear and experience with every genre of music I listened. It made me hear my music in a way that resembled a concert or live experience bringing the music to life. It’s the only way I prefer to listen to music when using the QC Ultra’s. 2nd, the transparency mode or what Bose calls awareness mode is very good and is on even ground with the AirPod Pro which for several years had the best transparency feature. The awareness mode in the QC Ultra’s sound balanced and natural while listening to the external environment around me or carrying a conversation while using them. Just a couple of minor cons for me… Since I prefer to use them with immersive audio in use, this feature does drain the battery a bit faster as I’m able to use them on and off at home and work for a couple of days before needing to top of with a recharge. Bose claims approx 18 hrs which is respectable and that is roughly about the same amount of hours I was able to obtain before needing a recharge. It would have been amazing to get another 8 to 10 hrs of battery life while using immersive audio. Also, there are times I’m unable to physically answer a call or play and pause a track since it requires to physically press a button within the headphones. I work in a laboratory while wearing a lab coat, face shield and gloves and my only option is to remove one glove to use the headphones if I’m interrupted while working. It would be a game changer if Bose added a basic gesture or voice recognition feature to pause/play music or answer/end a call hands free as a future feature. Overall impression… The QC Ultra’s are very impressive in every aspect with premium sound and top tier level features! They feel comfortable and look sleek with a high end quality build. Bose has a winner with the release of the QC Ultra’s and I’ll be happily using and endorsing them to family and friends who are looking for a premium headphone! You cannot go wrong with these…. Breathtaking immersive audio sound with top tier noise cancelling and transparency/awareness features! My collection of headphones have grown and these will be the ones I’ll be reaching for the most! Great job Bose!"", 'Incredible Sound, Incredible Comfort, and Incredible Features/Technology. These headphones are everything you would expect from Bose and much more. There is so much to say about these headphones, but I don’t want to make my review so long that you don’t read it. (Smile) I will try to give you what I think are the most important reasons to make you consider buying them if you are in the market for headphones. I measure 3 most important things when it comes to deciding whether headphones meet my standards and are worth the money it cost to buy them. Those three things are: Sound quality, how comfortable they are to wear for long periods of time, and how useful the features/technology are/is in terms of making my usage experience better. Great technology that doesn’t make the headphones sound better and easier to use is almost pointless in my opinion. I work from home and work 12 to 14 hours a day, I sell Engineering Software, meaning I am on Microsoft Teams/Zoom video calls/Meetings, and traditional phone calls all day with Engineers and their Managers. When I am not talking, I like to listen to music as I work, mostly Jazz. I live for great music, and consider myself a bit of a music aficionado, and or audiophile if you will. So quality reproduction of the music as the artist intended for us to hear it is very important to me. I have had these headphones on my head each day for at least 16 to 17 hours when I combine my usage for work with my personal usage after work, and I can honestly say that the fit is the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn. The cushioning is light while around your ears, yet durable feeling at the same time. The battery life lives up to the claims and beyond, which is a very good quality, you can really get your daily long hours use out of them. The fact that the headphones can be connected simultaneously to two devices using the Bose Music App is a great feature for me because I can be listening to music from my phone or through Alexa and also be connected to my work laptop and have the ability to switch between them seamlessly, the technology built into the headphones automatically stops the music and answers a phone call or video call on my laptop, then resumes the music when I end the call. Additionally, any number of other Bluetooth Devices can be quickly connected with a toggle within the Bose Music App as well, creating quick and easy connections to all of your devices. The noise cancellation is second to none. Nothing going on around me can be heard by people on the other end of the call, moreover, also making the sound that you hear flawless without the intrusion of outside noise. The buttons have a very good tactile feel and are simple and easy to use, not overly complicated to access the many functions. A simple one, two or three click to maneuver through songs and/ or pause while listening to music, or a quick click to answer or end a call. It also has a small slightly recessed area to slide your finger either up or down to adjust the volume. Honestly, these are good improvements over the touch/feel of maneuvering through things with the other headphones and earbuds. The most important feature of the headphones is how GREAT the music sounds. I own the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones, Quiet Comfort Earbuds, and QC Earbuds II, so my bar for sound quality is pretty high. These New Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones take the sound quality of the music to the next level with the addition of Immersive Audio this feature makes you feel that the music is all around you with depth, it is the closest reproduction to Live music being played right in front of you or all around you I have ever experienced. The one and only thing that I dislike about this feature is that the Bass doesn’t seem to have the exact same punch as when this feature is off. I am truly splitting hairs here trying to find something to dislike about this feature when compared to the regular sound. I hope I have given you some important Pros as to make for compelling reasons to consider purchasing these headphones. Quite honestly, I had to search for things to dislike about these headphones and didn’t want to create some small things just to have some dislikes/Cons to make my review “seem” more balanced. I have a very high bar when it comes to justifying spending money on headphones, and these Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones pass with flying colors! I will continue to use these for hours and hours a day and be sure to add to my review in order to be as helpful as possible to those that may be considering purchasing these headphones. As of now, I would highly recommend purchasing these headphones. These are the S-Class of Bose Headphones, for sure!', 'I bought this a month ago and I love this product so much.', ""I've had these headphones for about a week but I wasn't impressed with them as another pair I own. Technologically they are amazing. I took these to the office and really noticed the amazing features. In quiet mode I thought it wasn't all that great until I took the headphones off and realized all the background noise I was able to hear. The air conditioner, people typing, paper shuffling around, etc. It was fantastic! Plus they are probably one of the most comfortable pair of over the ear headphones I have worn. I wore them all day at work and barely noticed them. Not to mention that they were at 60% battery life and they lasted through a full day of music, podcasts, and conference calls. The immersive sound is really incredible and the different settings are great. The Bose app could be a little better designed but it's pretty straight forward. I love the ability to connect it to multiple devices at once. That really came in handy at the office when I was able to connect it to my phone for music and my laptop for calls. Sounds quality is obviously exceptional. It's a Bose and they don't disappoint. My only gripe would be the price point. I have another morbid confectionery branded pair where I feel the sound is as good if not slightly better with bass. If you have the money definitely snag these for the technology alone. I am still very satisfied. After all, they're Bose."", ""I jumped from the QC25 to the new QC Ultra headphones and it doesn't get any better than this. With the QC25 you had to slide the power button from OFF to ON or to the right in order to enable Bluetooth. Now, the QC Ultra headphones have a push button (no slide), making it easier and you can avoid leaving them ON for some time. The performance is outstanding, with the 3 modes: Aware, Quiet, and Immersion. 1) Aware lets surrounding sounds in so you know what's going on while listening to the stereo audio. 2) Quiet is your brand Bose regular noise cancellation mode. 3) Immersion is the best feature for me: full noise cancellation plus Motion. You can move or be still and the audio experiences changes depending on your movement... just amazing! You can even create your custom modes with the app, making it a more personalized experience."", 'It has only been a week since I got these headphones for my husband, and he cannot stop raving about it. He made me tried them on too, and I am seriously thinking of getting another pair for myself (in the sandstone color). Here are a few things to note: Pros: - Excellent sounds quality and noise cancellation - Comfortable fit, can keep on for a few hours (e.g., trans-Atlantic flight) and your eyers do not get uncomfortably warm - Able to connect to multiple devices and easy toggle between devices (have connected this to my iPhone, surfacePro, MacAir laptop, as well as my LG OLED TV) - Immersive Audio feature with head-tracking enhances experience Cons: - High price tag - Had some initialization issues when connecting to phone (see attached pictures), but was resolved later - Immersive audio mode drains battery Overall, this is a huge upgrade from the QC 45 headphones as well as the QC II earphones', 'I love the immersive feature the most about these headphones. It really makes the music standout and seems as if you’re listening to a surround sound system. My favorite is immersive audio with quiet mode and I can listen to salsa music, alternative, and classical music. With instrumental music the sound is exceptional. The design is different but the buttons are easier to use and remember than the QC45. The headphones are comfortable and don’t ever hurt your head or feel too tight. I do have to take them off every couple of hours to scratch my ear which I think is normal. The immersive feature I would not recommend using in public so that you can be aware of your surroundings. You can use immersive in aware and it still sounds great with your surroundings. The bass is a lot stronger than prior Bose headphones when you play around with the EQ settings. Overall, the spatial audio immersive feature and the increased bass make these headphones worth it.']"

Wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4.0 stars.', ""I originally heard about them through a content creater who Is autistic. Shared with my partner the exact ones I wanted and she got them for me. As an autistic person I primarily use the noise cancelling feature when having bad sound sensitivity. They work way better then my already high expectations of them.

I like ease of use when switching between modes and checking the battery charge. Which the battery charge how long it lasts is amazing wish more products came even close to this. Will continue to use as an ade to help manage sound sensitivity and highly recommend for this alone. Even know it does other things as well. It's an amazing product.

The sound is crisp and I especially like the modes hat let you select the level of silence you desire. My issues would be that the overall quality of the material makes me worry of the durability.

Bottom line for me is once they are on your head, the sound is golden and that is primarily what I need as I.baby my devices.', ""After wanting a pair of headphones a few years I finally got the itch to go ahead and buy. I saw these and thought it was a good deal. I asked around and read the reviews saw that everyone raved about BOSE. I loved the color.

The noise cancellation works great. They make my commute to school so peaceful and they help me lock in on whatever it might be I’m working on! They also stay on perfectly while I work out. The buttons on the headphones are easy to figure out and make switching modes simple, and the app is easy to navigate. Due to their over the ear design they are extremely comfortable. The tiniest setbacks are that sometime they pull on my hair and there is some sound leakage if you have the volume really high, but things like volume can be customized in the app.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought the Bose QuietComfort (base model) a month ago, convinced they'd be amazing - and they were. The sound quality is incredible, the noice cancellation stunned me (just like the demo on Bose's website), and the 24-hour battery life is excellent. I was so impressed that I upgrade to the QuietComfort Ultra, expecting a small difference, but Bose sorprised me again. The Ultra model offers a sightly warmer and more immersive sound, engancing the listening experience. I really appreciated the additional features, especially the improved aware mode, which offers higher-quality ambient sound."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are excellent headphones!

Sony WH-CH520 On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones w/ Microphone - Blue,$69.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wh-ch520-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-w-microphone-blue/16703139/review,"['I bought this product this year precisely 13th March 2023, and it has been so good to me. Very lovely output and notice cancellation. I love it and recommending it for all', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WH-CH520 really are a great pair of Headphones with some great features too. They are 'on-ear' rather than over ear headphones and I found they're lightweight and comfortable to wear on the ears. The padding inserted underneath the headband also helps with comfort. The first thing I have to mention is the sound quality. The sound quality is excellent, particularly when used with the Sony Headphones Connect App with the various modes, audio settings and equalisers available in there. It's also possible for you to switch DSEE on and off in the app too. The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine acts as an upscaler for your music but it's not meant to be used with High-Resolution Audio files (which don’t need upscaling). I have been really impressed by the battery life. I'm still on the original charge after 4 days of use. They have a reported battery life of up to 50 hours and they also give you the option to have a quick 3 minute charge that gives you 90 minutes power. This is a handy feature, especially for commuting / travel. The Multipoint Connection enabling you to connect to 2 Bluetooth devices at the same is excellent. I was able to connect to my Laptop and phone at the same time and the call quality was clear too. General Bluetooth connections to other devices such as the TV was also easy. These really are a great pair of headphones, especially when you consider the price bracket."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones are an upgrade to my older Sony Headphones. They arrived in a nice smaller package and all paper based. The headphones are light and not intrusive whilst wearing them. There’s a lot to like but somethings I am not too sure on. The likes: The soft material used for the ears and the head are super soft and so much better than my previous ones. Charging is quick under 10 mins first time but let’s see when I drain it. It says you can charge for 3 min and get 1 and half hours play. The controls are the same as my previous ones so it was easy and quick to set up. Bluetooth connectivity to my iPhone is quick a en easy. The sound: they may not be noise cancelling but I feel the sound is super clear. You can change the EQ via the iPhone but the Sony Headphone app allow you to use a differ EQ which is more controllable I think. You can also connect to a 360 Reality Sound service giving a sound system like you are surrounded by the band and signers. Perfect for gaming and watching TV in the evening when everyone has gone to bed. Be warned! If you watching a horror or tense film it can be a rather shock when a sound jumping moment comes through. Bass and treble are controllable and some nice settings available depending on what you are listening to. Cost it’s much cheaper than I expected to be. I suffer from tinnitus and time to time I would stick on the headphones and it helps a bit. The Dislikes: At first I thought the headphones were tighter on me than my previous ones. (Note: it seems to be a bit better after wearing them for a while) Bluetooth connectivity was a bit harder on my Sony TV but easier on my IPhone. 360 reality audio : you have to pay for it. Instructions; I wish they were printed bigger but I then found them online so not so much of a dislike but a niggle. Overall: I wanted to give 5 stars but the only thing I found was holding it back was was cost of 360 Reality audio service but then I think it is unfair to do this as it’s not Sony charging for it. Quality for a value for money product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cans that can When I knew I was getting these headphones I knew exactly where they’d fit in my life, they’d replace an aging set of Sony non-noise cancelling on-ears that get more abuse and neglect than they should. I use them when buds will likely fall out and I don’t want to wear or risk either of my over ear N/C sets. But… read on… Pros Sound: clear unprocessed and balanced. Build: feels robust, creak free, positive click for adjusting headband Design: look good in black. Nice simple design, discreet classy Sony logo. Battery: yet to not be told it’s fully charged after over a week of use. Price: list price is on the money, gvfm. Cons Maybe a transport bag would be nice, but adding plastics and associated costs that may not get used is a balance. Short usb cable. USB C still arguably in roll out stages but surely we’ve all got access to longer ones. Not the best for phone calls No water resistance Unboxing Fully recyclable box packaging that opens in a series of simple layers. Effective and uncomplicated. We’ve all experienced packaging that seems designed to make getting to the contents like an encryption test. This is pleasingly straightforward. The only wrapping I don’t think is trickier to recycle is the protective wrapper around the headphones. Set up From breaking the seal to listening I would say under 5 minutes. I’ve already got the Sony headphone app, but simple QR code scan from inside the second layer box lid and that’s it. Good to go. Listen without prejudice I had music playing on some smart speakers as I was getting these ready, I put the headphones on, pressed play and… “noise cancelling”. No there is none. But maybe it’s my ear fit or head size but the music left playing on the speakers in the same room was reduced to background that didn’t interfere with the headphone output. *update* having had these for a week and listening in various situations, some noises cut straight through (think transparency on N/C phones) but I’m still impressed with their ability to isolate sound. How do they sound. I can’t claim to be an audiophile, but I have 2 N/C headphones (one an old Sony set I keep toying with replacing) and 4 N/C earbuds of various brands and price points. I also have wired buds and a Sony in-ear pair I use for work. Plus my previously mentioned “quick and dirty” Sony on-ear. These are so much better than the old set, I can honestly say I rechecked the model number. I listen to predominantly vocal based music but also dance and R&B. They sound superb, especially for the list price. Sizing and build I’ve got a relatively large head, but the clamping isn’t too severe. The padding seems to be the same as my old N/C set. It’s soft and the pu leather feels substantial. Nothing creaks and the cushioning on the headband is decent. Nice and light, with a smaller size, they are easy to chuck into a kit bag/rucksack. Summary At this price point, with few bells and whistles, the sound “feels” fuss free. I listened back to back with my N/C Sonys. Yes, the older but significantly more expensive sounded better, but I’ve found I pick these up and use them as they’re light to wear and I enjoy the open feeling of the music. Being lightweight, good value for money they’re a perfect grab and go set that sound far better than they should. No hesitation in recommending.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-CH520 is an entry-level offering from Sony, and yet they still deliver that great Sony sound you expect from the company. Some of the key features of this model are excellent battery life, quick charging and multi-device connection. The headphones come in an eco-friendly, sustainable, plastic-free box with documents and a USB-C charging cable. Unfortunately, there is no case but that is expected from this price point, however, a cloth pouch would have been a nice inclusion. The headphones are incredibly light but still feel pretty durable. Both the headband and earpads feel like they are made of memory foam, the earpads in particular are very comfortable and are easy to wear for long sessions. Initially, it looks as though there isn’t enough padding on the headband, when wearing them however, I felt there was just enough which made them fine for longer listening sessions. On the right earcup, you'll find the power/pairing button, volume/change track buttons, LED indicator, USB-C port and the built-in mic. All are well placed and I found operating the headphones fairly natural. Features Setting up the CH520s was easy, once paired, the Sony Headphones app allows you to customise the equaliser and play around with the settings. The CH520s allow you to connect to 2 devices simultaneously; this is a new, must-have feature for me as it allowed me to listen to music whilst working on my laptop and as soon as a call came on my phone, I could answer it using the headphones without disconnecting and reconnecting my devices. Call quality was decent, not something I would describe as crystal clear, however, I had no complaints from anyone I was on the phone to. The battery life is claimed to be up to an astonishing 50 hours. However, from my use, I think they were probably slightly less, but still very impressive. The only feature I would have liked from Sony is support for their own LDAC Bluetooth codec for higher bitrates, however given the price point of these headphones, I think it is understandable to exclude this feature. They do however support AAC which produces good great sound quality. Sound quality The first thing that should be done with these headphones is connect them to the Sony Headphones app and customise the equaliser to your preference. Another setting worth turning on is DSEE (Sony's upscaling technology to help get even more quality from your sound). At this price point, I wasn't sure what to expect from the sound, especially when I am used to Sony's flagship headphones, however, the CH520s left a surprisingly good impression on me. Firstly, the volume is loud enough that I didn't need to leave the headphones on the max volume the whole time; and even at max volume, there is no noticeable distortion in the sound quality. I can see that with these, the main focus is good sound quality. The Bass was excellent, thick and clear, there was no muddiness to the bass whatsoever. The mids are also excellent for the price point as they were clear, and the separation was also very good. I wouldn't say these are bass-heavy headphones, but the bass is delivered in a really enjoyable way, there is definitely some power to the bass, however, it is not over the top. The highs are where these headphones struggle very slightly (although this is just the audiophile in me nit-picking). Whilst both male and female vocals are clear, I would say that at the very high end, I just get a sense that these headphones are struggling slightly and there is a lack of clarity. But again, given where these headphones sit in Sony's range, I think the sound quality is great and you still get some of what Sony is best at. Conclusion Overall, these headphones surprised me with how capable they are in terms of sound quality, they definitely have that great Sony sound quality. I would definitely recommend these headphones for the price point; especially for children as they are light and seem fairly durable while still offering good audio quality. They also make excellent home office headphones as they are light and comfortable enough to be worn for hours, have excellent battery life and can connect to 2 devices at the same time."", ""Great headphones. The sound quality is fantastic it picks out parts that you don't really notice when using various types. The hands free operation make them an all rounder for use and when talking the quality is good. Noise cancelling is Very good.

I’m not usually a fan of on-ear headphones, but these are very comfortable and light weight, you forget you’re wearing them after a few minutes. The 50 hour battery life is a fantastic feature on such an affordable pair of headphones. The sound quality is excellent with very sharp vocals and deep bass, especially when listening to 360 Spatial Audio. In the app you can also turn on the DSEE to further enhance the sound if needed. On the right ear cup you’ll find the on/off and volume up and down buttons, there’s also a microphone for making hands free phone calls or using a voice assistant (Siri. Alexa. Etc.)

The Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE) is a great plus too have. These headphones may not have all the features but it does have the most important ones. These Sony Bluetooth headphones are very affordable and with a battery life of around 50 hours on a full charge I was happy to listen all day too a variety of music and podcasts. The headphones deliver a nice balance between bass, mids and treble with excellent detail especially after activating DSEE. At this price the audio these headphones deliver is remarkably good and is further enhanced by the use of the Sony Headphone App. to tweak the EQ. This can be downloaded from the App Store. The headphones despite the cushioning are lacking in noise-blocking and they do not have active noise cancellation so if you commute a lot bear that in mind. The shell of the headphones are textured plastic but feel really well made. You have buttons at the bottom of the right-hand shell for play/pause, volume control and track skipping and if you double-press the play button it triggers your phone’s voice assistant. The CH520 support Bluetooth multi point pairing, so you can rapidly switch between your phone, laptop for a video call etc. The connectivity is very reliable and I never experienced any problems. The battery life of 50 hours is excellent they charge via a USB-C cable. There’s no 3.5 mm jack option so bear that in mind if you want to use them on a flight. The Sony WH-CH520 has a microphone which is functional. Overall an excellent product that offers brilliant sound for a very reasonable price. Highly recommended.']"
Refurbished (Good) - Soundcore by Anker Space One Over-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$90.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/refurbished-good-soundcore-by-anker-space-one-over-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-black/17937313/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The two main things that drew me to this headset is that I find them to be very attractive and have been a fan of Soundcore in the past. The price for what you get here is insane. As you normally don’t get all the features at this price point. But with that said the features themselves do not perform at the same level as more expensive headphones. But are a solid pick for those looking for budget headphones as these may be hard to beat when you look wholistically at them. COMFORT: It is almost entirely made of plastic. It feels solid, but lightweight. Also, I didn’t notice any creaking. But not sure who these would fair with a big drop or aggressive use. It has plastic notches for the headband itself which can fit small to large heads. They feel good and it stays in place well. The earcups themselves move slightly anteriorly (forward) but fully posteriorly (backward). They also tilt just a bit. Clamping force is very light. To the point that if I shake my head they come off. Which makes them a bit frustrating when working out. As if you have a lot of movement or are lying down they will require adjustment to stay on. The foam of the earpads is solid. It’s not top of the line but not bad either. Quite soft and plushy but not amazing. In general I find them to be comfortable. I can wear them for long periods without issues. But aren’t the most comfortable things I’ve tried either. I’d probably give them a 7/10. SOUND: It is good, I’d say a 6/10 when compared to headphones that are much more expensive than them and an 8/10 for others in the same price range. It isn’t groundbreaking or something that will blow your socks off. You won’t be hearing anything new that you haven’t heard before. As these are budget headphones and I don’t want to give you unrealistic expectations. With that said for the price I think they sound great. You can easily differentiate different sounds in songs. Vocals sound clear. But it lacks sparkle that the more expensive guys will give you that will rock your soul. Which again, I wouldn’t expect at this price range. Bass is light, but present. Mids are bit recessed and muddy. Highs are slightly sharp but clear. Sounds are mostly accurate but do sound very mildly processed. I’m happy to sit and listen to music while working or working out. Also use them to watch shows/media (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). With that I do notice slight latency if I’m being hyper critical with talking videos. But if I want critical listening, I reach for something else. FEATURES: For the price I am shocked at how many features this thing packs. Some of these features require you to go into the SoundCore App to enable. Such as wear detection. Which works relatively well. It is mildly delayed where it takes about a second to play/pause the media both when taking it off and putting it back on. It comes with noise cancelling. It is meh performance wise. Where it slightly mutes or reduces lower end sounds while changing the pitch of medium or higher pitched sounds making them less noticeable. Over actually cancelling them like more expensive headphones. I’d rate the overall ANC as a 5/10. The seal of the headphone itself isn’t significant but does most of the work (passive noise cancelling). The transparency mode is solid. I found it lets in a good amount of noise allowing me to hear what is going on around me and allows me to have a conversation without too much trouble. But isn’t to the level of Apples transparency. When you first power on the headset it will say connected along with the battery level which I like. It will also announce when it is in pairing mode and when the battery is low. I found the alerts themselves were the right volume of not being deafening nor too quiet where you can’t hear what it is saying. The App itself is great. It adds a lot of features and is worth checking out. One interesting point is the “heardID” which should give you better sound based on your personal hearing. This didn’t work well for me. You also have access to a custom EQ (8 band 100, 200, 400, 800, 1.6k, 3.2k, 6.4k, and 12.8k). You can have multiple custom EQ’s saved. There are multiple preset sounds you can select. I chose “Soundcore Signature” as I figure that is what most people will leave it on as that is the default mode. Quick spewing of a bunch of other features in a single paragraph. “Easy chat” (turn on in app first) that enables transparency mode if you hold left side of earcup. Works well. Also, has a speak to enable. Which does the same thing and will enable when it thinks it hears a voice. Which turns off after stop speaking for 5 seconds or pressing NC button. I like that you can cancel this manually. “Safe volume” will limit how loud the headphones can get. But found that it isn’t necessary on these as they don’t get very loud (on my iPhone 14 Pro Max) as the max I got was about 78 dB at full volume. I did find if I had this enabled that it would make everything quieter way before it got close to the limit I had placed so left it off. Dual connections. Auto power off (30, 60, 90, 120, never). Voice prompt for battery and ambient sound. For the price the features are actually insane. There is also a 3.5 mm jack (which is included) for wired listening and it does not need to be powered on for that. USB-C for charging. Great battery life. CONTROLS: On the left earcup on the bottom you have your power on/off. If you long press that when powering on it will go into pairing mode. Just above that is the noise cancelling, transparency, or normal mode. I like that it actually says the mode over giving you a vague tone. If you double tap the top button it goes between normal mode and bass boost. Unfortunately, this double tap doesn’t work all the time and is finicky with timing. On the right earcup you have your play/pause. Which is finicky and doesn’t always work on first try and there is a bit of a delay. Skip forward/backward is not supported. Or at least that I could figure out as multiple presses to the button does nothing. Just above that you have your volume up and down button. All buttons feel the same without variance, with a satisfying bump when clicked and a quiet click. You do get mild microphonics in the earcup when messing with them. CONCLUSION: At first glance and when operating normally these things perform excellently for their price. And I think if you gave them to others and had them try them out, they would think they are more expensive than they are. But once you start nitpicking and comparing them to more expensive headphones you understand why there is a price difference. But for most people who aren’t wanting the best and just want a solid pair of headphones these will be a great pick that will do nearly everything you want well without breaking the bank.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I gave these five stars because of the price, features, and sound quality. I have lots of over the ear headphones ranging from $30 to $400. Even those these are on the cheaper they have a lot of features and sound very good. These will not replace my $400 headphones, but these will be used for travel and other places I don’t want to take expensive headphones. When I first got these and hooked them up to my tablet I was a little disappointed with sound and bass. Then I realized I needed to download their application to fine tune/setup the headphones. Once I downloaded the app, the headphones received an update that drastically changed the sound of the headphones for the better. The app is very easy to use and allows you to customize some of the buttons on the headphones, change the equalizer, and learn more about the device. I like that the equalizer allows you to customize your own, pick from multiple preset ones, or use the app to create a perfect equalizer for your ears. The headphones themselves are not flashy (which I love) and the controls are easy to use. On the headphones you have power, volume up/down also controls skip forward or back, play pause also can be used for answer and hangup phone call, and noise canceling (cycles through the three modes). If you place your hand over the left speaker it mutes the music and turns off noise canceling to allow you to hear the environment around you. Once you take your hand off the music plays and the noise canceling turns back on. These headphones also have a feature that if you take off the headphones it will pause whatever is playing. I had a little trouble with this feature as it worked sometimes but not always. The sound on these headphones is full and rich. I listen to all different types of music and these headphones play everything with ease. The noise canceling does a great job as I couldn’t hear anything penetrating in from noisy environment I tested them in. Even if you do not have anything playing the noise canceling works pretty well if you just need a quiet moment. I also like the fact that these headphones use Bluetooth or can use an AUX cable as well. It’s nice to have that choice if your device has a headphone output. Battery life has been stellar as well, I used them for about 8 hours watching tv at a moderate level and only used 10% of the battery. So these will last a long time on a single charge. They are also very comfortable to wear and did not cause my ears to get hot like other ones have. Overall these are a solid buy considering the functions and sound quality at the price point. The headphones also came with a carrying bag, charging cable, and an aux cable. The carrying bag is nothing fancy but nice to be able to keep cables and headphones all in one place.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just so people are aware, Soundcore is Anker\'s line of audio products. Anker came into the scene seemingly out of nowhere as a prominent figure in the electronics and accessories market over the past few years. I\'d put them on par with more established companies like Belkin and Mophie at this point. I\'ve been purchasing their gallium nitride (GaN) technology power bricks and cables for ages now and have been fairly happy with my purchases. This is actually my first Soundcore product and I\'m honestly surprised at how well it does compared to my other active noise cancelling (ANC) over-ears. I quite literally own all the mainstream ANC headsets by Sony, Bose, and Apple and TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRICE, this is a great option. Sound quality could be better - particularly with the richness of the sound itself and the overall soundstage/fullness of the sound itself. However, you can make it sound better when you tweak the settings through the Soundcore app. The app also lets you play around with the noise cancelling, which was surprisingly good and honestly on par with much more expensive options. I would say this would be a GREAT gift for high school/college-level students and even for those who just want something affordable with ANC. I tried them on a 3-hour domestic flight and it did a phenomenal job of drowning out the standard cabin noises, including a crying toddler! I never got to test out the full capacity of the battery but this thing is rated for 40 hours with the ANC on and 55 hours with the ANC turned off, which is entirely very impressive. I wouldn\'t recommend these for those who want to use these primarily for phone and conference calls as the microphone isn\'t particularly great. I don\'t know if it\'s the noise reducing microphones or what but the people I spoke with mentioned that I didn\'t sound all that clear, if anything a little ""distant"" from the mic itself. Overall, though, a great budget option for people seeking a reasonably-priced, ANC-compatible b/t headset.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are not the first Soundcore or Anker product I have owned. I have a set of Soundcore earbuds and a few of their charging cables. Like Anker’s other products, these headphones are a reasonable price and an excellent value for the performance they offer. Pros 1. Solid build quality and comfortable to wear. The hinges that allow them to fold for storage are tight and there is no squeaky plastic sound when adjusting them or wearing them. Plastics are nicely textured with a subtle design. I am bald and the headband is nicely cushioned for wearing for longer periods. My wife and daughter have braids and they said they fit well with no pulling from hair getting caught in hinges and plenty of adjustment. 2. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is effective and has a lot of adjustments to fit your use – allowing you to pick different levels, use an adaptive setting that adjust with background noise, and a few options to allow audio pass through for conversations or awareness (like walking on a street). With full noise cancelling on at moderate volume – all background noise and most conversations are blocked out (I have actually missed people talking to me completely with the volume up). 3. Physical buttons for volume, noise cancelling mode changes, play/pause, and power/pairing which are far more reliable than touch controls that some headphones have. 4. Good sound quality with high quality audio over Bluetooth (LDAC) support and a lot of audio adjustments via the Soundcore app. The app offers an audio test to help you set your equalizer settings – which is cool, but I still had to make some tweaks to the equalizer to get the bass where I wanted – overall volume and clarity are good. 5. Excellent battery life. I have not had to recharge them yet, but in the 5 days I have owned them, I am averaging around 2% per hour of listening with LDAC and noise cancelling enabled (this is in line or a little better than the 40 hours provided by Anker in the specs with these features enabled – it is 55 hours LDAC and ANC off). 6. Wired operation (with an included 4ft headphone cable) is available for devices that don’t support Bluetooth and you can even use it as a headset for calls via the wire. 7. Works well as a headset and even has a wind noise reduction option via the Soundcore app. I didn’t test this in a windy place, but phone calls I took while wearing them around the house were clear on my end and people on the other end said I sounded as good or better than when using my cellphone. 8. Wearing detection works great to pause playback if you take the headphones off (once you configure it in the app). Things to Consider 1. The Soundcore app is excellent, but also required to get the most out of these headphones. Default audio settings are just adequate, and these really work better with the equalizer available in the app. You also have to use the app to enable hi-res audio and wearing detection. Just make sure to disable any default equalizers in your phone audio settings to avoid conflicts with the app's equalizer (I was getting some weird reverb from having my Motorola’s default Dolby audio enhancements on with the Soundcore equalizer)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression was that these matte black headphones are slick and have a sophisticated flair to them. Although they are mostly plastic, they seem well-built, and I hope they last. I was very pleased that there wasn't any creaking. The headphones have ample flexibility, and the cups are decently adjustable. Now, they are very well padded and super soft –both on the cups and the headband. Although there is light clamping force, they still stay on during walks and normal head movement. They are quite light, so I experienced almost no fatigue during long sessions. They do get a bit hot though. I also tried them with a hat and glasses with no issues. The Space Ones feature Bluetooth 5.3 so pairing them was easy. I did not notice any real issues at normal distances and encountered little to no lag or sync issues. There is an option for multiple point connection, but that would disable the LDAC capability. The ANC/ambient sound modes worked great. Although I could still hear higher pitch sounds, it made listening in crowded and traffic settings a good experience. The ambient mode made things sound a bit unnatural, but it is welcomed when awareness is needed. I love that these headphones can be muted with ambient mode by cupping the left cup. Also, while I found it a bit inconsistent, there is a speak-to-mute option as well. To top it off, the cups have auto-pause/play when taking the headset off or putting it on. The call quality is good. It is still very obvious that I was on Bluetooth, but I was heard clearly. I did pick up a bit of wind noise, but it was no big deal due to the wind-reduction mode. The battery life is superb. With ANC/Ambient on, Soundcore claims 40 hours and I am inclined to believe it, since I haven't had the need to charge them after almost 4 days. It can go 55 hours plus without ANC/Ambient on. I am also glad that there is fast-charging where 5 minutes on the charger gives 4 hours of playtime. One thing to note is that LDAC will drain the battery faster. Should the battery be completely drained, you can always use the 3.5mm cable (if your device supports that). You can control all functions from the tactile buttons on the cups, and that is a plus for me. The controls are responsive, and I prefer them to touch controls –especially in cold weather. The default audio is what impressed me the most. While I love listening to high quality sound from a critical standpoint, the Space Ones delivered a very pleasant sound signature. I found that the bass is a bit restrained but precise. The middle is well represented, making vocals, choruses, rhythm, instruments, and dialogue stand out well. The treble adds clarity without being harsh. There is ample soundstage and imaging with great channel separation. This is even more impressive once LDAC is activated on a supported device. Although subtle, I found that I appreciated the sound signature best with ANC on. Just in case, you can always customize the sound with the presets and full-range EQ on the app. Speaking of the app, I would highly recommend downloading it as it provides more options such as firmware updates, ANC/Ambient levels, control settings, LDAC support, multipoint, and many more. If there is anything to nitpick, I’d say that the carrying bag is disappointing, and I wish there were more options for the function button. In the end, you can easily say that I am overly impressed with the Space Ones, and certainly recommend checking them out. While definitely not audiophile quality level, or bass-head oriented, they are very pleasant to listen to. They are jammed packed with features that many more expensive headsets lack or are almost at the same level, and for the asking price, these are hard to pass."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these as a gift to myself and I couldn’t be happier!! The sound quality makes me feel immersed in whatever I am listening to. Love the options the app provides too! I learned a lot about what my sound preferences are by adjusting the different options available. Listening to music while I work with these on has helped my focus 10x more than just listening from my iPad or tv. The are sleek looking and the headband & ear cushions are so smooth too! The fold into a compact easy to travel with size & charge INCREDIBLY quick! Only have 5 mins to charge before you leave the house? You get more than a few hours worth of power. Can’t stress enough how ecstatic I am with these Soundcore headphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: LIGHT - These Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones are the lightest headphones I\'ve ever worn (and I\'ve worn many). COMFORT - It is clear that Anker wanted to ensure that comfort was one of its priorities because these are VERY comfortable to wear. The ear cups are large for all ear sizes and the weight distribution is very balanced. OPTIONS - To get the most out of these, you will need the Soundcore app which allows you to equalize and set up your own sound profile. It also has 22 preset EQ settings depending on the music you like. Audio jack and cable included! Transparent mode allows you to listen to your environment. TECHNOLOGY - Noise cancelling features are excellent especially while music is playing simultaneously. They have ""Adaptive Noise Cancelling"" which is supposed to adjust with your environment, although it\'s sort of hard to tell what changes. CHARGE - 5 min charge gets you 4hrs and a full charge gets you 40-55 hrs. USB-C cable included, but no wall plug SOUND QUALITY - So crisp and adaptible. CONS: PORTABILITY - These don\'t fold so if you\'re carrying them, they\'ll be full size. This is understandable though because less hinges means the headphones remain lighter. BUTTONS - Lots of newer headphones have touch and slide features on the sides of headphones, these have buttons. On the other hand, it\'s good to have that tactile feel, but this one is up to user preference. DURABILITY? - I put a question mark on this because only time will tell. However, I\'m skeptical of the soft material on the ear cups and the upper headband. At least the headphones come with a duffel carrying pouch to protect them. Bass? Check. Mids? Check. Treble? Check. Highs? Check. I highly recommend these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My honest review for the sound core headphones, let me start off by saying this headphones are probably one of the best mid priced in the market. My review will be based on 4 features on a scale from 1 to 10 / Style/ Comfortability/ Sound and Specs. Style: based on my experience the style is great but not the best looking, it lacks a bit of a modern feel. The material tends to have a fingerprint magnet, I am constantly needing to clean my headphones. Other than that I like color way. Comfortability: I have big ears and with that my ears get tired when using over the head headphones, with these Soundcore I have been really impressed. I use my headphones mostly the entire day and have not had any complaints or felt my ears sore from use all day. The material on the ear cups have a soft foam with leather and big enough to cover around the ear. The band is also made of the same material and comfortable. Sound: by far best sound I’ve had for a mid priced headphones, the audio quality is very premium. The audio drivers are very well designed making it a perfect balance. I’ve tried the audio with a different big brand and listened to 8D music and by far the sound is very crisp on these Soundcore headsets. Specs: one the best features it has is the ability to have two different devices connected at the same time. I work in the office and use my headphones for music and have a laptop connected so I can hear if anyone messages me. This is an awesome feature. Another great feature is the ANC support, I tell you it blocks everyone out when having it turned on. The best feature from this headphone is the battery! One of the best batteries I’ve had to experiment. I can charge my headphones one time and use it the whole week with ANC turned on and will have battery life at Medium charge. I will stand by this and proved to have the best battery life. Final: If you’re looking for a great headset that has amazing battery life, great audio performance and great comfortable design. Then this headphones are for you. It may not have the best styles but with other great features that makes up that part. I give this headphones 9.0 out of 10 or 4.5 Stars. A great pair to have.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m so happy I decided to try this brand! The look of the headphones is so sleek and beautiful. You don’t need to buy beats. Look into other alternatives like I did bcuz these beat out the best. The ear pieces sit comfortably on your head and ears, but of course, pressure overtime will start to feel slightly uncomfortable, but these don’t!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset may not look the best or trendy, but everything else is top notch. There are minor issues that other high end headset don’t have, but it makes up with sound quality, features and comfort. Regarding comfort, the soft padding is very comfortable and creates a perfect seal so when blocking ambient sound, it works well. It come with the most useful feature not found on any of my other headsets… hearing test which helps to automatically adjust the volume. It only has one touch command which is used to activate or deactivate ambient sound during conversations. This can be done automatically too. It has physical volume and off and on buttons. Another minor deficiency is the fact that neither the up nor the announcer tells how much percentage of battery charge remains… is either full or not. The app has many features that can be adjusted such manual equalizer, multiple sound settings from music categories such as pop, classical, Rock etc. The build quality is good and the battery an entire day with heavy use. Unfortunately no exact percentage charge remaining is available either by app or announced, though there is an icon indicator in the app. This is a set worthy consideration as a gift or for pc or phone companion.']"
Refurbished (Good) - Soundcore by Anker Space One Over-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - White,$79.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/refurbished-good-soundcore-by-anker-space-one-over-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-white/17937312/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The two main things that drew me to this headset is that I find them to be very attractive and have been a fan of Soundcore in the past. The price for what you get here is insane. As you normally don’t get all the features at this price point. But with that said the features themselves do not perform at the same level as more expensive headphones. But are a solid pick for those looking for budget headphones as these may be hard to beat when you look wholistically at them. COMFORT: It is almost entirely made of plastic. It feels solid, but lightweight. Also, I didn’t notice any creaking. But not sure who these would fair with a big drop or aggressive use. It has plastic notches for the headband itself which can fit small to large heads. They feel good and it stays in place well. The earcups themselves move slightly anteriorly (forward) but fully posteriorly (backward). They also tilt just a bit. Clamping force is very light. To the point that if I shake my head they come off. Which makes them a bit frustrating when working out. As if you have a lot of movement or are lying down they will require adjustment to stay on. The foam of the earpads is solid. It’s not top of the line but not bad either. Quite soft and plushy but not amazing. In general I find them to be comfortable. I can wear them for long periods without issues. But aren’t the most comfortable things I’ve tried either. I’d probably give them a 7/10. SOUND: It is good, I’d say a 6/10 when compared to headphones that are much more expensive than them and an 8/10 for others in the same price range. It isn’t groundbreaking or something that will blow your socks off. You won’t be hearing anything new that you haven’t heard before. As these are budget headphones and I don’t want to give you unrealistic expectations. With that said for the price I think they sound great. You can easily differentiate different sounds in songs. Vocals sound clear. But it lacks sparkle that the more expensive guys will give you that will rock your soul. Which again, I wouldn’t expect at this price range. Bass is light, but present. Mids are bit recessed and muddy. Highs are slightly sharp but clear. Sounds are mostly accurate but do sound very mildly processed. I’m happy to sit and listen to music while working or working out. Also use them to watch shows/media (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). With that I do notice slight latency if I’m being hyper critical with talking videos. But if I want critical listening, I reach for something else. FEATURES: For the price I am shocked at how many features this thing packs. Some of these features require you to go into the SoundCore App to enable. Such as wear detection. Which works relatively well. It is mildly delayed where it takes about a second to play/pause the media both when taking it off and putting it back on. It comes with noise cancelling. It is meh performance wise. Where it slightly mutes or reduces lower end sounds while changing the pitch of medium or higher pitched sounds making them less noticeable. Over actually cancelling them like more expensive headphones. I’d rate the overall ANC as a 5/10. The seal of the headphone itself isn’t significant but does most of the work (passive noise cancelling). The transparency mode is solid. I found it lets in a good amount of noise allowing me to hear what is going on around me and allows me to have a conversation without too much trouble. But isn’t to the level of Apples transparency. When you first power on the headset it will say connected along with the battery level which I like. It will also announce when it is in pairing mode and when the battery is low. I found the alerts themselves were the right volume of not being deafening nor too quiet where you can’t hear what it is saying. The App itself is great. It adds a lot of features and is worth checking out. One interesting point is the “heardID” which should give you better sound based on your personal hearing. This didn’t work well for me. You also have access to a custom EQ (8 band 100, 200, 400, 800, 1.6k, 3.2k, 6.4k, and 12.8k). You can have multiple custom EQ’s saved. There are multiple preset sounds you can select. I chose “Soundcore Signature” as I figure that is what most people will leave it on as that is the default mode. Quick spewing of a bunch of other features in a single paragraph. “Easy chat” (turn on in app first) that enables transparency mode if you hold left side of earcup. Works well. Also, has a speak to enable. Which does the same thing and will enable when it thinks it hears a voice. Which turns off after stop speaking for 5 seconds or pressing NC button. I like that you can cancel this manually. “Safe volume” will limit how loud the headphones can get. But found that it isn’t necessary on these as they don’t get very loud (on my iPhone 14 Pro Max) as the max I got was about 78 dB at full volume. I did find if I had this enabled that it would make everything quieter way before it got close to the limit I had placed so left it off. Dual connections. Auto power off (30, 60, 90, 120, never). Voice prompt for battery and ambient sound. For the price the features are actually insane. There is also a 3.5 mm jack (which is included) for wired listening and it does not need to be powered on for that. USB-C for charging. Great battery life. CONTROLS: On the left earcup on the bottom you have your power on/off. If you long press that when powering on it will go into pairing mode. Just above that is the noise cancelling, transparency, or normal mode. I like that it actually says the mode over giving you a vague tone. If you double tap the top button it goes between normal mode and bass boost. Unfortunately, this double tap doesn’t work all the time and is finicky with timing. On the right earcup you have your play/pause. Which is finicky and doesn’t always work on first try and there is a bit of a delay. Skip forward/backward is not supported. Or at least that I could figure out as multiple presses to the button does nothing. Just above that you have your volume up and down button. All buttons feel the same without variance, with a satisfying bump when clicked and a quiet click. You do get mild microphonics in the earcup when messing with them. CONCLUSION: At first glance and when operating normally these things perform excellently for their price. And I think if you gave them to others and had them try them out, they would think they are more expensive than they are. But once you start nitpicking and comparing them to more expensive headphones you understand why there is a price difference. But for most people who aren’t wanting the best and just want a solid pair of headphones these will be a great pick that will do nearly everything you want well without breaking the bank.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I gave these five stars because of the price, features, and sound quality. I have lots of over the ear headphones ranging from $30 to $400. Even those these are on the cheaper they have a lot of features and sound very good. These will not replace my $400 headphones, but these will be used for travel and other places I don’t want to take expensive headphones. When I first got these and hooked them up to my tablet I was a little disappointed with sound and bass. Then I realized I needed to download their application to fine tune/setup the headphones. Once I downloaded the app, the headphones received an update that drastically changed the sound of the headphones for the better. The app is very easy to use and allows you to customize some of the buttons on the headphones, change the equalizer, and learn more about the device. I like that the equalizer allows you to customize your own, pick from multiple preset ones, or use the app to create a perfect equalizer for your ears. The headphones themselves are not flashy (which I love) and the controls are easy to use. On the headphones you have power, volume up/down also controls skip forward or back, play pause also can be used for answer and hangup phone call, and noise canceling (cycles through the three modes). If you place your hand over the left speaker it mutes the music and turns off noise canceling to allow you to hear the environment around you. Once you take your hand off the music plays and the noise canceling turns back on. These headphones also have a feature that if you take off the headphones it will pause whatever is playing. I had a little trouble with this feature as it worked sometimes but not always. The sound on these headphones is full and rich. I listen to all different types of music and these headphones play everything with ease. The noise canceling does a great job as I couldn’t hear anything penetrating in from noisy environment I tested them in. Even if you do not have anything playing the noise canceling works pretty well if you just need a quiet moment. I also like the fact that these headphones use Bluetooth or can use an AUX cable as well. It’s nice to have that choice if your device has a headphone output. Battery life has been stellar as well, I used them for about 8 hours watching tv at a moderate level and only used 10% of the battery. So these will last a long time on a single charge. They are also very comfortable to wear and did not cause my ears to get hot like other ones have. Overall these are a solid buy considering the functions and sound quality at the price point. The headphones also came with a carrying bag, charging cable, and an aux cable. The carrying bag is nothing fancy but nice to be able to keep cables and headphones all in one place.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just so people are aware, Soundcore is Anker\'s line of audio products. Anker came into the scene seemingly out of nowhere as a prominent figure in the electronics and accessories market over the past few years. I\'d put them on par with more established companies like Belkin and Mophie at this point. I\'ve been purchasing their gallium nitride (GaN) technology power bricks and cables for ages now and have been fairly happy with my purchases. This is actually my first Soundcore product and I\'m honestly surprised at how well it does compared to my other active noise cancelling (ANC) over-ears. I quite literally own all the mainstream ANC headsets by Sony, Bose, and Apple and TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRICE, this is a great option. Sound quality could be better - particularly with the richness of the sound itself and the overall soundstage/fullness of the sound itself. However, you can make it sound better when you tweak the settings through the Soundcore app. The app also lets you play around with the noise cancelling, which was surprisingly good and honestly on par with much more expensive options. I would say this would be a GREAT gift for high school/college-level students and even for those who just want something affordable with ANC. I tried them on a 3-hour domestic flight and it did a phenomenal job of drowning out the standard cabin noises, including a crying toddler! I never got to test out the full capacity of the battery but this thing is rated for 40 hours with the ANC on and 55 hours with the ANC turned off, which is entirely very impressive. I wouldn\'t recommend these for those who want to use these primarily for phone and conference calls as the microphone isn\'t particularly great. I don\'t know if it\'s the noise reducing microphones or what but the people I spoke with mentioned that I didn\'t sound all that clear, if anything a little ""distant"" from the mic itself. Overall, though, a great budget option for people seeking a reasonably-priced, ANC-compatible b/t headset.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are not the first Soundcore or Anker product I have owned. I have a set of Soundcore earbuds and a few of their charging cables. Like Anker’s other products, these headphones are a reasonable price and an excellent value for the performance they offer. Pros 1. Solid build quality and comfortable to wear. The hinges that allow them to fold for storage are tight and there is no squeaky plastic sound when adjusting them or wearing them. Plastics are nicely textured with a subtle design. I am bald and the headband is nicely cushioned for wearing for longer periods. My wife and daughter have braids and they said they fit well with no pulling from hair getting caught in hinges and plenty of adjustment. 2. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is effective and has a lot of adjustments to fit your use – allowing you to pick different levels, use an adaptive setting that adjust with background noise, and a few options to allow audio pass through for conversations or awareness (like walking on a street). With full noise cancelling on at moderate volume – all background noise and most conversations are blocked out (I have actually missed people talking to me completely with the volume up). 3. Physical buttons for volume, noise cancelling mode changes, play/pause, and power/pairing which are far more reliable than touch controls that some headphones have. 4. Good sound quality with high quality audio over Bluetooth (LDAC) support and a lot of audio adjustments via the Soundcore app. The app offers an audio test to help you set your equalizer settings – which is cool, but I still had to make some tweaks to the equalizer to get the bass where I wanted – overall volume and clarity are good. 5. Excellent battery life. I have not had to recharge them yet, but in the 5 days I have owned them, I am averaging around 2% per hour of listening with LDAC and noise cancelling enabled (this is in line or a little better than the 40 hours provided by Anker in the specs with these features enabled – it is 55 hours LDAC and ANC off). 6. Wired operation (with an included 4ft headphone cable) is available for devices that don’t support Bluetooth and you can even use it as a headset for calls via the wire. 7. Works well as a headset and even has a wind noise reduction option via the Soundcore app. I didn’t test this in a windy place, but phone calls I took while wearing them around the house were clear on my end and people on the other end said I sounded as good or better than when using my cellphone. 8. Wearing detection works great to pause playback if you take the headphones off (once you configure it in the app). Things to Consider 1. The Soundcore app is excellent, but also required to get the most out of these headphones. Default audio settings are just adequate, and these really work better with the equalizer available in the app. You also have to use the app to enable hi-res audio and wearing detection. Just make sure to disable any default equalizers in your phone audio settings to avoid conflicts with the app's equalizer (I was getting some weird reverb from having my Motorola’s default Dolby audio enhancements on with the Soundcore equalizer)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression was that these matte black headphones are slick and have a sophisticated flair to them. Although they are mostly plastic, they seem well-built, and I hope they last. I was very pleased that there wasn't any creaking. The headphones have ample flexibility, and the cups are decently adjustable. Now, they are very well padded and super soft –both on the cups and the headband. Although there is light clamping force, they still stay on during walks and normal head movement. They are quite light, so I experienced almost no fatigue during long sessions. They do get a bit hot though. I also tried them with a hat and glasses with no issues. The Space Ones feature Bluetooth 5.3 so pairing them was easy. I did not notice any real issues at normal distances and encountered little to no lag or sync issues. There is an option for multiple point connection, but that would disable the LDAC capability. The ANC/ambient sound modes worked great. Although I could still hear higher pitch sounds, it made listening in crowded and traffic settings a good experience. The ambient mode made things sound a bit unnatural, but it is welcomed when awareness is needed. I love that these headphones can be muted with ambient mode by cupping the left cup. Also, while I found it a bit inconsistent, there is a speak-to-mute option as well. To top it off, the cups have auto-pause/play when taking the headset off or putting it on. The call quality is good. It is still very obvious that I was on Bluetooth, but I was heard clearly. I did pick up a bit of wind noise, but it was no big deal due to the wind-reduction mode. The battery life is superb. With ANC/Ambient on, Soundcore claims 40 hours and I am inclined to believe it, since I haven't had the need to charge them after almost 4 days. It can go 55 hours plus without ANC/Ambient on. I am also glad that there is fast-charging where 5 minutes on the charger gives 4 hours of playtime. One thing to note is that LDAC will drain the battery faster. Should the battery be completely drained, you can always use the 3.5mm cable (if your device supports that). You can control all functions from the tactile buttons on the cups, and that is a plus for me. The controls are responsive, and I prefer them to touch controls –especially in cold weather. The default audio is what impressed me the most. While I love listening to high quality sound from a critical standpoint, the Space Ones delivered a very pleasant sound signature. I found that the bass is a bit restrained but precise. The middle is well represented, making vocals, choruses, rhythm, instruments, and dialogue stand out well. The treble adds clarity without being harsh. There is ample soundstage and imaging with great channel separation. This is even more impressive once LDAC is activated on a supported device. Although subtle, I found that I appreciated the sound signature best with ANC on. Just in case, you can always customize the sound with the presets and full-range EQ on the app. Speaking of the app, I would highly recommend downloading it as it provides more options such as firmware updates, ANC/Ambient levels, control settings, LDAC support, multipoint, and many more. If there is anything to nitpick, I’d say that the carrying bag is disappointing, and I wish there were more options for the function button. In the end, you can easily say that I am overly impressed with the Space Ones, and certainly recommend checking them out. While definitely not audiophile quality level, or bass-head oriented, they are very pleasant to listen to. They are jammed packed with features that many more expensive headsets lack or are almost at the same level, and for the asking price, these are hard to pass."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these as a gift to myself and I couldn’t be happier!! The sound quality makes me feel immersed in whatever I am listening to. Love the options the app provides too! I learned a lot about what my sound preferences are by adjusting the different options available. Listening to music while I work with these on has helped my focus 10x more than just listening from my iPad or tv. The are sleek looking and the headband & ear cushions are so smooth too! The fold into a compact easy to travel with size & charge INCREDIBLY quick! Only have 5 mins to charge before you leave the house? You get more than a few hours worth of power. Can’t stress enough how ecstatic I am with these Soundcore headphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: LIGHT - These Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones are the lightest headphones I\'ve ever worn (and I\'ve worn many). COMFORT - It is clear that Anker wanted to ensure that comfort was one of its priorities because these are VERY comfortable to wear. The ear cups are large for all ear sizes and the weight distribution is very balanced. OPTIONS - To get the most out of these, you will need the Soundcore app which allows you to equalize and set up your own sound profile. It also has 22 preset EQ settings depending on the music you like. Audio jack and cable included! Transparent mode allows you to listen to your environment. TECHNOLOGY - Noise cancelling features are excellent especially while music is playing simultaneously. They have ""Adaptive Noise Cancelling"" which is supposed to adjust with your environment, although it\'s sort of hard to tell what changes. CHARGE - 5 min charge gets you 4hrs and a full charge gets you 40-55 hrs. USB-C cable included, but no wall plug SOUND QUALITY - So crisp and adaptible. CONS: PORTABILITY - These don\'t fold so if you\'re carrying them, they\'ll be full size. This is understandable though because less hinges means the headphones remain lighter. BUTTONS - Lots of newer headphones have touch and slide features on the sides of headphones, these have buttons. On the other hand, it\'s good to have that tactile feel, but this one is up to user preference. DURABILITY? - I put a question mark on this because only time will tell. However, I\'m skeptical of the soft material on the ear cups and the upper headband. At least the headphones come with a duffel carrying pouch to protect them. Bass? Check. Mids? Check. Treble? Check. Highs? Check. I highly recommend these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My honest review for the sound core headphones, let me start off by saying this headphones are probably one of the best mid priced in the market.

All buttons feel the same without variance, with a satisfying bump when clicked and a quiet click. You do get mild microphonics in the earcup when messing with them. CONCLUSION: At first glance and when operating normally these things perform excellently for their price. And I think if you gave them to others and had them try them out, they would think they are more expensive than they are. But once you start nitpicking and comparing them to more expensive headphones you understand why there is a price difference. But for most people who aren’t wanting the best and just want a solid pair of headphones these will be a great pick that will do nearly everything you want well without breaking the bank.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I gave these five stars because of the price, features, and sound quality. I have lots of over the ear headphones ranging from $30 to $400. Even those these are on the cheaper they have a lot of features and sound very good. These will not replace my $400 headphones, but these will be used for travel and other places I don’t want to take expensive headphones. When I first got these and hooked them up to my tablet I was a little disappointed with sound and bass. Then I realized I needed to download their application to fine tune/setup the headphones. Once I downloaded the app, the headphones received an update that drastically changed the sound of the headphones for the better. The app is very easy to use and allows you to customize some of the buttons on the headphones, change the equalizer, and learn more about the device. I like that the equalizer allows you to customize your own, pick from multiple preset ones, or use the app to create a perfect equalizer for your ears. The headphones themselves are not flashy (which I love) and the controls are easy to use. On the headphones you have power, volume up/down also controls skip forward or back, play pause also can be used for answer and hangup phone call, and noise canceling (cycles through the three modes). If you place your hand over the left speaker it mutes the music and turns off noise canceling to allow you to hear the environment around you. Once you take your hand off the music plays and the noise canceling turns back on. These headphones also have a feature that if you take off the headphones it will pause whatever is playing. I had a little trouble with this feature as it worked sometimes but not always. The sound on these headphones is full and rich. I listen to all different types of music and these headphones play everything with ease. The noise canceling does a great job as I couldn’t hear anything penetrating in from noisy environment I tested them in. Even if you do not have anything playing the noise canceling works pretty well if you just need a quiet moment. I also like the fact that these headphones use Bluetooth or can use an AUX cable as well. It’s nice to have that choice if your device has a headphone output. Battery life has been stellar as well, I used them for about 8 hours watching tv at a moderate level and only used 10% of the battery. So these will last a long time on a single charge. They are also very comfortable to wear and did not cause my ears to get hot like other ones have. Overall these are a solid buy considering the functions and sound quality at the price point. The headphones also came with a carrying bag, charging cable, and an aux cable. The carrying bag is nothing fancy but nice to be able to keep cables and headphones all in one place.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just so people are aware, Soundcore is Anker\'s line of audio products. Anker came into the scene seemingly out of nowhere as a prominent figure in the electronics and accessories market over the past few years. I\'d put them on par with more established companies like Belkin and Mophie at this point. I\'ve been purchasing their gallium nitride (GaN) technology power bricks and cables for ages now and have been fairly happy with my purchases. This is actually my first Soundcore product and I\'m honestly surprised at how well it does compared to my other active noise cancelling (ANC) over-ears. I quite literally own all the mainstream ANC headsets by Sony, Bose, and Apple and TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRICE, this is a great option. Sound quality could be better - particularly with the richness of the sound itself and the overall soundstage/fullness of the sound itself. However, you can make it sound better when you tweak the settings through the Soundcore app. The app also lets you play around with the noise cancelling, which was surprisingly good and honestly on par with much more expensive options. I would say this would be a GREAT gift for high school/college-level students and even for those who just want something affordable with ANC. I tried them on a 3-hour domestic flight and it did a phenomenal job of drowning out the standard cabin noises, including a crying toddler! I never got to test out the full capacity of the battery but this thing is rated for 40 hours with the ANC on and 55 hours with the ANC turned off, which is entirely very impressive. I wouldn\'t recommend these for those who want to use these primarily for phone and conference calls as the microphone isn\'t particularly great. I don\'t know if it\'s the noise reducing microphones or what but the people I spoke with mentioned that I didn\'t sound all that clear, if anything a little ""distant"" from the mic itself. Overall, though, a great budget option for people seeking a reasonably-priced, ANC-compatible b/t headset.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are not the first Soundcore or Anker product I have owned. I have a set of Soundcore earbuds and a few of their charging cables. Like Anker’s other products, these headphones are a reasonable price and an excellent value for the performance they offer. Pros 1. Solid build quality and comfortable to wear. The hinges that allow them to fold for storage are tight and there is no squeaky plastic sound when adjusting them or wearing them. Plastics are nicely textured with a subtle design. I am bald and the headband is nicely cushioned for wearing for longer periods. My wife and daughter have braids and they said they fit well with no pulling from hair getting caught in hinges and plenty of adjustment. 2. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is effective and has a lot of adjustments to fit your use – allowing you to pick different levels, use an adaptive setting that adjust with background noise, and a few options to allow audio pass through for conversations or awareness (like walking on a street). With full noise cancelling on at moderate volume – all background noise and most conversations are blocked out (I have actually missed people talking to me completely with the volume up). 3. Physical buttons for volume, noise cancelling mode changes, play/pause, and power/pairing which are far more reliable than touch controls that some headphones have. 4. Good sound quality with high quality audio over Bluetooth (LDAC) support and a lot of audio adjustments via the Soundcore app. The app offers an audio test to help you set your equalizer settings – which is cool, but I still had to make some tweaks to the equalizer to get the bass where I wanted – overall volume and clarity are good. 5. Excellent battery life. I have not had to recharge them yet, but in the 5 days I have owned them, I am averaging around 2% per hour of listening with LDAC and noise cancelling enabled (this is in line or a little better than the 40 hours provided by Anker in the specs with these features enabled – it is 55 hours LDAC and ANC off). 6. Wired operation (with an included 4ft headphone cable) is available for devices that don’t support Bluetooth and you can even use it as a headset for calls via the wire. 7. Works well as a headset and even has a wind noise reduction option via the Soundcore app. I didn’t test this in a windy place, but phone calls I took while wearing them around the house were clear on my end and people on the other end said I sounded as good or better than when using my cellphone. 8. Wearing detection works great to pause playback if you take the headphones off (once you configure it in the app). Things to Consider 1. The Soundcore app is excellent, but also required to get the most out of these headphones. Default audio settings are just adequate, and these really work better with the equalizer available in the app. You also have to use the app to enable hi-res audio and wearing detection. Just make sure to disable any default equalizers in your phone audio settings to avoid conflicts with the app's equalizer (I was getting some weird reverb from having my Motorola’s default Dolby audio enhancements on with the Soundcore equalizer)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression was that these matte black headphones are slick and have a sophisticated flair to them. Although they are mostly plastic, they seem well-built, and I hope they last. I was very pleased that there wasn't any creaking. The headphones have ample flexibility, and the cups are decently adjustable. Now, they are very well padded and super soft –both on the cups and the headband. Although there is light clamping force, they still stay on during walks and normal head movement. They are quite light, so I experienced almost no fatigue during long sessions. They do get a bit hot though. I also tried them with a hat and glasses with no issues. The Space Ones feature Bluetooth 5.3 so pairing them was easy. I did not notice any real issues at normal distances and encountered little to no lag or sync issues. There is an option for multiple point connection, but that would disable the LDAC capability. The ANC/ambient sound modes worked great. Although I could still hear higher pitch sounds, it made listening in crowded and traffic settings a good experience. The ambient mode made things sound a bit unnatural, but it is welcomed when awareness is needed. I love that these headphones can be muted with ambient mode by cupping the left cup. Also, while I found it a bit inconsistent, there is a speak-to-mute option as well. To top it off, the cups have auto-pause/play when taking the headset off or putting it on. The call quality is good. It is still very obvious that I was on Bluetooth, but I was heard clearly. I did pick up a bit of wind noise, but it was no big deal due to the wind-reduction mode. The battery life is superb. With ANC/Ambient on, Soundcore claims 40 hours and I am inclined to believe it, since I haven't had the need to charge them after almost 4 days. It can go 55 hours plus without ANC/Ambient on. I am also glad that there is fast-charging where 5 minutes on the charger gives 4 hours of playtime. One thing to note is that LDAC will drain the battery faster. Should the battery be completely drained, you can always use the 3.5mm cable (if your device supports that). You can control all functions from the tactile buttons on the cups, and that is a plus for me. The controls are responsive, and I prefer them to touch controls –especially in cold weather. The default audio is what impressed me the most. While I love listening to high quality sound from a critical standpoint, the Space Ones delivered a very pleasant sound signature. I found that the bass is a bit restrained but precise. The middle is well represented, making vocals, choruses, rhythm, instruments, and dialogue stand out well. The treble adds clarity without being harsh. There is ample soundstage and imaging with great channel separation. This is even more impressive once LDAC is activated on a supported device. Although subtle, I found that I appreciated the sound signature best with ANC on. Just in case, you can always customize the sound with the presets and full-range EQ on the app. Speaking of the app, I would highly recommend downloading it as it provides more options such as firmware updates, ANC/Ambient levels, control settings, LDAC support, multipoint, and many more. If there is anything to nitpick, I’d say that the carrying bag is disappointing, and I wish there were more options for the function button. In the end, you can easily say that I am overly impressed with the Space Ones, and certainly recommend checking them out. While definitely not audiophile quality level, or bass-head oriented, they are very pleasant to listen to. They are jammed packed with features that many more expensive headsets lack or are almost at the same level, and for the asking price, these are hard to pass."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these as a gift to myself and I couldn’t be happier!! The sound quality makes me feel immersed in whatever I am listening to. Love the options the app provides too! I learned a lot about what my sound preferences are by adjusting the different options available. Listening to music while I work with these on has helped my focus 10x more than just listening from my iPad or tv. The are sleek looking and the headband & ear cushions are so smooth too! The fold into a compact easy to travel with size & charge INCREDIBLY quick! Only have 5 mins to charge before you leave the house? You get more than a few hours worth of power. Can’t stress enough how ecstatic I am with these Soundcore headphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: LIGHT - These Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones are the lightest headphones I\'ve ever worn (and I\'ve worn many). COMFORT - It is clear that Anker wanted to ensure that comfort was one of its priorities because these are VERY comfortable to wear. The ear cups are large for all ear sizes and the weight distribution is very balanced. OPTIONS - To get the most out of these, you will need the Soundcore app which allows you to equalize and set up your own sound profile. It also has 22 preset EQ settings depending on the music you like. Audio jack and cable included! Transparent mode allows you to listen to your environment. TECHNOLOGY - Noise cancelling features are excellent especially while music is playing simultaneously. They have ""Adaptive Noise Cancelling"" which is supposed to adjust with your environment, although it\'s sort of hard to tell what changes. CHARGE - 5 min charge gets you 4hrs and a full charge gets you 40-55 hrs. USB-C cable included, but no wall plug SOUND QUALITY - So crisp and adaptible. CONS: PORTABILITY - These don\'t fold so if you\'re carrying them, they\'ll be full size. This is understandable though because less hinges means the headphones remain lighter. BUTTONS - Lots of newer headphones have touch and slide features on the sides of headphones, these have buttons. On the other hand, it\'s good to have that tactile feel, but this one is up to user preference. DURABILITY? - I put a question mark on this because only time will tell. However, I\'m skeptical of the soft material on the ear cups and the upper headband. At least the headphones come with a duffel carrying pouch to protect them. Bass? Check. Mids? Check. Treble? Check. Highs? Check. I highly recommend these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My honest review for the sound core headphones, let me start off by saying this headphones are probably one of the best mid priced in the market. My review will be based on 4 features on a scale from 1 to 10 / Style/ Comfortability/ Sound and Specs. Style: based on my experience the style is great but not the best looking, it lacks a bit of a modern feel. The material tends to have a fingerprint magnet, I am constantly needing to clean my headphones. Other than that I like color way. Comfortability: I have big ears and with that my ears get tired when using over the head headphones, with these Soundcore I have been really impressed. I use my headphones mostly the entire day and have not had any complaints or felt my ears sore from use all day. The material on the ear cups have a soft foam with leather and big enough to cover around the ear. The band is also made of the same material and comfortable. Sound: by far best sound I’ve had for a mid priced headphones, the audio quality is very premium. The audio drivers are very well designed making it a perfect balance. I’ve tried the audio with a different big brand and listened to 8D music and by far the sound is very crisp on these Soundcore headsets. Specs: one the best features it has is the ability to have two different devices connected at the same time. I work in the office and use my headphones for music and have a laptop connected so I can hear if anyone messages me. This is an awesome feature. Another great feature is the ANC support, I tell you it blocks everyone out when having it turned on. The best feature from this headphone is the battery! One of the best batteries I’ve had to experiment. I can charge my headphones one time and use it the whole week with ANC turned on and will have battery life at Medium charge. I will stand by this and proved to have the best battery life. Final: If you’re looking for a great headset that has amazing battery life, great audio performance and great comfortable design. Then this headphones are for you. It may not have the best styles but with other great features that makes up that part. I give this headphones 9.0 out of 10 or 4.5 Stars. A great pair to have.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m so happy I decided to try this brand! The look of the headphones is so sleek and beautiful. You don’t need to buy beats. Look into other alternatives like I did bcuz these beat out the best. The ear pieces sit comfortably on your head and ears, but of course, pressure overtime will start to feel slightly uncomfortable, but these don’t!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They work very well. I wish they were slightly lower profile for fit. Connecting is seemless and battery life is great. The noise cancelling and ambient option for sound is a huge plus. Sound quality is adequate. I have to spend more time with them to get a full picture of the range but hey seem very clear. My father was raving about the clarity of the microphone for a conversation we had for an hour. For the price its hard to ""beat.""']"
Open Box - Soundcore by Anker Space One Over-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$103.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/open-box-soundcore-by-anker-space-one-over-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-black/17935942/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The two main things that drew me to this headset is that I find them to be very attractive and have been a fan of Soundcore in the past. The price for what you get here is insane. As you normally don’t get all the features at this price point. But with that said the features themselves do not perform at the same level as more expensive headphones. But are a solid pick for those looking for budget headphones as these may be hard to beat when you look wholistically at them. COMFORT: It is almost entirely made of plastic. It feels solid, but lightweight. Also, I didn’t notice any creaking. But not sure who these would fair with a big drop or aggressive use. It has plastic notches for the headband itself which can fit small to large heads. They feel good and it stays in place well. The earcups themselves move slightly anteriorly (forward) but fully posteriorly (backward). They also tilt just a bit. Clamping force is very light. To the point that if I shake my head they come off. Which makes them a bit frustrating when working out. As if you have a lot of movement or are lying down they will require adjustment to stay on. The foam of the earpads is solid. It’s not top of the line but not bad either. Quite soft and plushy but not amazing. In general I find them to be comfortable. I can wear them for long periods without issues. But aren’t the most comfortable things I’ve tried either. I’d probably give them a 7/10. SOUND: It is good, I’d say a 6/10 when compared to headphones that are much more expensive than them and an 8/10 for others in the same price range. It isn’t groundbreaking or something that will blow your socks off. You won’t be hearing anything new that you haven’t heard before. As these are budget headphones and I don’t want to give you unrealistic expectations. With that said for the price I think they sound great. You can easily differentiate different sounds in songs. Vocals sound clear. But it lacks sparkle that the more expensive guys will give you that will rock your soul. Which again, I wouldn’t expect at this price range. Bass is light, but present. Mids are bit recessed and muddy. Highs are slightly sharp but clear. Sounds are mostly accurate but do sound very mildly processed. I’m happy to sit and listen to music while working or working out. Also use them to watch shows/media (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). With that I do notice slight latency if I’m being hyper critical with talking videos. But if I want critical listening, I reach for something else. FEATURES: For the price I am shocked at how many features this thing packs. Some of these features require you to go into the SoundCore App to enable. Such as wear detection. Which works relatively well. It is mildly delayed where it takes about a second to play/pause the media both when taking it off and putting it back on. It comes with noise cancelling. It is meh performance wise. Where it slightly mutes or reduces lower end sounds while changing the pitch of medium or higher pitched sounds making them less noticeable. Over actually cancelling them like more expensive headphones. I’d rate the overall ANC as a 5/10. The seal of the headphone itself isn’t significant but does most of the work (passive noise cancelling). The transparency mode is solid. I found it lets in a good amount of noise allowing me to hear what is going on around me and allows me to have a conversation without too much trouble. But isn’t to the level of Apples transparency. When you first power on the headset it will say connected along with the battery level which I like. It will also announce when it is in pairing mode and when the battery is low. I found the alerts themselves were the right volume of not being deafening nor too quiet where you can’t hear what it is saying. The App itself is great. It adds a lot of features and is worth checking out. One interesting point is the “heardID” which should give you better sound based on your personal hearing. This didn’t work well for me. You also have access to a custom EQ (8 band 100, 200, 400, 800, 1.6k, 3.2k, 6.4k, and 12.8k). You can have multiple custom EQ’s saved. There are multiple preset sounds you can select. I chose “Soundcore Signature” as I figure that is what most people will leave it on as that is the default mode. Quick spewing of a bunch of other features in a single paragraph. “Easy chat” (turn on in app first) that enables transparency mode if you hold left side of earcup. Works well. Also, has a speak to enable. Which does the same thing and will enable when it thinks it hears a voice. Which turns off after stop speaking for 5 seconds or pressing NC button. I like that you can cancel this manually. “Safe volume” will limit how loud the headphones can get. But found that it isn’t necessary on these as they don’t get very loud (on my iPhone 14 Pro Max) as the max I got was about 78 dB at full volume. I did find if I had this enabled that it would make everything quieter way before it got close to the limit I had placed so left it off. Dual connections. Auto power off (30, 60, 90, 120, never). Voice prompt for battery and ambient sound. For the price the features are actually insane. There is also a 3.5 mm jack (which is included) for wired listening and it does not need to be powered on for that. USB-C for charging. Great battery life. CONTROLS: On the left earcup on the bottom you have your power on/off. If you long press that when powering on it will go into pairing mode. Just above that is the noise cancelling, transparency, or normal mode. I like that it actually says the mode over giving you a vague tone. If you double tap the top button it goes between normal mode and bass boost. Unfortunately, this double tap doesn’t work all the time and is finicky with timing. On the right earcup you have your play/pause. Which is finicky and doesn’t always work on first try and there is a bit of a delay. Skip forward/backward is not supported. Or at least that I could figure out as multiple presses to the button does nothing. Just above that you have your volume up and down button. All buttons feel the same without variance, with a satisfying bump when clicked and a quiet click. You do get mild microphonics in the earcup when messing with them.

And I think if you gave them to others and had them try them out, they would think they are more expensive than they are.

It can go 55 hours plus without ANC/Ambient on. I am also glad that there is fast-charging where 5 minutes on the charger gives 4 hours of playtime. One thing to note is that LDAC will drain the battery faster. Should the battery be completely drained, you can always use the 3.5mm cable (if your device supports that). You can control all functions from the tactile buttons on the cups, and that is a plus for me. The controls are responsive, and I prefer them to touch controls –especially in cold weather. The default audio is what impressed me the most. While I love listening to high quality sound from a critical standpoint, the Space Ones delivered a very pleasant sound signature. I found that the bass is a bit restrained but precise. The middle is well represented, making vocals, choruses, rhythm, instruments, and dialogue stand out well. The treble adds clarity without being harsh. There is ample soundstage and imaging with great channel separation. This is even more impressive once LDAC is activated on a supported device. Although subtle, I found that I appreciated the sound signature best with ANC on. Just in case, you can always customize the sound with the presets and full-range EQ on the app. Speaking of the app, I would highly recommend downloading it as it provides more options such as firmware updates, ANC/Ambient levels, control settings, LDAC support, multipoint, and many more. If there is anything to nitpick, I’d say that the carrying bag is disappointing, and I wish there were more options for the function button. In the end, you can easily say that I am overly impressed with the Space Ones, and certainly recommend checking them out. While definitely not audiophile quality level, or bass-head oriented, they are very pleasant to listen to. They are jammed packed with features that many more expensive headsets lack or are almost at the same level, and for the asking price, these are hard to pass."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these as a gift to myself and I couldn’t be happier!! The sound quality makes me feel immersed in whatever I am listening to. Love the options the app provides too! I learned a lot about what my sound preferences are by adjusting the different options available. Listening to music while I work with these on has helped my focus 10x more than just listening from my iPad or tv. The are sleek looking and the headband & ear cushions are so smooth too! The fold into a compact easy to travel with size & charge INCREDIBLY quick! Only have 5 mins to charge before you leave the house? You get more than a few hours worth of power. Can’t stress enough how ecstatic I am with these Soundcore headphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: LIGHT - These Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones are the lightest headphones I\'ve ever worn (and I\'ve worn many). COMFORT - It is clear that Anker wanted to ensure that comfort was one of its priorities because these are VERY comfortable to wear. The ear cups are large for all ear sizes and the weight distribution is very balanced. OPTIONS - To get the most out of these, you will need the Soundcore app which allows you to equalize and set up your own sound profile. It also has 22 preset EQ settings depending on the music you like. Audio jack and cable included! Transparent mode allows you to listen to your environment. TECHNOLOGY - Noise cancelling features are excellent especially while music is playing simultaneously. They have ""Adaptive Noise Cancelling"" which is supposed to adjust with your environment, although it\'s sort of hard to tell what changes. CHARGE - 5 min charge gets you 4hrs and a full charge gets you 40-55 hrs. USB-C cable included, but no wall plug SOUND QUALITY - So crisp and adaptible. CONS: PORTABILITY - These don\'t fold so if you\'re carrying them, they\'ll be full size. This is understandable though because less hinges means the headphones remain lighter. BUTTONS - Lots of newer headphones have touch and slide features on the sides of headphones, these have buttons. On the other hand, it\'s good to have that tactile feel, but this one is up to user preference. DURABILITY? - I put a question mark on this because only time will tell. However, I\'m skeptical of the soft material on the ear cups and the upper headband. At least the headphones come with a duffel carrying pouch to protect them. Bass? Check. Mids? Check. Treble? Check. Highs? Check. I highly recommend these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My honest review for the sound core headphones, let me start off by saying this headphones are probably one of the best mid priced in the market. My review will be based on 4 features on a scale from 1 to 10 / Style/ Comfortability/ Sound and Specs. Style: based on my experience the style is great but not the best looking, it lacks a bit of a modern feel. The material tends to have a fingerprint magnet, I am constantly needing to clean my headphones. Other than that I like color way. Comfortability: I have big ears and with that my ears get tired when using over the head headphones, with these Soundcore I have been really impressed. I use my headphones mostly the entire day and have not had any complaints or felt my ears sore from use all day. The material on the ear cups have a soft foam with leather and big enough to cover around the ear. The band is also made of the same material and comfortable. Sound: by far best sound I’ve had for a mid priced headphones, the audio quality is very premium. The audio drivers are very well designed making it a perfect balance. I’ve tried the audio with a different big brand and listened to 8D music and by far the sound is very crisp on these Soundcore headsets. Specs: one the best features it has is the ability to have two different devices connected at the same time. I work in the office and use my headphones for music and have a laptop connected so I can hear if anyone messages me. This is an awesome feature. Another great feature is the ANC support, I tell you it blocks everyone out when having it turned on. The best feature from this headphone is the battery! One of the best batteries I’ve had to experiment. I can charge my headphones one time and use it the whole week with ANC turned on and will have battery life at Medium charge. I will stand by this and proved to have the best battery life. Final: If you’re looking for a great headset that has amazing battery life, great audio performance and great comfortable design. Then this headphones are for you. It may not have the best styles but with other great features that makes up that part. I give this headphones 9.0 out of 10 or 4.5 Stars. A great pair to have.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m so happy I decided to try this brand! The look of the headphones is so sleek and beautiful. You don’t need to buy beats. Look into other alternatives like I did bcuz these beat out the best. The ear pieces sit comfortably on your head and ears, but of course, pressure overtime will start to feel slightly uncomfortable, but these don’t!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They work very well. I wish they were slightly lower profile for fit. Connecting is seemless and battery life is great. The noise cancelling and ambient option for sound is a huge plus. Sound quality is adequate. I have to spend more time with them to get a full picture of the range but hey seem very clear. My father was raving about the clarity of the microphone for a conversation we had for an hour. For the price its hard to ""beat.""']"
Razer Barracuda X Plus Wireless Gaming Headset for PC/PS5/PS4/Switch - Quartz,$99.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/razer-barracuda-x-plus-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-quartz/16206972/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When it comes to Razer headphones, I can't say I've ever been a big fanboy. For a variety of comfort, sound, and sometimes even software support difficulties, I've tried and passed on several wired/wireless incarnations of the Kraken, Nari, and Blackshark. The Barracuda X, on the other hand, came out of nowhere to completely exceed my expectations and deliver some outstanding gaming and multimedia performance on both the PC and Switch, all while resolving some of the comfort issues that plagued some of their past outings. All of this was available without the need for Razer's Synapse client, which can be bloated and resource-intensive at times. To be honest, I didn't think the Barracuda X would be a keeper. But it was a surprise and must keep for gamers , Strongly recommend this headset to all gamers."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset was easy to set up right out of the box. It has a good range, I was able to go downstairs and still connect. It has a long battery life and the sound quality is great for a wireless headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Barracuda X gaming headphones have an incredible sound quality and are extremely comfortable. The foam on the earphones is thick and so comfortable that you forget you are using headphones. These headphones have a wide range of different uses from having the wireless connection ability to also having to separate plug in options! These also are very good at noise cancellation and I cannot hear things outside of the headphones. The only thing I noticed could be improved was the quality of the plastic, the buttons seemed a little cheap but the overall function of the headphones, the sound and the noise cancelling ability was very impressive! I would absolutely recommend these headphones if you’re a gamer or even just work from home and need something comfortable you can wear all day!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always love Razer products so it’s no surprise how much I like these! Everything you need is in the box! Charger, mic, Bluetooth adapter and usb-c adapter, so no need to worry if they will connect to your device! This completely eliminates the issue of having to go back to the store to make your product work which is super annoying. I’m really happy with the sound quality of these headphones as well. The lay nice and flat like, which I think is a great design feature. Additionally, they are metal inside, (I included a pic) so these are very sturdy, and built to last, so you likely won’t need new headphones for a long time! These deserve 10 stars! I noticed their was a review left saying that you can’t see which side the mic works on, but you can! It’s labeled on the mic with a little symbol!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Barracuda X is an awesome value for a great quality, comfortable headset. Using with Android, Switch or PS4 is also pretty seamless. I really loved the Barracuda X with my Switch - being able to use them wirelessly is a lot more flexible, and you can always use the included 3.5mm cable to plug them in if you need to charge at the same time. The microphone can be disconnected if you don’t plan on using it but, the sound quality is exceptional. As far as the microphone, people say they can hear me just fine, so i assume it works well too. When playing competitive shooters, I was able to tell what direction gunfire and footsteps were coming from with them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The packaging was amazing and beautiful.The instructions are clear and concise. Overall headphones fit and wear beautifully. The Razer Barracuda X has a unique version of connectivity. It does not use Bluetooth. It uses a USB C dongle that instantly connects. I can switch that between my Galaxy, my PS4, my switch and my PC - just by moving the dongle to the new device. (On the PC I also have to change the sound output in settings). If I want to use it on my iPod I Can use the 3.5mm analog cable in wired mode. The headphones controls are easy to understand and use- for volume and answering calls. The surround sound is excellent, allowing me to get more kills in FPS matches I use my headphones for music listening as well, and enjoy marathon Spotify sessions with excellent clarity and dynamic sound response. The Bass is clear and the highs are solid. The mic is awesome. It only picks me up, which is great. My little sister is always busting in my room trying to say hello to my team or crack a joke about me getting sniped - They cant hear it. They can hear me however- and that makes for better matches and more wins.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The volume dial was broke on the first pair. The second pair's right headband will not stay tight."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the best quality pink headset I have been able to find! I had one issue with this product.. the dongle wire does not work when the USB wire is coiled up. I thought the dongle was broken, but was able to fix the issue once I fully opened the wire. The audio and mic quality are so much better when using the dongle compared to bluetooth, but I still appreciate that there is an option for bluetooth. The battery life is great and mic quality is one of the best I have heard in a headset microphone. Just remember if you are having problems connecting the dongle using the USB cable try to fully unravel the wire and then connect it again.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros Lightweight and comfortable - designed to be worn for hours. Wireless - as one who uses a studio microphone having the ability to wear the headset away from the desk and still talk is a plus. In addition, the wireless range is great! The detachable microphone is nice when you want to use a different mic, play solo, or just listen to music. It offers crisp treble frequencies. Cons Some difficulty noted in the lower frequencies but not a big deal. Mic has some static at times - I recorded myself reading and noticed there was some static at times while I was talking. Not as crisp as I prefer but Overall great product!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have had the headset for 5 months now and overall I really like it. It's cute, comfortable, and sounds great. However There have been a few times when the audio cuts and won't come back until I unplug the dongle. It maybe happens once a month? More recently, the audio stopped working in one ear until I started moving that piece around and fixed it. Haven't had that issue again since. Only other issue I experienced was with the mic. I unplugged the mic and thought it was back in properly but apparently not bc I blasted the ears of my friends while in a call. Just had to replug it in a few times to fix it. Overall I think this is a pretty good headset (especially when it's on sale).""]"
JBL Quantum 910X Wireless Gaming Headset - Black/Green,$329.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-quantum-910x-wireless-gaming-headset-black-green/17243421/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Received the new JBL Quantum 910x wireless headphones last week and have been impressed with them ever since. Well packaged and include everything you need, including a nice bag to keep your headphones and accessories in, see pictures. The headphones themselves are well padded and very comfortable. The flip up to mute microphone is a nice and convenient option and the battery charge lasts plenty long. The sound quality is exceptional and the spatial tracking works very well, giving an entirely different perspective to game play if you’ve never used it before. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking and hope they last me for years!', ""I received these headphones in return for my honest review. My son is so thankful for these headphones and he says they are the new best thing! We love the box it came in and the majority of instructions are basic . They last for ages after being fully charged so there's no interruption when my son is playing his computer. He loves the comfort that these headphones give so there's no interruption when he's playing and there is discomfort neither. They come with everything that you need so need to fork any more money out . At first I did think the price for these was very expensive but after what my son has told me and what u have seen I think it's great value for money. You are definitely getting your moneys worth ."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just want to say that these headphones blew me away with sound, design, and long battery life. I love how quick they connected to my Xbox Series X and after that I was gaming in my living room for hours. Got in on a party chat with my friends and they heard me loud and clear. No static and they had plenty of volume for any game. Played some Halo Infinite and some Forza Horizon. The sound had some good punchy bass and had a great surround sound feeling. Even tried some Apple Music songs and the 50mm drivers really hit some good highs and mids just right. No complaints in the sound area. Back to party chat. I loved the feature of flicking up the mic to mute. Turns red when muted. Super convenient when you need a bathroom break. Lol Also cool that you can independently switch the sound of the game chat/game sound on the headset. Pretty nifty. The material for the cushion is really good quality and never bothered me when I was gaming. Super comfy. Came with all the accessories you would need for Pc, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Mac, and mobile. Cool little feature also is that you can charge them and game at the same time. If I had to give it a negative.. The little dongle is small and can get lost if you misplace it. But overall a solid pair of killer headphones. Now back to gaming!', ""After several weeks of using the JBL Quantum 910X, I'm genuinely impressed. As an avid gamer, audio quality is paramount to me, and this headset delivers exactly a high and real experience I tested playing Assassins Creed, Alone in The Dark, Resident Evil 4. The headset creates an immersive experience, making me feel like I'm inside the game. It's particularly noticeable in games where directional audio are the key The Active Noise Cancelling is a game-changer, blocking out external distractions and allowing me to focus. The low latency connection means no annoying lag, keeping me in sync with fast-paced action. The comfort level is top-notch. The memory foam ear cushions mean I can game for hours without discomfort, a must for long gaming sessions. And the battery life? Phenomenal. I rarely worry about it running out mid-game. The cables are top quality, 3.5mm audio braided audio cable, i liked that it's matching the green colout theme and it has enough lenght to not disturb my game. A USB-A to USB C charging cable and a calibration cable (which to me was the innovative one) - It can be done on one of your ears The software to set your customizations and set different sound styles can be done via Desktop (PC , don't have MAC so can't comment on that) However, there are a couple of downsides. The headset's advanced features are fully available only on PC, which can be a drawback for console gamers wanting to utilize all its capabilities. Also, the price point might be steep for casual gamers. Overall, the JBL Quantum 910X is a solid investment for serious gamers seeking an edge in audio quality and immersion. It's not just a headset; it's a critical tool in my gaming arsenal."", ""These are very comfortable headphones, I Don't mind wearing them while playing for long periods, the sound quality is good but not excellent I have had headphones cheaper that have the same quality sound. Online playing fps the surround is good so that you have an idea of where the shot came from or where other players are. The lights are a nice touch and you can change the colours, for me that's just a gimmick (not something I look for). People that have played on my team have said the my voice comes across well on their side which is good. My only real problem was the sound adjust on the back. When resting my head back sometimes the volume will change."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The packaging was well thought out and assembled with quality material. It's a great feeling to get ahold of a quality new product. Details were paid attention to and removing all the cords, adapters, and the headphones themselves, along with their storage pouch was satisfying. Cables are made of a premium feeling material and feel like they will hold up to normal wear and tear. USB and wireless dongles feel tight, with no creaks. The headset itself has wonderfully comfortable earpads and headband material. After hours of use, this headset is nonfatiguing. It sits comfortably on my head and around my ears, causing minimal discomfort. No complaints with extended use. The sound produced is robust and satisfying. It may not be loud enough for those with types of hearing damage, however, but I found it to be adequate. The mic picks up my voice very well and produces a natural sound for others to hear. It flips up and has a satisfying click to indicate mute and a red-led visual queue. It feels well-built and again feels like it will stand up to normal wear. Buttons, volume wheels and the on/off slider switch all feel solid and are nice to use. Detail to such things makes any product feel better. Aural positioning in game is wonderful. with ANC turned on, these things put you in a quiet environment that helps immerse yourself into whatever you are playing. Head tracking works as expected and is nice. Talk-through works reasonably well and allows you to carry on a conversation if needed without stopping what you are doing. Connecting to the supplied USB wireless dongle was easy and quick. The connection was solid and I experienced no dropouts or lag in the audio. This rig comes with multi-zone lights and will put on a light show if desired It's all customizable within the JBL QuantamEngine app. The app provides access to all the settings and customizations you could want, and then some. Descriptions of functions are present and it's easily understood. It's a well-thought-out app and integrates beautifully with the headset. When turned on, the spatial sound makes quite a difference in audio reproduction and is a joy to experience. game and master volume dials on the headset let you get the audio set to your liking. This is a very competent entry into the gaming headset space. Very much recommend it to anyone looking for premium material, immersive sounding, and all the options you could want. The box has a quote on its front, Sound is survival. Agreed. Put this on your head and enjoy hours of noise canceled, 7.1 surround, environment rendering audio bliss."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used to not use gaming headsets but man does it make a difference in sound quality and sound awareness. If you play online games it makes a huge difference, for example on Fortnite, when you can tell exactly where a sound is coming from your opponents or whatever, compared to your tv audio. It's a real advantage to have it. Great bass sound, super comfortable. Stylish as heck too, especially for an Xbox system like this was designed to mimic. Cool green colors that glow and move around the ear pieces themselves. Great design and sound all the way around. They do also work for Playstation and computer and such, so they'd also make a great work pair if you wanted. Comes with all the accessories you'd need and more. Even has an adapter for going from the USB to a USB-C if you need to do that on newer devices, which is a nice extra feature."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used the JBL Quantum 910X on my pc. They worked great. I didn't have any connections issues. Although I mainly used them plugged in. Audio sounded great. They are very comfortable the padding is nice.

I wear glasses so I sometimes have issue with comfort, but not these.The bag that came with the headphones is nice too."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound and quality. Combined with a awesome look. The noise cancelling is great for gaming it cuts out all background noise. The charge a lot faster then I expected. There really easy to connect to my Xbox. The Quantumsound Drivers create awesome sound during games. Chatting on the Headset is very clear and easy to hear', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tried the JBL Quantum 910X headset and, wow, what sound! I found that it not only had the great low-end sound when needed but the immersive clarity of the audio was amazing. It’s so sharp that you can have surround sound in a headset. Clean, crisp, and punch when I needed it. The JBL sound! So connecting the headset via Bluetooth was quick and painless. It seemed to snap connect right into place. Connected to the left ear cup was the removeable boom mic, that when lifted, goes into mute mode. When lowered the mic is immediately back on and ready for smack talk with your gaming friends. The box contains USB C and A adaptors, charging cable, a windsock/windscreen for the mic for all the jumping around and moving your head. An audio cable if you’re for whatever reason you lose Bluetooth connectivity. As well as several tutorials and registration guides to help you through setup. I, for one, am very impressed with the sound, feel, and look of this game headset. And by the way the aesthetics of the green illumination on the ear cups looks very cool.']"

The sound quality is exceptional, with crystal clear audio and a rich, full-bodied bass that adds depth and richness to my music. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality listening experience. The battery retains its charge for an extended period of time, allowing you to use your device without worrying about running out of power too quickly."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sent by influenster to test and review. I must say I’ve really enjoyed testing these ear buds. The sound quality is great I would say as good as my beats studios. I was surprised how good the mic was with how far they are from my mouth but the caller could hear me very clearly. I would say the battery is long lasting as I’ve used the several times and not had to recharge them as of yet. For ear buds I found them very comfortable and they came with several sizes to try.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound is great with many features such as bass boost, equaliser and the functions to control the music/video through tapping the headphones.However for the price they are they do not scream “luxury” to me, they feel like a cheap plastic (especially the casing) and even with changing the bud size they can still get uncomfortable if you move when led down.Compared the sports version the true wireless headphones do not match sennheisers standards in my opinion.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They come in a cardboard box as can be seen on the pictures. When you open it the earbuds have their own plastic pocket size case. They’re really easy to set up once you find them on Bluetooth. Something I’ve not seen before is they come with various sizes of earbuds for different ear canal sizes. If you like earbuds that cancel out background noise these are certainly the ones you need they do it fantastically. The sound itself is also really good I’ve listened to podcasts and music with them and you can really block out the world whilst you kick back and relax! The best earbuds I’ve ever owned.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are fantastic headphones, they deliver a high end sound quality, have an excellent battery life and great build quality. The headphones include different size silicone ear adapters, the standard size fit me, while the smaller size fits my wife. I found the adapters easy to change and fit. The headphones stay in, even with heavy movement, are easy to put in and take out and are extremely comfortable even for long periods of time. The charging case is small and functional. The setup is simple with clear instructions, paring is straightforward and the gestures are easy to remember.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earphones are amazing, everything needed was in the box. Included was a number of spare tips, a charging case and cables. These were super easy to install, I installed the accompanying app and followed the instructions. The buds automatically updated themselves and i was ready to go. Sound quality is great, you can also adjust the equaliser to tune the sound. In the app you can also customize the button presses, I have never seen this before! The buds have noise cancelling and pass-thru. I was cleaning my car with a vacuum and turned on NC, the sound of the vacuum was almost completely removed. Battery life is great and the distance the buds connect is great. Over all I fully recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these! Usually I wear over ear headphones as in the past I've found earbuds uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. These are so much better. The changeable pieces for your ears allow you to find the most comfortable set. The sound quality is great, the bass notes nice and rumbly. It connects easily through Bluetooth, it isn't complicated. With the case also being a charger it can last for ages without needing to be plugged in too. I'd highly recommend these."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Having used these for a couple of days now, I am really pleased with this Earbuds. I found that music streaming was surprisingly good quality. Very clear sound, bass is amazing, absolutely easy and comfortable to wear for prolonged periods, fit is nice and snug so no worries about them falling out whilst active. Magnetic and holds the charge well and really quick. When you put the earbuds back in the case/charger, they switch off and get charged up to full. long battery life too! Very easy to pair with a variety of different devices, controls are easy to navigate , overall a great performance , sturdy build for a high quality pair of headphones. The case/charger is beautifully designed, Small and practical, only about 6x5x2cm and fits in a pocket or handbag easily so can be taken everywhere and won't take up much space. Absolutely love this and 20 stars!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Can’t believe I never had a pair of earphones like this , the sound quality is amazing and the way they cut all noise out , didn’t know they was a app that you can download and add more bass and stuff like that they connected easy to may iPhone and really fit nice in the ear .']"

TLDR - great pair of wireless noise canceling headphones that comes in at half or less than half the price of other competitors. Pros: > Great battery life: i got ~60 hours of use without NC & ~45 hours with NC; in both scenarios, i typically listen to music/podcasts ~60% volume. > Sound quality: sound signature for me personally was great, i’m not necessarily an audiophile, but liked the out of the box settings & found the EQ from the app to be pretty good. > Noise Cancellation & Transparency: these do a very good job of canceling noise, given that they are coming in at half the price of ones that completely cancel noise!

Additionally, you get an NC button that cycles through NC mode, transparency mode, or off for both NC & transparency (this particular button can be customized via the app to perform other actions). I think the placement/layout of these buttons are very intuitive and took me very little time to build my muscle memory for where they were. > Portability: the Q45s can fold pretty easily and also come with a hard shell case.

At this price point, this is probably the best bang for the buck you can get for a wireless NC pair of cans. Would highly recommend the Space Q45s to anyone that is in looking to get a pair of NC headphones. Don’t let the price fool you!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My husband is retired and home all the time now. I have been working from home ever since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Working from home has meant an increase in virtual meetings, seminars and classes. Before my husband retired, my home workplace was nice and quiet, but now the chance for ambient noise has increased dramatically. That is why I first invested in noise cancelling earbuds. The earbuds worked well, but I just wasn't crazy about how they felt in my ears or about how easy it was to misplace them. Then I tried full-fledged noise-cancelling USB earphones that plugged into my computer and had the microphone that angled in front of your mouth. They also worked well, but kept me tethered to the computer, unless I took them off of my head or unplugged them from the computer and dragged the cord around with me. Awkward! So, when I heard about the Anker Soundcore Q45 True Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones, I couldn't wait to give them a try. I have several other Anker products and I have found them to be thoughtfully designed, easy to use and well functioning. I expected the same from the Space Q45's and I have not been disappointed. From the start, upon removing them from the box, I was impressed by the cleverly designed hard-walled case in which the headphones fit so neatly. Removing the headphones from the case, I was pleased by how soft, padded and pliable the contact areas of the Q45. A USB cable for charging the unit was provided with the Q45. It took about 2 hours for them to be totally charged. There is a Quick Start Guide provided in the box. Directly on the front of the Guide, it points you to the Soundcore Support website. It encourages you to download the Soundcore application to your phone. I am glad I did this, because under the Settings (Gear Icon), I found that there was an update to the device's firmware. I followed the directions and updated the firmware. Then explored the application a bit. There are multiple settings for the Q45 in the app and a listing of helpful Frequently Asked Questions. There is also a download for the full User's Manual. I placed the Q45's on my head, making sure to put the side marked R on the right side. They were so soft and comfortable. I found them to be easily adjusted to snuggly fit to my head. They felt much lighter than the USB wired headphones that I had used before. And, best thing yet, I could get up and move around without being tethered to the computer or removing them. Freedom! I paired up the Q45 via Bluetooth to the laptop that I was going to use for my upcoming class for work. This was a fast and easy feat. I found that the Q45 can be paired with multiple devices, so, I also paired them with my Android phone. I tested out the sound and three listening modes while playing my local NPR station on SimpleRadio. The sound was clear and vibrant. The Noise Canceling mode effectively eliminated the sound of landscaping crew mowing and blowing outside, as well as the cooling fans on my computers. I found pretty much the same result in the Normal mode - still very quiet ambient noise. The Transparency mode allowed me to hear the ambient sounds, but at a reduced, non-distractive level. The next day, I was readying myself for my class. I was a bit disconcerted that there was no microphone arm on the Q45. My fears that this would make the microphone ineffective was proven to be for nothing, as, later, when I was using the Q45's in my Zoom class, my trainers and classmates said that my sound was perfect. What a relief! I am very impressed with the Anker Soundcore Space Q45's. They are everything that I hoped for an untethered experience: great sound, comfortable and lightweight, long battery life and wire-free. A great experience all around!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am blown away by these Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. So far, these are the best noise-canceling headphones I have ever used. With up to 50 hours of playtime is crazy, they will outlast any flight or road trip. They claim up to 98% noise reduction, and I can attest that the noise cancellation capabilities are phenomenal with this set of headphones. What is also great is the transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings. I like to use this mode when grocery shopping or when in a meeting at work or studying when my young kids are around, so I can keep tabs on what’s going on around me. The normal mode of ambient sound shuts off both the transparency mode and noise canceling mode, this saves battery but is also quiet. If I am in my house or wearing these headphones while in bed, normal mode is on. The functionality of the ambient noise features works great! I love that there is a way to toggle wind noise reduction as well. This pair of headphones 2 mics that make phone calls or meetings clear and enjoyable for the people you are talking to. The fit and feel of these Space Q45 Headphones are premium. The ear cups are very soft and plush with a soft memory foam feel that conforms to your head for a cozy yet secure fit. When pressed the memory foam cups have a 1 second reset time that is so satisfying. The pleather is ridiculously soft and feels great on the skin. The headband has great adjustability and is comfortable enough to wear for several hours. There are 9 clicks per side of the headband for precise adjustability. The same plush pleather on the ear cups can be found on the center of the headband facing down toward your head, and it is just as comfortable. There is a nice weight to this pair of headphones but only in a well-built way, as in they aren’t too heavy when you wear them for a while. The overall feel of these headphones is great. The setup was extremely easy and only took a minute. Just connect them to your device via Bluetooth or with the supplied 3.5mm headphone jack cable. I had zero issues connecting my phone, tablets, and computer to these headphones. The best way to get the full potential out of these headphones is to download the Soundcore app which is available on both the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. With the app, you can fine-tune the equalizer to your own custom setting or select one of the 21 preloaded Soundcore Signature equalizer settings. I personally listen to all types of music and found the Soundcore Signature with bass boost to be my favorite. There is so much you can do within the app such as change the ambient sound modes from noise canceling, normal, and transparency mode, set the audio level to the decibel you don’t want to go past, toggle the audio level according to your set limit, set what the ambient button on your headphones do, Equalizer settings, toggle reduce wind reduction, keep your firmware up to date, check out the Anker store, download sound quality software, and more. I recommend downloading the app to get the most out of this pair of headphones. I also recommend downloading the LDAC codec within the sound mode settings. LDAC is a proprietary audio coding technology developed by Sony, which allows streaming high-resolution audio over Bluetooth connections at up to 990 kbps at 24 bit/96 kHz, that’s 3x the data transmitted than normal, so you hear more in-depth sounds and with this pair of headphones, music sounds sooo good! The headphones themselves are very simple to use. There are 4 buttons on the headphones, power, noise canceling, play/pause, and volume up/down. There is also a USB Type-C for charging and a 3.5mm jack port. The look and esthetics are great, I love the big cups, but they aren’t too big. The smooth round edges are modern and sleek and don’t cause a scene but rather a statement, subtly. What comes in the box? The box comes with a pair of headphones, a USB type-A to USB Type-C for charging, a 3.5mm jack cable, a quick start guide, and warranty paperwork, as well as a protective carry case which I thought was really cool that they added that. I love having the option to protect the headphones with a hard zippered case over a soft bag any day, Anker did a great job by adding the hard protective case. Overall, I am in love with these headphones. The sound is incredible. The noise canceling is incredible. The price for what you get is incredible. I recommend these to everyone from students to parents, to the elderly. If you are looking for premium sound in an easy-on-the-eyes pair of headphones, look no further. By far, the pair of headphones I have ever had. I am blown away by these premium headphones from fit to finish to sound quality, I think Anker knocked it out of the park with these.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Do not be mistaken, these headphones are the most impressive in the lineup, behind the AirPods Max in my opinion. They are better than the Sony XM4! They have amazing sound, of course, but here's the thing, only the AirPods Max and Anker Q45 have brilliantly clear transparency modes, which matter a lot to me. But guess what.. here's a shocker... The Anker Q45s are more comfortable than the AirPods Max! My only issue with them are the fact that they do not turn off the videos or music you are listening to when you remove the headphones, but it's not that big of a deal. They also seamlessly switch between devices when audio starts playing on different ones they are paired with, which is another huge win for these. As for me, I bought a set of AirPods Max for the transparancy mode as they are slightly better, but I am surprised at how much I like the Anker Q45. For $99.99, I find them worth keeping around as a second pair. Keep in mind, the AirPods are 5.5x more expensive. If you want the best headphones for a fraction of the cost of the AirPods, it's no contest, this is it. Forgot to mention, I also bought the Sony XM4s on sale but I am returning those. Final note, the travel case these come in are okay, but not better than Sony one."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I currently own a number of Anker devices, from phone chargers to USB ports, power banks, & bluetooth speakers. The quality has been top notch throughout their line, so was anxious to try these headphones. Upon unboxing, I have to say the first thing that impressed me was there was an actual manual, with words! Can't tell you how many times I've been befuddled opening a package and getting nothing but a QR code, or maybe a pamphlet with hieroglyphics.Two thumbs up to Anker. In another concession to clarity, the speakers themselves are imprinted with a L/R logo so you can quickly identify buttons & correct placement. A simple thing, but a nice touch. I next downloaded the Soundcore app, and powered on the headset, the bluetooth started blinking, and it popped up immediately on my phone. Without me touching a button, it then requested a firmware update, which installed with no issue. My immediate reaction to putting the headphones on was a comfortable feel; the sound level dropped immediately. Most comfortable pair of phones I've ever owned. Using the app, I set a limit on the sound level so I wouldn't get blasted as sometimes happens when you first power on a device or switch sources. Started going through my phones playlist, the sound was crisp, clean, and unmuddied. There are 3 modes, noise cancellation, transparent (allowing some awareness of surroundings) and NC off. I have to say, I was not impressed with the noise cancellation off setting, the sound wasn't as clear to me. Not an issue as you'd be defeating the purpose of the set, but maybe it's a setting or equalization I missed somewhere. Trying out the phone feature was very impressed with the clarity, probably due to the dual microphone this set is equipped with. Besides the type C charging cord, mini jack is included if you require a plug in experience, was impressed that the jacks were gold plated. Overall, this is a solid entry from Anker, at an affordable price."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] More and more noise cancelling headphones are becoming more popular, this translates into the different options and different prices that currently exist and these headphones are in a balance that is noticeable in every use, they have very good sound, excellent active noise cancellation, a nice design and a long battery life. One of the things I really like about these headphones is the comfort, I personally use headphones for long periods of time and having comfortable headphones is very important. The ear cushions are very comfortable and large enough to completely cover my ears, so when the noise cancellation is activated the experience is very satisfying. If we consider the price we can say that you get what you pay for, I mean that in a good way because this product fulfills its purpose very well, besides having an app that is very helpful. Within the app it is possible to activate and customize the active noise cancellation, you can customize the level from 1 to 5 and also has Adaptive Noise Cancelling which is the option I use and it works quite well. You can also select different sound effects as well as customize the EQ. If you select the Soundcore Signature preset with BassUp enabled you get very good results. The app is very simple but contains the essential customization options. Regarding sound quality I can say that it is pretty good, enjoying listening to music with noise cancellation and BassUp enabled is very comforting, it really makes you get immersed in whatever you are listening to. The microphone does its job but nothing outstanding. The headphones can be used wired, the 3.5mm cable is included. In summary I can say that these headphones are worth every penny, I have used premium headphones with ANC also and the truth is that these Soundcore Q45 could compete without a doubt, they have a very good autonomy and exceptional sound quality, they have their case to carry them everywhere and their charger cable with usb c connection. For its price and quality they are certainly a highly recommended active noise canceling headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Anker has some wonderful consumer tech. I have used their charging products like charging bricks and portable power banks, so this is my first time with one of their audio products from their Soundcore lineup. The Space Q 45s have blown my expectations away. Not only do these sound remarkable but the many features these headphones provide at this price point, make these a worthwhile choice if you are in search for some over-the-ear headphones. ========== IN THE BOX: In the box, one gets the Space Q 45’s, a hard-shell carrying case, a 3.5mm AUX cable, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. There is also a quick start guide included. ========== BUILD QUALITY AND COMFORT: Build quality seems fine. Most of the headphone is made from plastic but the headband is made from aluminum. The foam padding on the ear cups is thick and does feel comfortable. But the area that lacked comfort was the headband. There is some foam padding added to the headband, but I did not feel it was enough since after some time I did experience discomfort from the headband. These aren’t the most comfortable headphones I have used but if you aren’t using them for a prolonged period, one should be fine. ========== BATTERY: I was blown away by reading about how much battery these have. Anker states that the Q45s provide up to 50 hours of playtime in noise-cancelling mode. In normal mode, expect around up to 65 hours of playtime. I can attest to this by saying that these do indeed have a massive battery life. I have yet to charge these, and I have been using them for only a handful of hours the past couple of days. Also, if you are running low on battery with these Q45s, the Q45s do have the ability to charge quickly. A 5-minute charge will give you about 5 hours of playtime! ========== SOUND QUALITY AND ANC: The Q45s sound incredible. Out of the box, they sound good, but Anker offers some in-app features that allow for better sound quality. One of the features is an in-app custom EQ. Anker has some default EQ options for the genre of music you are listening to but there is a custom option if you need to fine-tune your desired sound. There is also the option to enable LDAC codec. This codec allows for high-resolution audio streaming over Bluetooth. This option only works with certain devices. In my case, I found it to work with my Galaxy S21 Ultra. I found that enabling this option with the custom EQ settings to be the optimal way to obtain the best sound out of these. The lows, mids, and highs were all clear and crisp to the ear. Overall, expect an immersive experience with these headphones. The downside to enabling the LDAC codec is that battery usage will be higher, and multipoint connection will no longer be available. The Q45s do have Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC). I don’t have any complaints about this feature. ANC seems to work great to the point I missed my doorbell ring while I was using these headphones! Noise reduction levels can be customized through the app too. There is a noticeable hiss when ANC is on but over time, I did get used to it. Transparency mode works just as well too. I was able to have a conversation with someone while the headphones were on without any problems. ========= FINAL THOUGHTS: Anker hit a homerun with the Space Q45s. Sound quality is top-notch, and the myriad of features is a surprise for headphones at this price range. Although I did find comfort wasn’t the best with these headphones (especially with the headband) I do think that Anker did an overall outstanding job at creating some budget-friendly over-the-ear headphones. I do wholeheartedly recommend you give these a try!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Top Notch Noise Cancelation close enough to Sony XM4 but half price, have great Sound and Features from APP, have other devices from SoundCore, never disappoints.']"

Before my husband retired, my home workplace was nice and quiet, but now the chance for ambient noise has increased dramatically. That is why I first invested in noise cancelling earbuds. The earbuds worked well, but I just wasn't crazy about how they felt in my ears or about how easy it was to misplace them. Then I tried full-fledged noise-cancelling USB earphones that plugged into my computer and had the microphone that angled in front of your mouth. They also worked well, but kept me tethered to the computer, unless I took them off of my head or unplugged them from the computer and dragged the cord around with me. Awkward! So, when I heard about the Anker Soundcore Q45 True Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-the-Ear Headphones, I couldn't wait to give them a try. I have several other Anker products and I have found them to be thoughtfully designed, easy to use and well functioning. I expected the same from the Space Q45's and I have not been disappointed. From the start, upon removing them from the box, I was impressed by the cleverly designed hard-walled case in which the headphones fit so neatly. Removing the headphones from the case, I was pleased by how soft, padded and pliable the contact areas of the Q45. A USB cable for charging the unit was provided with the Q45. It took about 2 hours for them to be totally charged. There is a Quick Start Guide provided in the box. Directly on the front of the Guide, it points you to the Soundcore Support website. It encourages you to download the Soundcore application to your phone. I am glad I did this, because under the Settings (Gear Icon), I found that there was an update to the device's firmware. I followed the directions and updated the firmware. Then explored the application a bit. There are multiple settings for the Q45 in the app and a listing of helpful Frequently Asked Questions. There is also a download for the full User's Manual. I placed the Q45's on my head, making sure to put the side marked R on the right side. They were so soft and comfortable. I found them to be easily adjusted to snuggly fit to my head. They felt much lighter than the USB wired headphones that I had used before. And, best thing yet, I could get up and move around without being tethered to the computer or removing them. Freedom! I paired up the Q45 via Bluetooth to the laptop that I was going to use for my upcoming class for work. This was a fast and easy feat. I found that the Q45 can be paired with multiple devices, so, I also paired them with my Android phone. I tested out the sound and three listening modes while playing my local NPR station on SimpleRadio. The sound was clear and vibrant. The Noise Canceling mode effectively eliminated the sound of landscaping crew mowing and blowing outside, as well as the cooling fans on my computers. I found pretty much the same result in the Normal mode - still very quiet ambient noise. The Transparency mode allowed me to hear the ambient sounds, but at a reduced, non-distractive level. The next day, I was readying myself for my class. I was a bit disconcerted that there was no microphone arm on the Q45. My fears that this would make the microphone ineffective was proven to be for nothing, as, later, when I was using the Q45's in my Zoom class, my trainers and classmates said that my sound was perfect. What a relief! I am very impressed with the Anker Soundcore Space Q45's. They are everything that I hoped for an untethered experience: great sound, comfortable and lightweight, long battery life and wire-free. A great experience all around!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am blown away by these Anker Soundcore Space Q45 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones. So far, these are the best noise-canceling headphones I have ever used. With up to 50 hours of playtime is crazy, they will outlast any flight or road trip. They claim up to 98% noise reduction, and I can attest that the noise cancellation capabilities are phenomenal with this set of headphones. What is also great is the transparency mode that lets you hear your surroundings. I like to use this mode when grocery shopping or when in a meeting at work or studying when my young kids are around, so I can keep tabs on what’s going on around me. The normal mode of ambient sound shuts off both the transparency mode and noise canceling mode, this saves battery but is also quiet. If I am in my house or wearing these headphones while in bed, normal mode is on. The functionality of the ambient noise features works great! I love that there is a way to toggle wind noise reduction as well. This pair of headphones 2 mics that make phone calls or meetings clear and enjoyable for the people you are talking to. The fit and feel of these Space Q45 Headphones are premium. The ear cups are very soft and plush with a soft memory foam feel that conforms to your head for a cozy yet secure fit. When pressed the memory foam cups have a 1 second reset time that is so satisfying. The pleather is ridiculously soft and feels great on the skin. The headband has great adjustability and is comfortable enough to wear for several hours. There are 9 clicks per side of the headband for precise adjustability. The same plush pleather on the ear cups can be found on the center of the headband facing down toward your head, and it is just as comfortable. There is a nice weight to this pair of headphones but only in a well-built way, as in they aren’t too heavy when you wear them for a while. The overall feel of these headphones is great. The setup was extremely easy and only took a minute. Just connect them to your device via Bluetooth or with the supplied 3.5mm headphone jack cable. I had zero issues connecting my phone, tablets, and computer to these headphones. The best way to get the full potential out of these headphones is to download the Soundcore app which is available on both the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. With the app, you can fine-tune the equalizer to your own custom setting or select one of the 21 preloaded Soundcore Signature equalizer settings. I personally listen to all types of music and found the Soundcore Signature with bass boost to be my favorite. There is so much you can do within the app such as change the ambient sound modes from noise canceling, normal, and transparency mode, set the audio level to the decibel you don’t want to go past, toggle the audio level according to your set limit, set what the ambient button on your headphones do, Equalizer settings, toggle reduce wind reduction, keep your firmware up to date, check out the Anker store, download sound quality software, and more. I recommend downloading the app to get the most out of this pair of headphones. I also recommend downloading the LDAC codec within the sound mode settings. LDAC is a proprietary audio coding technology developed by Sony, which allows streaming high-resolution audio over Bluetooth connections at up to 990 kbps at 24 bit/96 kHz, that’s 3x the data transmitted than normal, so you hear more in-depth sounds and with this pair of headphones, music sounds sooo good! The headphones themselves are very simple to use. There are 4 buttons on the headphones, power, noise canceling, play/pause, and volume up/down. There is also a USB Type-C for charging and a 3.5mm jack port. The look and esthetics are great, I love the big cups, but they aren’t too big. The smooth round edges are modern and sleek and don’t cause a scene but rather a statement, subtly. What comes in the box? The box comes with a pair of headphones, a USB type-A to USB Type-C for charging, a 3.5mm jack cable, a quick start guide, and warranty paperwork, as well as a protective carry case which I thought was really cool that they added that. I love having the option to protect the headphones with a hard zippered case over a soft bag any day, Anker did a great job by adding the hard protective case. Overall, I am in love with these headphones. The sound is incredible. The noise canceling is incredible. The price for what you get is incredible. I recommend these to everyone from students to parents, to the elderly. If you are looking for premium sound in an easy-on-the-eyes pair of headphones, look no further. By far, the pair of headphones I have ever had. I am blown away by these premium headphones from fit to finish to sound quality, I think Anker knocked it out of the park with these.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Do not be mistaken, these headphones are the most impressive in the lineup, behind the AirPods Max in my opinion. They are better than the Sony XM4! They have amazing sound, of course, but here's the thing, only the AirPods Max and Anker Q45 have brilliantly clear transparency modes, which matter a lot to me. But guess what.. here's a shocker... The Anker Q45s are more comfortable than the AirPods Max! My only issue with them are the fact that they do not turn off the videos or music you are listening to when you remove the headphones, but it's not that big of a deal. They also seamlessly switch between devices when audio starts playing on different ones they are paired with, which is another huge win for these. As for me, I bought a set of AirPods Max for the transparancy mode as they are slightly better, but I am surprised at how much I like the Anker Q45. For $99.99, I find them worth keeping around as a second pair. Keep in mind, the AirPods are 5.5x more expensive. If you want the best headphones for a fraction of the cost of the AirPods, it's no contest, this is it. Forgot to mention, I also bought the Sony XM4s on sale but I am returning those. Final note, the travel case these come in are okay, but not better than Sony one."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I currently own a number of Anker devices, from phone chargers to USB ports, power banks, & bluetooth speakers. The quality has been top notch throughout their line, so was anxious to try these headphones. Upon unboxing, I have to say the first thing that impressed me was there was an actual manual, with words! Can't tell you how many times I've been befuddled opening a package and getting nothing but a QR code, or maybe a pamphlet with hieroglyphics.Two thumbs up to Anker. In another concession to clarity, the speakers themselves are imprinted with a L/R logo so you can quickly identify buttons & correct placement. A simple thing, but a nice touch. I next downloaded the Soundcore app, and powered on the headset, the bluetooth started blinking, and it popped up immediately on my phone. Without me touching a button, it then requested a firmware update, which installed with no issue. My immediate reaction to putting the headphones on was a comfortable feel; the sound level dropped immediately. Most comfortable pair of phones I've ever owned. Using the app, I set a limit on the sound level so I wouldn't get blasted as sometimes happens when you first power on a device or switch sources. Started going through my phones playlist, the sound was crisp, clean, and unmuddied. There are 3 modes, noise cancellation, transparent (allowing some awareness of surroundings) and NC off. I have to say, I was not impressed with the noise cancellation off setting, the sound wasn't as clear to me. Not an issue as you'd be defeating the purpose of the set, but maybe it's a setting or equalization I missed somewhere. Trying out the phone feature was very impressed with the clarity, probably due to the dual microphone this set is equipped with. Besides the type C charging cord, mini jack is included if you require a plug in experience, was impressed that the jacks were gold plated. Overall, this is a solid entry from Anker, at an affordable price."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] More and more noise cancelling headphones are becoming more popular, this translates into the different options and different prices that currently exist and these headphones are in a balance that is noticeable in every use, they have very good sound, excellent active noise cancellation, a nice design and a long battery life. One of the things I really like about these headphones is the comfort, I personally use headphones for long periods of time and having comfortable headphones is very important. The ear cushions are very comfortable and large enough to completely cover my ears, so when the noise cancellation is activated the experience is very satisfying. If we consider the price we can say that you get what you pay for, I mean that in a good way because this product fulfills its purpose very well, besides having an app that is very helpful. Within the app it is possible to activate and customize the active noise cancellation, you can customize the level from 1 to 5 and also has Adaptive Noise Cancelling which is the option I use and it works quite well. You can also select different sound effects as well as customize the EQ. If you select the Soundcore Signature preset with BassUp enabled you get very good results. The app is very simple but contains the essential customization options. Regarding sound quality I can say that it is pretty good, enjoying listening to music with noise cancellation and BassUp enabled is very comforting, it really makes you get immersed in whatever you are listening to. The microphone does its job but nothing outstanding. The headphones can be used wired, the 3.5mm cable is included. In summary I can say that these headphones are worth every penny, I have used premium headphones with ANC also and the truth is that these Soundcore Q45 could compete without a doubt, they have a very good autonomy and exceptional sound quality, they have their case to carry them everywhere and their charger cable with usb c connection. For its price and quality they are certainly a highly recommended active noise canceling headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Anker has some wonderful consumer tech. I have used their charging products like charging bricks and portable power banks, so this is my first time with one of their audio products from their Soundcore lineup. The Space Q 45s have blown my expectations away. Not only do these sound remarkable but the many features these headphones provide at this price point, make these a worthwhile choice if you are in search for some over-the-ear headphones. ========== IN THE BOX: In the box, one gets the Space Q 45’s, a hard-shell carrying case, a 3.5mm AUX cable, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. There is also a quick start guide included. ========== BUILD QUALITY AND COMFORT: Build quality seems fine. Most of the headphone is made from plastic but the headband is made from aluminum. The foam padding on the ear cups is thick and does feel comfortable. But the area that lacked comfort was the headband. There is some foam padding added to the headband, but I did not feel it was enough since after some time I did experience discomfort from the headband. These aren’t the most comfortable headphones I have used but if you aren’t using them for a prolonged period, one should be fine. ========== BATTERY: I was blown away by reading about how much battery these have. Anker states that the Q45s provide up to 50 hours of playtime in noise-cancelling mode. In normal mode, expect around up to 65 hours of playtime. I can attest to this by saying that these do indeed have a massive battery life. I have yet to charge these, and I have been using them for only a handful of hours the past couple of days. Also, if you are running low on battery with these Q45s, the Q45s do have the ability to charge quickly. A 5-minute charge will give you about 5 hours of playtime! ========== SOUND QUALITY AND ANC: The Q45s sound incredible. Out of the box, they sound good, but Anker offers some in-app features that allow for better sound quality. One of the features is an in-app custom EQ. Anker has some default EQ options for the genre of music you are listening to but there is a custom option if you need to fine-tune your desired sound. There is also the option to enable LDAC codec. This codec allows for high-resolution audio streaming over Bluetooth. This option only works with certain devices. In my case, I found it to work with my Galaxy S21 Ultra. I found that enabling this option with the custom EQ settings to be the optimal way to obtain the best sound out of these. The lows, mids, and highs were all clear and crisp to the ear. Overall, expect an immersive experience with these headphones. The downside to enabling the LDAC codec is that battery usage will be higher, and multipoint connection will no longer be available. The Q45s do have Adaptive Noise Cancelling (ANC). I don’t have any complaints about this feature. ANC seems to work great to the point I missed my doorbell ring while I was using these headphones! Noise reduction levels can be customized through the app too. There is a noticeable hiss when ANC is on but over time, I did get used to it. Transparency mode works just as well too. I was able to have a conversation with someone while the headphones were on without any problems. ========= FINAL THOUGHTS: Anker hit a homerun with the Space Q45s. Sound quality is top-notch, and the myriad of features is a surprise for headphones at this price range. Although I did find comfort wasn’t the best with these headphones (especially with the headband) I do think that Anker did an overall outstanding job at creating some budget-friendly over-the-ear headphones. I do wholeheartedly recommend you give these a try!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Top Notch Noise Cancelation close enough to Sony XM4 but half price, have great Sound and Features from APP, have other devices from SoundCore, never disappoints.']"
Turtle Beach Stealth 600X Gen 3 Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox Series X|S - Black,$109.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-600x-gen-3-wireless-gaming-headset-for-xbox-series-xs-black/17919853/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Turtle Beach upped their game with this headset. For the price, it has a nice, simplified design that feels more current and premium than their prior models that I’ve owned. It’s also a lot more straightforward - I much prefer the built in flip down mic that is streamlined into the design in this model. Sound is great for the price. It’s an all-around great headset. __Design__ Looking at design a bit more, it’s clear that Turtle Beach wanted to offer a more modernized design in this headset. The plastic cups and band feel durable and appropriate, while the cushions are well thought out. Memory foam makes them comfortable and soft, but the fabric on the ear cups are also pleasantly soft (despite looking like a rougher weave in photos) They retain a bit of head in the ear cups while wearing, but I found them plenty comfortable for extended use. I also appreciate the easy to clean, soft covering on the head band's cushion. If you’ve owned a headset and use hair gel or anything, you’ll know the importance of easy clean-ability here and this headset doesn’t disappoint. :) Also nice are the big chunky wheels for control volume and chat levels. Their easy to feel for and have a satisfying feel. _Sound_ Sound quality is quite good for the price. At first it felt slightly airy, but after a firmware update (via the app) and a set back to their suggested ‘Signature Sound’ default, sound was great. Playing on Xbox Series X, it’s responsive, balanced, and easy to plug and play. _App_ I found Turtle Beach’s Swarm II app is modern and responsive. Updating my headset’s firmware was super simple and it allows for easy selection of game presets and ‘Superhuman Hearing’ to emphasize sounds that could help you hear coming enemies in games more easily. Overall, this is a great headset. In a market with so many offerings, Turtle Beach really nailed it this time. Really good value for the price."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset just upped my gaming to the next level. I tried them on the Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and iPhone and was pleased with the ease of connection across all platforms. Additionally, I found that they are truly designed with gaming in mind. First off, set up is so easy. To connect it to the Xbox or PC, all I have to do is toggle between the Xbox or USB option on the wireless transmitter and plug it in. With the PC, I had to go to my sound settings and select that it uses the Stealth headset. Bluetooth setup is just as easy. With the phone and Nintendo Switch, I just switched the headset to Bluetooth mode and activated pairing mode. It connected in seconds, and I was good to go. It is ideal to get the Swarm II app because it provides the option to update the headset to the latest available firmware. It also provides customization features and provides battery level information. The build and materials are of high quality. It is sturdy and the buttons and dials are well-placed. It is incredibly comfortable considering its weight. I actually forget I am wearing it. To top it off, they provide really good noise cancelation. The headphones can be turned around individually, which helps keep them flat against my clavicle when I take them off and have them around my neck. The sound is the best part. It is akin to having surround sound and it allows for spatial awareness. Playing Battlefield, I was able to hear footsteps clear and crisply, along with the direction they were coming from. The lower bass sounds of explosions and of the dramatic music intensify the gaming experience. I did try it with music on my phone too, and under the right preset the sound is amazing. It even provides a better experience with my Nintendo Switch. I hear sounds and music that I had not heard before, even when using my regular headphones. With all this in mind, I can tell that Turtle Beach really focused on elevating the sounds that are prevalent in gaming beyond all other types. The drop-down mic is another great addition. The mic will mute and unmute according to its position and the way it tucks in is quite low profile it almost seems to disappear. It does not take in too much ambient noises, my mouse and typing clicks are quite muted. One thing I noticed initially is the my voice came out sounding very low and far away. I was able to fix this using the mic settings on the app though. I believe these headsets are well worth the price. They provide great sound, are well-made, comfortable, and they are designed with gaming in mind.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The expansion of gaming is an undeniable reality, as well as the number of products available for this purpose. One of the most required gaming accessories besides controllers, keyboards and mice, are headphones. I have had the fortune to try different types of gaming headsets, some very good, others not so good, different brands and among them Turtle Beach, which I must admit that over time have improved their product line. I have tried other generations of the Stealth series and this time it has met my expectations, although it is not a perfect product, it does well. In the box you get the headphones, a USB wireless transmitter, a charging cable USB-A to USB-C and a quick start guide. There are two ways to connect the headphones to the different compatible devices. First, you can connect via bluetooth through your phone's bluetooth settings, you can also install an app to access different settings of the headphones, although without installing the app the headphones work without any problem. The other way is with the usb wireless transmitter, this can be connected to consoles and pc. It is important to read the quick start guide as it contains instructions on how to connect the headphones to these different types of devices. The headphones have a set of buttons on the bottom of the left earphone. Power button, bluetooth, “mode button” (used to change the eq preset) and one more to change the connection type. This last one seems great to me because just by pressing a button you can switch from bluetooth to wireless and vice versa, when I finish playing on pc and proceed to do another activity, I just press the button to change the connection and then the headphones connect to my phone (previously paired in bluetooth settings), I find it very convenient. It also has two wheels one is for the master audio volume and one for game/chat mix. The design looks good, although I think they are a little big for my taste. However, one thing that is undeniable is comfort, so the design serves this purpose and I am happy with it. The pads are soft and do not irritate the skin, in my case I have not had any problem in this regard. The adjustable headband is comfortable as well. That the microphone is retractable is already a Turtle Beach signature, I like it. In performance this device is on par with other mid-range gaming headsets, which makes it, in my opinion, a balanced product in its cost/benefit ratio. The sound is very good, although it could be better. The size of the drivers allows you to feel a deeper sound quality. Despite not being headphones with active noise cancellation, it does isolate the outside sound to a good extent. The equalizer presets are fine, although for me only two of them convinced me more, as there are times when the increase of certain frequencies in a couple of presets makes the mids and sometimes the highs are distorted a little, nothing serious but I prefer the Signature Sound preset. In different games the sound delivered by the headphones is quite good, I can play without any inconvenience and get the same results as with my wired headphones. The microphone is loud and clear, it can also be configured from the Swarm II app and this gives it a plus. One thing that makes these gaming headsets stand out to me the most is the battery. I have been using the headphones for days and the battery continues to hold enough charge to keep using them for gaming and playing content on my other devices. This is one of their strongest points and what makes me conclude that, without a doubt, these are headphones that are worth the price and if they had at some point a discount, even better. If you are looking for a good pair of gaming headphones that you can use with your console, pc, phone, tablet, at a reasonable price, I can definitely recommend these Turtle Beach Stealth 600 headphones."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones were amazing to say at the least. They fit so comfortably on my head and the sound quality was nothing short of perfect. I had no issues with connectivity or the battery life. The battery life lasts long which is a huge plus!!! Super easy to connect and I look forward to continue using these!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First off these things are absolutely made for more than just gaming! These are crystal clear right out of the box. They had a nice Sturdy frame and a nice balance to them, and the flippable microphone is very ""stealthy."" Overall these are absolutely one of my favorites for gaming now, the portability and battery life is incredible. 80 hours of battery life. They have a jersey like material for the ear cups. And these have some serious cushioning, like a lot! Lol but it\'s a good thing. These have built in A .I. Mic noise reduction and phone calls actually sound great in these! 2.5 Ghz wireless Bluetooth and the super low latency dongle which always came in handy for shooters and group chats. They had the ability to lay completely flat on display and on my neck. These are completely compatible with PC / PlayStation / Xbox / Switch and Mobile. Also you can configure the Equalizer to spec in the Swarm II desktop and mobile app. Overall I would totally give these five out of five for overall quality and reliability. These can easily be everyday headphones if u want them to be! Such an upgrade to being an all around essential pair of do-it-all headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been testing this headset for a week now whilst playing through Monster Hunter World for the first time (VERY fun game btw!) and it left me with a very positive impression. Firstly, I expected good things as I have owned previous Turtle Beach headsets in the past and they have held up very well with daily use, the Stealth 600 headset is no different. The headset itself has a nice and sleek look without any garish RGB elements, this feels like a headset for an adult with a really clean and sleek desk space that might lean more towards a wooden or black desk setup without a lot of the typical ""gamer"" lighting and a more refined style such as a home office/gaming area. The microphone can be pushed up and out of the way completely if you don\'t intend to use comms much and just want the game audio or even for listening to music. I downloaded the accompanying app because a big thing for me is having good mic monitoring so I don\'t stumble over my words and I\'m happy to say that with the app I turned mic monitoring up to max and it was decent enough that I could wear my headset and speak without getting confused. The app also allows you to tweak various other settings too which I did to enhance my audio experience. The audio quality is great, definitely no complaints on my end, and as previously mentioned things can be tweaked to your exact liking in the app. Having a wireless headset also takes away the frustration of getting tangled in cables or if I have to get up to do something I can just keep it on. I partied up with my husband and he felt that the microphone was good too and I came across clearly, not as clear as a dynamic or condenser microphone, the one I use is a Hyper X quad cast but for a built in headset mic it held its own and was definitely good enough! One last thing I\'ll add is that the headset was so comfortable! And as a girl I sometimes struggle to find headsets that fit but this is so adjustable I was able to headbang (for testing purposes haha) and the headset remained secure on my head, it didn\'t slip at all. Overall a 4.5/5 for me, not my favorite design but for the right person it looks sleek and refined and most importantly the audio quality is fantastic. I will absolutely continue to use this for Xbox gaming and it was a real treat to receive this product and get to enjoy it, thanks!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was needing a good headset for my Xbox One X. I was looking forward to Turtle Beach's Stealth 600 covering that need. I play role playing games as well as first person shooters, so I needed something that would provide immersive audio for the role playing games and something that would allow me to take part in team chat in the first person shooters. The Stealth 600 more than covered that need. Construction The headset is of good construction. The headband padding is soft and comfortable. The padding for the ear pieces are also made of thick padding and are comfortable to wear for hours of gaming. The weight of the headset I found to be reasonable and the weight didn't cause me to feel fatigued after many hours of gaming. Each earpiece can swivel left or right and can be extended to accommodate anyone. The mic is easy to access to move down when I need to use it and move it up when I don't. When in the up position, it fits in a recessed part of the headset, so it ends up being out of my way and is seamless with the headset, so I don't accidentally move it if I touch the headset during gameplay. Controls and Buttons The controls and mic are on the left side of the headset. There are two dials, one for global volume and one that allows me to adjust the volume mixture of game audio and chat audio. Each dial had it's own texture which made it easy for me to identify each by touch while wearing the headset. There are also 4 buttons. One powers on the headset and also has a light which indicates charge status when charging and it also indicates whether or not it is in standard wireless mode or Bluetooth mode. It comes with a USB-A dongle that is plugged into the XBox. If I am going to use the headset with a PC, then I can connect it via Bluetooth or flip a switch on the dongle to use standard wireless. I prefer to keep the dongle in the Xbox for use with standard wireless and just switch to Bluetooth for use with my PC. There is also a button on the headset for switching from Bluetooth to standard wireless. There is another button on the headset for switching between EQ modes. The EQ and mic can be setup through the Swarm app. And lastly, There is a USB-C charge port on the left earpiece. Charging doesn't take too long and the charge last a while. Audio Quality The quality of audio from the Stealth 600 is incredible. I had been playing Diablo IV with the audio coming through my TV speakers prior to getting the Stealth 600. Role playing game developers put a lot of time, money, and effort into their sound tracks, so if you aren't hearing the audio from a good set of speakers, you are missing out. I immediately noticed a tremendous difference with the Stealth 600. The level of immersion was top level. So much that I don't want to play the game without the headset going forward. I have to hand it to Turtle Beach on the quality of audio from the headset. Final Thoughts I really like the design of the Stealth 600. It would have been nice to see a headset stand included with it, but that isn't that big of a deal to me. At first I didn't like the idea of having to use a dongle on my Xbox, but I realized that it being plugged into the USB port on the back it was out of the way and out of sight so I didn't really think about it as it was out of site out of mind. The level of immersive audio I get from the Stealth 600 is top notch. I can't say enough about that. Overall, I very happy with the headset and, at this price point, I think a lot of gamers will be happy with them."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I needed a wireless headset that would work with both an Xbox and PC. I’ve used Turtle Beach headphones years ago during the xbox 360 years, so I picked up the Turtle Beach Stealth 600. The added connectivity to other devices and long battery life made it stand out. Pros: - Compatibility with different devices and platforms. - 80 Hour Battery Life. - Lightweight. - Ear Cushion fabic. Cons: - Included instructions missing some steps. - Sound quality is only okay. Setup: Even though I picked this up to use with the Xbox and PC, I tried out the phone pairing method. Sad to say, it took me a few mins to realize you had to switch the headphones into Bluetooth mode to pair them. The included instructions did not outline that the headphones needed to switch modes before you could pair using bluetooth. So, if you are wondering why, you cannot find the headphones from a Bluetooth device, try switching the mode to when you hear a “BlueTooth” audio que. This was mostly my fault, as I was pressing buttons when I turned the headset on and when putting them on for the first time. Otherwise, once I had the right mode, connecting was simple. You will need to download the Swarm II app on your phone or install it on your PC/console. For mobile devices, open the app, power on the headphones, and add the device. Then you can access settings such as additional features, mentioned below. If on a PC or Console, make sure the dongle is set to the right mode: USB for PC or XBOX/PS for Console. Plug in the dongle, open the App, and turn on the Stealth 600’s. Then it is about the same regardless of platform. The compatibility of this headset is a huge pro, especially for those with multiple systems or devices. The Swarm II app is available on all platforms, I found the PC version to be the easiest to navigate and connect too. The App provides additional settings to control the volumes, chat mix as there is a game and chat channel, and controls for the Microphone sensitivity and monitoring. The EQ Controls allow you to select pre-sets or make custom EQs, and switch between them on the fly by pressing the “Mode” button. Then you can customize the mapped button functions for the “Mode” and “Chat Mix” scroll wheel. There are also settings for SuperHuman hearing, a signature Turtle Beach mode that helps focus in on specific sounds while gaming like footsteps or shots. Comfort: At only 0.7 lbs, the Stealth 600 Gen 3 are lightweight, and fit well on the head. The headband provides the clamping force for the headset, which wasn’t too much for me and kept them in place on my head, but for those with bigger heads I could see the pressure to be uncomfortable after a while. Luckily, Turtle Beach opted for using an athletic weave fabric for the ear cushions which a breathable and comfortable against the ear over long periods of use. Controls: All buttons are located on the Left earcup, along with the Microphone boom. The flip up to Mute feature is extremely useful on a gaming headset, I’ve had it on many of my work microphones, but this is one of my first gaming headsets with it. From the button up of the earcup is the Power, Mode, USB-C Port, Bluetooth, Quickswitch buttons. The Bluetooth button is a multifunction button used when connected to mobile devices to answer/end calls and control media playback. There are two scroll wheels on the back of the earcup, the bottom one controls the Channel Mix for console or Mic Monitoring for PC, or custom function you select. The top wheel controls the Master Volume. Each wheel has a different tactile feel to make it easy to distinguish between, BUT I still dislike the default functions of the two wheels. I wish I could swap the functions, because I use the Channel mix less than master volume, but my thumb lands on the channel mix every time. It would be nice to be able to customize more than 2 buttons and with other default functions. Performance: The 80-hour battery life is truly massive. I’ve not put in enough hours thus far to fully drain the battery, I’ve only charged it once so far and gotten in at least 40 hours of use over the long weekend and the battery status is at 54%! No need to worry about running out of power in the middle of a long gaming session. The Audio quality is unfortunately only average, even adjusting the EQ settings only helps so much. The sound is clear and crisp, great for hearing all the noises during a firefight or boss battle, but there is no depth or richness to the sound. This is okay for playing video games, but you will notice during the cutscenes or with music, there is just something missing. I got this headset for the ability to play and chat, which it does good with what it has. The Microphone quality is also good, but not great. The settings allow you to tweak the sensitivity and noise gate, and the monitoring allows you to hear yourself to help balance the sound while speaking. But the Microphone sounds tinny on the other end of the calls, this is fine for game chat as the microphone is clear, but for recording or streaming this will stand out in a bad way. The EQ does help bring out your voice more, but the tinny sound is still present. Conclusion: I’m really enjoying the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3’s, the long battery life keeps them ready to go, the multiplatform compatibility allows for use across all the devices, and they’re comfortable to keep on the head for long periods of time. They’re doing everything I wanted them to, without me disliking anything enough to stop using them. That’s worth a recommendation from me. I’d recommend these to anyone who has multiple gaming platforms and who likes to play and chat over concerns for audio quality. These have a good balance of features, quality, and performance for the price point, that makes them a solid option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The way these adjust easily while doing so is magnificent! I love how it’s noise cancellation. The battery life does own up to what the brand says it lasts! These were so easy to set up, and to start using them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just perfect for XBOX fans! I note that their sound is just a bomb! They will last forever! very comfortable! Easy to connect in 1 minute! The battery lasts more than 24 hours!']"

Soundcore by Anker Space One Over-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - White,$99.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/soundcore-by-anker-space-one-over-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-white/17186892/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The two main things that drew me to this headset is that I find them to be very attractive and have been a fan of Soundcore in the past. The price for what you get here is insane. As you normally don’t get all the features at this price point. But with that said the features themselves do not perform at the same level as more expensive headphones. But are a solid pick for those looking for budget headphones as these may be hard to beat when you look wholistically at them. COMFORT: It is almost entirely made of plastic. It feels solid, but lightweight. Also, I didn’t notice any creaking. But not sure who these would fair with a big drop or aggressive use. It has plastic notches for the headband itself which can fit small to large heads. They feel good and it stays in place well. The earcups themselves move slightly anteriorly (forward) but fully posteriorly (backward). They also tilt just a bit. Clamping force is very light. To the point that if I shake my head they come off. Which makes them a bit frustrating when working out. As if you have a lot of movement or are lying down they will require adjustment to stay on. The foam of the earpads is solid. It’s not top of the line but not bad either. Quite soft and plushy but not amazing. In general I find them to be comfortable. I can wear them for long periods without issues. But aren’t the most comfortable things I’ve tried either. I’d probably give them a 7/10. SOUND: It is good, I’d say a 6/10 when compared to headphones that are much more expensive than them and an 8/10 for others in the same price range. It isn’t groundbreaking or something that will blow your socks off. You won’t be hearing anything new that you haven’t heard before. As these are budget headphones and I don’t want to give you unrealistic expectations. With that said for the price I think they sound great. You can easily differentiate different sounds in songs. Vocals sound clear. But it lacks sparkle that the more expensive guys will give you that will rock your soul. Which again, I wouldn’t expect at this price range. Bass is light, but present. Mids are bit recessed and muddy. Highs are slightly sharp but clear. Sounds are mostly accurate but do sound very mildly processed. I’m happy to sit and listen to music while working or working out. Also use them to watch shows/media (TikTok, YouTube, etc.). With that I do notice slight latency if I’m being hyper critical with talking videos. But if I want critical listening, I reach for something else. FEATURES: For the price I am shocked at how many features this thing packs. Some of these features require you to go into the SoundCore App to enable. Such as wear detection. Which works relatively well. It is mildly delayed where it takes about a second to play/pause the media both when taking it off and putting it back on. It comes with noise cancelling. It is meh performance wise. Where it slightly mutes or reduces lower end sounds while changing the pitch of medium or higher pitched sounds making them less noticeable. Over actually cancelling them like more expensive headphones. I’d rate the overall ANC as a 5/10. The seal of the headphone itself isn’t significant but does most of the work (passive noise cancelling). The transparency mode is solid. I found it lets in a good amount of noise allowing me to hear what is going on around me and allows me to have a conversation without too much trouble. But isn’t to the level of Apples transparency. When you first power on the headset it will say connected along with the battery level which I like. It will also announce when it is in pairing mode and when the battery is low. I found the alerts themselves were the right volume of not being deafening nor too quiet where you can’t hear what it is saying. The App itself is great. It adds a lot of features and is worth checking out. One interesting point is the “heardID” which should give you better sound based on your personal hearing. This didn’t work well for me. You also have access to a custom EQ (8 band 100, 200, 400, 800, 1.6k, 3.2k, 6.4k, and 12.8k). You can have multiple custom EQ’s saved. There are multiple preset sounds you can select. I chose “Soundcore Signature” as I figure that is what most people will leave it on as that is the default mode. Quick spewing of a bunch of other features in a single paragraph. “Easy chat” (turn on in app first) that enables transparency mode if you hold left side of earcup. Works well. Also, has a speak to enable. Which does the same thing and will enable when it thinks it hears a voice. Which turns off after stop speaking for 5 seconds or pressing NC button. I like that you can cancel this manually. “Safe volume” will limit how loud the headphones can get. But found that it isn’t necessary on these as they don’t get very loud (on my iPhone 14 Pro Max) as the max I got was about 78 dB at full volume. I did find if I had this enabled that it would make everything quieter way before it got close to the limit I had placed so left it off. Dual connections. Auto power off (30, 60, 90, 120, never). Voice prompt for battery and ambient sound. For the price the features are actually insane. There is also a 3.5 mm jack (which is included) for wired listening and it does not need to be powered on for that. USB-C for charging. Great battery life. CONTROLS: On the left earcup on the bottom you have your power on/off. If you long press that when powering on it will go into pairing mode. Just above that is the noise cancelling, transparency, or normal mode. I like that it actually says the mode over giving you a vague tone. If you double tap the top button it goes between normal mode and bass boost. Unfortunately, this double tap doesn’t work all the time and is finicky with timing. On the right earcup you have your play/pause. Which is finicky and doesn’t always work on first try and there is a bit of a delay. Skip forward/backward is not supported. Or at least that I could figure out as multiple presses to the button does nothing. Just above that you have your volume up and down button. All buttons feel the same without variance, with a satisfying bump when clicked and a quiet click. You do get mild microphonics in the earcup when messing with them. CONCLUSION: At first glance and when operating normally these things perform excellently for their price. And I think if you gave them to others and had them try them out, they would think they are more expensive than they are. But once you start nitpicking and comparing them to more expensive headphones you understand why there is a price difference. But for most people who aren’t wanting the best and just want a solid pair of headphones these will be a great pick that will do nearly everything you want well without breaking the bank.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I gave these five stars because of the price, features, and sound quality. I have lots of over the ear headphones ranging from $30 to $400. Even those these are on the cheaper they have a lot of features and sound very good. These will not replace my $400 headphones, but these will be used for travel and other places I don’t want to take expensive headphones. When I first got these and hooked them up to my tablet I was a little disappointed with sound and bass. Then I realized I needed to download their application to fine tune/setup the headphones. Once I downloaded the app, the headphones received an update that drastically changed the sound of the headphones for the better. The app is very easy to use and allows you to customize some of the buttons on the headphones, change the equalizer, and learn more about the device. I like that the equalizer allows you to customize your own, pick from multiple preset ones, or use the app to create a perfect equalizer for your ears. The headphones themselves are not flashy (which I love) and the controls are easy to use. On the headphones you have power, volume up/down also controls skip forward or back, play pause also can be used for answer and hangup phone call, and noise canceling (cycles through the three modes). If you place your hand over the left speaker it mutes the music and turns off noise canceling to allow you to hear the environment around you. Once you take your hand off the music plays and the noise canceling turns back on. These headphones also have a feature that if you take off the headphones it will pause whatever is playing. I had a little trouble with this feature as it worked sometimes but not always. The sound on these headphones is full and rich. I listen to all different types of music and these headphones play everything with ease. The noise canceling does a great job as I couldn’t hear anything penetrating in from noisy environment I tested them in. Even if you do not have anything playing the noise canceling works pretty well if you just need a quiet moment. I also like the fact that these headphones use Bluetooth or can use an AUX cable as well. It’s nice to have that choice if your device has a headphone output. Battery life has been stellar as well, I used them for about 8 hours watching tv at a moderate level and only used 10% of the battery. So these will last a long time on a single charge. They are also very comfortable to wear and did not cause my ears to get hot like other ones have. Overall these are a solid buy considering the functions and sound quality at the price point. The headphones also came with a carrying bag, charging cable, and an aux cable. The carrying bag is nothing fancy but nice to be able to keep cables and headphones all in one place.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just so people are aware, Soundcore is Anker\'s line of audio products. Anker came into the scene seemingly out of nowhere as a prominent figure in the electronics and accessories market over the past few years. I\'d put them on par with more established companies like Belkin and Mophie at this point. I\'ve been purchasing their gallium nitride (GaN) technology power bricks and cables for ages now and have been fairly happy with my purchases. This is actually my first Soundcore product and I\'m honestly surprised at how well it does compared to my other active noise cancelling (ANC) over-ears. I quite literally own all the mainstream ANC headsets by Sony, Bose, and Apple and TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE PRICE, this is a great option. Sound quality could be better - particularly with the richness of the sound itself and the overall soundstage/fullness of the sound itself. However, you can make it sound better when you tweak the settings through the Soundcore app. The app also lets you play around with the noise cancelling, which was surprisingly good and honestly on par with much more expensive options. I would say this would be a GREAT gift for high school/college-level students and even for those who just want something affordable with ANC. I tried them on a 3-hour domestic flight and it did a phenomenal job of drowning out the standard cabin noises, including a crying toddler! I never got to test out the full capacity of the battery but this thing is rated for 40 hours with the ANC on and 55 hours with the ANC turned off, which is entirely very impressive. I wouldn\'t recommend these for those who want to use these primarily for phone and conference calls as the microphone isn\'t particularly great. I don\'t know if it\'s the noise reducing microphones or what but the people I spoke with mentioned that I didn\'t sound all that clear, if anything a little ""distant"" from the mic itself. Overall, though, a great budget option for people seeking a reasonably-priced, ANC-compatible b/t headset.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are not the first Soundcore or Anker product I have owned. I have a set of Soundcore earbuds and a few of their charging cables. Like Anker’s other products, these headphones are a reasonable price and an excellent value for the performance they offer. Pros 1. Solid build quality and comfortable to wear. The hinges that allow them to fold for storage are tight and there is no squeaky plastic sound when adjusting them or wearing them. Plastics are nicely textured with a subtle design. I am bald and the headband is nicely cushioned for wearing for longer periods. My wife and daughter have braids and they said they fit well with no pulling from hair getting caught in hinges and plenty of adjustment. 2. Active noise cancelling (ANC) is effective and has a lot of adjustments to fit your use – allowing you to pick different levels, use an adaptive setting that adjust with background noise, and a few options to allow audio pass through for conversations or awareness (like walking on a street). With full noise cancelling on at moderate volume – all background noise and most conversations are blocked out (I have actually missed people talking to me completely with the volume up). 3. Physical buttons for volume, noise cancelling mode changes, play/pause, and power/pairing which are far more reliable than touch controls that some headphones have. 4. Good sound quality with high quality audio over Bluetooth (LDAC) support and a lot of audio adjustments via the Soundcore app. The app offers an audio test to help you set your equalizer settings – which is cool, but I still had to make some tweaks to the equalizer to get the bass where I wanted – overall volume and clarity are good. 5. Excellent battery life. I have not had to recharge them yet, but in the 5 days I have owned them, I am averaging around 2% per hour of listening with LDAC and noise cancelling enabled (this is in line or a little better than the 40 hours provided by Anker in the specs with these features enabled – it is 55 hours LDAC and ANC off). 6. Wired operation (with an included 4ft headphone cable) is available for devices that don’t support Bluetooth and you can even use it as a headset for calls via the wire. 7. Works well as a headset and even has a wind noise reduction option via the Soundcore app. I didn’t test this in a windy place, but phone calls I took while wearing them around the house were clear on my end and people on the other end said I sounded as good or better than when using my cellphone. 8. Wearing detection works great to pause playback if you take the headphones off (once you configure it in the app). Things to Consider 1. The Soundcore app is excellent, but also required to get the most out of these headphones. Default audio settings are just adequate, and these really work better with the equalizer available in the app. You also have to use the app to enable hi-res audio and wearing detection. Just make sure to disable any default equalizers in your phone audio settings to avoid conflicts with the app's equalizer (I was getting some weird reverb from having my Motorola’s default Dolby audio enhancements on with the Soundcore equalizer)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression was that these matte black headphones are slick and have a sophisticated flair to them. Although they are mostly plastic, they seem well-built, and I hope they last. I was very pleased that there wasn't any creaking. The headphones have ample flexibility, and the cups are decently adjustable. Now, they are very well padded and super soft –both on the cups and the headband. Although there is light clamping force, they still stay on during walks and normal head movement. They are quite light, so I experienced almost no fatigue during long sessions. They do get a bit hot though. I also tried them with a hat and glasses with no issues. The Space Ones feature Bluetooth 5.3 so pairing them was easy. I did not notice any real issues at normal distances and encountered little to no lag or sync issues. There is an option for multiple point connection, but that would disable the LDAC capability. The ANC/ambient sound modes worked great. Although I could still hear higher pitch sounds, it made listening in crowded and traffic settings a good experience. The ambient mode made things sound a bit unnatural, but it is welcomed when awareness is needed. I love that these headphones can be muted with ambient mode by cupping the left cup. Also, while I found it a bit inconsistent, there is a speak-to-mute option as well. To top it off, the cups have auto-pause/play when taking the headset off or putting it on. The call quality is good. It is still very obvious that I was on Bluetooth, but I was heard clearly. I did pick up a bit of wind noise, but it was no big deal due to the wind-reduction mode. The battery life is superb. With ANC/Ambient on, Soundcore claims 40 hours and I am inclined to believe it, since I haven't had the need to charge them after almost 4 days. It can go 55 hours plus without ANC/Ambient on. I am also glad that there is fast-charging where 5 minutes on the charger gives 4 hours of playtime. One thing to note is that LDAC will drain the battery faster. Should the battery be completely drained, you can always use the 3.5mm cable (if your device supports that). You can control all functions from the tactile buttons on the cups, and that is a plus for me. The controls are responsive, and I prefer them to touch controls –especially in cold weather. The default audio is what impressed me the most. While I love listening to high quality sound from a critical standpoint, the Space Ones delivered a very pleasant sound signature. I found that the bass is a bit restrained but precise. The middle is well represented, making vocals, choruses, rhythm, instruments, and dialogue stand out well. The treble adds clarity without being harsh. There is ample soundstage and imaging with great channel separation. This is even more impressive once LDAC is activated on a supported device. Although subtle, I found that I appreciated the sound signature best with ANC on. Just in case, you can always customize the sound with the presets and full-range EQ on the app. Speaking of the app, I would highly recommend downloading it as it provides more options such as firmware updates, ANC/Ambient levels, control settings, LDAC support, multipoint, and many more. If there is anything to nitpick, I’d say that the carrying bag is disappointing, and I wish there were more options for the function button. In the end, you can easily say that I am overly impressed with the Space Ones, and certainly recommend checking them out. While definitely not audiophile quality level, or bass-head oriented, they are very pleasant to listen to. They are jammed packed with features that many more expensive headsets lack or are almost at the same level, and for the asking price, these are hard to pass."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these as a gift to myself and I couldn’t be happier!! The sound quality makes me feel immersed in whatever I am listening to. Love the options the app provides too! I learned a lot about what my sound preferences are by adjusting the different options available. Listening to music while I work with these on has helped my focus 10x more than just listening from my iPad or tv. The are sleek looking and the headband & ear cushions are so smooth too! The fold into a compact easy to travel with size & charge INCREDIBLY quick! Only have 5 mins to charge before you leave the house? You get more than a few hours worth of power. Can’t stress enough how ecstatic I am with these Soundcore headphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: LIGHT - These Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones are the lightest headphones I\'ve ever worn (and I\'ve worn many). COMFORT - It is clear that Anker wanted to ensure that comfort was one of its priorities because these are VERY comfortable to wear. The ear cups are large for all ear sizes and the weight distribution is very balanced. OPTIONS - To get the most out of these, you will need the Soundcore app which allows you to equalize and set up your own sound profile. It also has 22 preset EQ settings depending on the music you like. Audio jack and cable included! Transparent mode allows you to listen to your environment. TECHNOLOGY - Noise cancelling features are excellent especially while music is playing simultaneously. They have ""Adaptive Noise Cancelling"" which is supposed to adjust with your environment, although it\'s sort of hard to tell what changes. CHARGE - 5 min charge gets you 4hrs and a full charge gets you 40-55 hrs. USB-C cable included, but no wall plug SOUND QUALITY - So crisp and adaptible. CONS: PORTABILITY - These don\'t fold so if you\'re carrying them, they\'ll be full size. This is understandable though because less hinges means the headphones remain lighter. BUTTONS - Lots of newer headphones have touch and slide features on the sides of headphones, these have buttons. On the other hand, it\'s good to have that tactile feel, but this one is up to user preference. DURABILITY? - I put a question mark on this because only time will tell. However, I\'m skeptical of the soft material on the ear cups and the upper headband. At least the headphones come with a duffel carrying pouch to protect them. Bass? Check. Mids? Check. Treble? Check. Highs? Check. I highly recommend these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My honest review for the sound core headphones, let me start off by saying this headphones are probably one of the best mid priced in the market. My review will be based on 4 features on a scale from 1 to 10 / Style/ Comfortability/ Sound and Specs. Style: based on my experience the style is great but not the best looking, it lacks a bit of a modern feel. The material tends to have a fingerprint magnet, I am constantly needing to clean my headphones. Other than that I like color way. Comfortability: I have big ears and with that my ears get tired when using over the head headphones, with these Soundcore I have been really impressed. I use my headphones mostly the entire day and have not had any complaints or felt my ears sore from use all day. The material on the ear cups have a soft foam with leather and big enough to cover around the ear. The band is also made of the same material and comfortable. Sound: by far best sound I’ve had for a mid priced headphones, the audio quality is very premium. The audio drivers are very well designed making it a perfect balance. I’ve tried the audio with a different big brand and listened to 8D music and by far the sound is very crisp on these Soundcore headsets. Specs: one the best features it has is the ability to have two different devices connected at the same time. I work in the office and use my headphones for music and have a laptop connected so I can hear if anyone messages me. This is an awesome feature. Another great feature is the ANC support, I tell you it blocks everyone out when having it turned on. The best feature from this headphone is the battery! One of the best batteries I’ve had to experiment. I can charge my headphones one time and use it the whole week with ANC turned on and will have battery life at Medium charge. I will stand by this and proved to have the best battery life. Final: If you’re looking for a great headset that has amazing battery life, great audio performance and great comfortable design. Then this headphones are for you. It may not have the best styles but with other great features that makes up that part. I give this headphones 9.0 out of 10 or 4.5 Stars. A great pair to have.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m so happy I decided to try this brand! The look of the headphones is so sleek and beautiful. You don’t need to buy beats. Look into other alternatives like I did bcuz these beat out the best. The ear pieces sit comfortably on your head and ears, but of course, pressure overtime will start to feel slightly uncomfortable, but these don’t!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They work very well. I wish they were slightly lower profile for fit. Connecting is seemless and battery life is great. The noise cancelling and ambient option for sound is a huge plus. Sound quality is adequate. I have to spend more time with them to get a full picture of the range but hey seem very clear. My father was raving about the clarity of the microphone for a conversation we had for an hour.

SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset for PlayStation,$419.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation/18594534/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easy to setup , it’s pretty much plug and play. The quality is crisp and captures a wide range of frequencies. The noise cancellation works pretty good and has a sound pass through feature. It comes with an extra battery for the headset so you don’t run out of battery. The additional battery charges with the receiver unit. The headphone is well-built and feels premium. The receiver unit is easy to use, intuitive to operate and has a display. The receiver is pretty big and occupies space on the desk. I wished it could be either compact or somewhere dock-able with the monitor stand. The battery life is really good.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall this headset is simply amazing from the Durability to the sound quality to the customizations that you’re able to do it . I Use it for PS five games also for talking on the phone and it’s as well as watching movies on my TV. The headset comes with two batteries so you always have one Charged, While you using one battery for the headset you could be charging the other one in the charging port. I like the fact that you’re able to customize the audio settings for the battery Port interface. The ability to customize your headset is awesome I was able to put “ Wicked cushions” On with no problem. The Headset is very well-made and will not break on you. My only wish for this headset was so ability to raise and lower the volume of people talking during games you have to do that manually In game which kind of stinks.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After a lot of research on different types of gaming headsets, I decided that since I was putting together a gaming setup I'd bite the bullet and picked up a set of these. Let me tell you that they do not disappoint! They are amazing! As a FPS player the 3D sound is amazing. You can hear footsteps not only left to right but you can clearly tell if its above or below you. As far as what some say about bass levels this headsets gives you a clear, overall blananced sound profile. If you have an opportunity to grab a pair of these, I would definitely not hesitate. Overall build and comfort is great as well. Bottom"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I came across these headphones on a Google search because I wanted to replace the older model SteelSeries. To make it easier to read (and write): 1. [CONNECTION] Not entirely wireless. Comes with a base box to plug into a device incompatible with its Bluetooth capability, but no wires from headphones to anything. Connects fine with my S21 Ultra phone, but need the box to connect to PS5. 2. [SOUND] Video game sound is 4.8/5. Music is 5.0/5.0. Overall sound is 4.8/5 (It didn't score perfectly because every now and again there is an annoying feedback. 3. [FIT] Like someone holding soft pillows on the ears. 4. [NOISE CANCELATION] Allows for immersive gameplay, exercise, and/or meditation. When it's time to submerge into a project with music or just submerge yourself in sound, put these on. 5. [OVERALL] I think you'll be happy with your purchase of these headphones, but I wouldn't mind trying some other headphones just see how they compare."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Outstanding headset with one big flaw, and that being some kind of notch on the inside of the earcups that rubs against my ears. I think it has something to do with noise cancellation. That is about the only issue I have with the headset. They sound much better than the previous model (which still sound good). The mic performance is excellent when it comes to discord and phone calls. There's tons of background noise where i work and the mic cancels it all out. The build quality is much better than the previous model. The previous model that I have is somewhat falling apart. Ultimately, a great headset that I have to return due to the comfort problem. Whatever that thing inside the ear cups that rubs against my ears is a no go for me and is very uncomfortable. I have the previous ones and there's still some life in them so I'll use those until I find something better, the next model comes out. I found a video that shows what I described. I made a screenshot of it."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The ears are very spacious,the sound quality is very good and nicely adjustable. They are also very durable ive had them since release and they have not gone down in quality. They are a bit pricey but they are very worth it, its the best headset ive ever had. highly recommend!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Owned for 1 year now. Sounds in Black Ops 6 are amazing (Sucker Punch, custom EQ set in the DAC (All Freqs Maxed Out) able to hear footsteps, reloads with pretty good positional awareness. I do not use the GG software (too many running processes) DTSx Headphone app works good but costs $20 USD for lifetime use with updates and usually have to select it each time I boot up the Computer. ANC is reason I purchased, Very good EXCEPT I recommend Wicked Ear Cushions as they are Thicker and the metal ANC microphones will not touch your ears! The DAC is easy to learn and has several tweaks for personal adjustment. Dual Batteries are awesome, 4 to 5 hour use with ANC and Hot Swap to keep on playing! Mic quality is OK.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The has to be one of the best sounding headsets I have even had. The sound quality is outstanding. The headset is great for gaming and a must for all gamers.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headset are amazing sounds incredible and loud I really recommended!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve owned several higher end gaming headsets and this is hands down the best yet. They are not without a few flaws but over all experience is fantastic. Out of the box sound quality is outstanding and the software allows the headset to be EQ to fit your own needs. No head shaking bass by default but that can absolutely be EQ\'d into it. I\'ve not heard any distortion while using the EQ either which is rare and evidence of a good quality driver. Great situational awareness is fantastic, they have a very solid 3d space you can hear and track where sounds are coming from, above, below, behind etc. These are well worth the upgrade from the previous version without going into technical reasons they are just hands down better, look better, sound better and I feel have a better build quality. Compared to a few others, I think these perform and sound better than Astro A50, A40 /w mixamp, Previous version of Steel Series Arctis Pros, they are ""On-par"" with my Apple Airpod max, in some situations sound better, the sub bass is impressive and comparable to my Shure SE846 IEM which is a $1,000+ IEM that has a dedicated sub /w lowpass filter. You won\'t find many negative reviews on these and for good reason, they are expensive but worth it. Some confusion I\'ve seen the difference between the Xbox version and the PS5/PC version. Here is what you need to know on that. If you have all 3 and plan to use them wirelessly with all 3 get the Xbox version. If your PS5 is close to your PC and you want to switch between the two without unplugging anything, get the PS5 version. The xbox version basestation has a dedicated xbox usb port and 1 normal usb port, the ps5 version has 2x usb ports so the PS5 version will work with xbox but not wirelessly. You\'ll have to use the 3.5 cable and plug into a xbox controller, flip side the xbox version will work with both PC and PS5 wirelessly but you still only have the 2 usb ports and the xbox one will ONLY work on xbox leaving you to 1 port so you can\'t hook all 3 to it at the same time.']"

I used the ConsumerReports.org site to verify that. There was a better sounding option for more money, but it did not use the regular 3.5 mm jack and so it's compatibility with my PS4 controller and Samsung GS4 Smartphone was questionable (review said it worked with some Apple devices and had 4 connectors instead of the usual 3)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm not an audiophile or anything, but I love these headphones. Previously had them in blue, but got the silver ones to match my ipod touch (they were in stock). Sound is clear enough for my listening to music in the office and at the gym, and audiobooks. Earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Great price point as well."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones provide a balanced sound at an affordable price. They do very well blocking out surrounding noise and come with various earplug covers so you can choose which work best for your ears. I'm on my second pair - lost the first one - and will probably continue to seek out this model when I need another pair."", ""I've been using Panasonic ergofit earbuds for about a decade now and they're always comfortable with good sound quality.

Sounds way better than the nova pros but i ended up giving these away. I rather deal with lesser audio quality than uncomfortability. These are really heavy and had to return wicked cushions bc it made it worse, which is a first. If Audeze/ sony makes a lighter pair with similar audio quality, ill be ordering but for now i cant. Also cant ignore the widespread quality control across users with those delicate planar drivers', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound quality and very comfortable. The only downside is the mic isn't outstanding, which at this price, it should be."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Incredible gaming headphones. These are the ones to get if you're looking for that rich deep bass or if you're looking to replace your surround sound theater system. They're that good. Other headphones felt like you were hearing gaming headphones. This feels like you're hearing a surround sound home theater system. I haven't tried the mic yet but from video reviews I hear its just fine. They're a tad on the pricey side but if you're looking for that speaker replacement and total sound immersion for your games and movies or even music on your PC or laptop these are it. Highly recommend!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for gaming but have only used them for music so far. The build quality is supreme and comfortable. If you are a bass enjoyer like me then these headphones will take some getting used to. You can definitely hear the bass and it is nice and clean, but you can’t really feel it if that is what you are into. However I began to appreciate a clean crisp bass over thumping headphones. Both bass styles are good but with the mids and trebles sounding so good with this headphone, the bass performs just fine. You can hear everything with these headphones and i felt more immersed into the music. Just waiting for the PS5 pro to put these to the gaming test, which I expect tbe Maxwell’s will knock out of the park.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Best headset out there fr. You can hear everything from like a mile away.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Incredible headphones. I tested the Pulse Elites before these and they both sound pretty much the same. I'm no audiophile, but compared to the Pulse 3D, you can really tell the difference. Aside from the sound, the comfort and quality of the headphones are top notch. They are heavy though. I tried them for a day when I had a flight and every couple of hours, I'd have to take them off. At home, however, I can sit with them for longer with no issues. Overall, well worth price. Especially since I can switch between my ps5 and other devices."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headset was without a doubt a great sounding headset, however there are several things I want to point out. Pros: Audiophile sound, comfortable, bluetooth, good battery, and good mic. Cons: this one for me was the reason I decided to go elsewhere, the mic monitoring has an awful amount of feed back, even if you turn it down very low. I Have the astro a50x and even though that headset also has feedback, it is far less. Also the software is mediocre. sometimes disconnects, so i think that Audeze needs to go the mixamp route, those little usb sticks dont cut it for pro wireless headsets. If none of the cons bother you than this might be your headset, however I believe the headset should cost $200 at most, the price point is hefty for what it doesnt offer. 4/5 good but not great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ive had mine about a year and its my third audeze headset. (Had the penrose and still own the lcd x) mic quality is outstanding for a headset mic. The sound quality is top notch and incredible spacious comapred to the penrose. The penrose was plenry loud. More than the steelseries ive tried. Battery life is up to 90 hours. I charge it maybe once every two weeks and when i do the battery barely has gone down. The 90mm planar magnetic drivers are well optimized for gaming.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound quality is second to none among wireless headsets. The headband is SO uncomfortable no matter what setting it's on. I've bought and tried two aftermarket headbands and one set of ear cups and none of them fixed the pain on top of my head from wearing these. Also there is static when you use sidetone, no matter what. I don't care because I don't use it, but pretty sad for a $300 headset.""]"
Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 USB-C Open-Ear Bluetooth Headphones - Steel Blue - Only at Best Buy,$199.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/shokz-openrun-pro-2-usb-c-open-ear-bluetooth-headphones-steel-blue-only-at-best-buy/18904771/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased these to replace a set of over-the-ear earbuds that gave up the ghost. I go through about a pair every 6 months or so (battery fails, they fall out and get stepped on, etc.). I was hesitant to try these, but I am glad that I did. The wrap-around design means that you can pull them down off of your ears, and they just stay put around your neck. The sound is good, and I have asked a few people about the phone call quality, and they have all said that it\'s fine. I was a little ""cautious"" about the Best Buy blue option, but it was on sale. It looks fine, and I don\'t have any problems with a garish color or anything.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the way these sound, and the ability to easily hear others when they talk to me without having to remove an earbud. It is almost as if there was music playing in the room and someone was speaking with you. This is hugely valuable when sharing a space with people. I also like the feeling of openness to the environment and ""presence"" when cycling or walking. I was a bit concerned about buying the steel blue model even though it was on sale, as the blue looked somewhat gaudy and childish/cheap in the photos. But it looks great in real life, more subtle and appropriate for a solid piece of equipment. Very pleased. It does sound a bit softer than other headphones I have, so I find myself setting the volume higher.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have gone through a ton of wireless earbuds and I'm not a huge fan of the tips being in my ears all the time!

Many of them made by Shokz. Was not very havy with the sound quality untiled I purchased the OpenRun Pro 2. The sound is actually surprisingly good, they are super comfortable, and easy to forget you're wearing them. They are great at the gym, out and about, while eating at Chick-fli-a, or even in beb. I couldn't find a set of headphones that I could comfortably wear in bed until i purchased these. Extremely happy with them and would recommend to everyone looking for open ear headphones."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have the OpenRun Pro and now the OpenRun Pro 2. Love both. The bass is deeper in the Pro 2 and the power plug uses a USB-C. These are great because they do not impede the surrounding sounds allowing me to carry on conversations and be aware of what is happening around me. They are very comfortable and in a lot of cases, I forget I have them on. I wear them while on phone calls and Teams/Zoom meetings. I like them so much, I have purchased multiple pairs for gifts.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have the open pro run for 2 years. I was always thonking something was missing!! The upgrades 2 version is the answer!! They sound amazing with clarity, sound balance, and the app has been overhauled to have preset EQ soung options and 2 custon EQ sound presets that fit your listening sound needs! These sound better than ear pods and not irritating you ear canal by being jawbone sound. Be sure to look up how to measure your head to get the propper fit. .', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm coming from 6 years of using over the ear headphones. The OpenRun Pro 2 are incredibly light weight and the fit is extremely comfortable. It's a luxury not having something jammed in or covering the ears and easy to forget you have them on. I use 99% for phone calls, frequently for hours daily. The ANR works very well. For casual listening the music quality is much better than expected. Get the App! It's straightforward, easy to navigate and trouble free."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Compared to the previous versions of Shokz bone conduction headphones, these are much improved. The sound is richer: better bass and much clearer highs. Older versions were very mid-heavy and muffled. Another improvement is the feel of the bone conduction. The feeling of your temples “vibrating” from bone conduction has reduced significantly, so it feels more like regular headphones. Very lightweight and easy to wear, this was worth the upgrade!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this device after spending some time with a sales rep discussing the fact that I only wanted a device if it was capable of reading text messages allowed to me when they arrive on my iPhone. The sales rep did some Google searches and reading within their data database and said that this unit had that capability. If it does, I have been unable to figure out how to make that work. I did submit a question to the question and answers section asking for clarification about this feature, but apparently my question has been rejected as it has not appeared in the listing of Q&A items nearly a week after my purchase. In addition to lacking this critical feature, I have found that the audio quality for calls is less than desirable, and rigid structure around the back of my neck interferes with collared shirts and jackets. I will be returning this item.']"

Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Graphite Grey,$474.05,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sennheiser-momentum-4-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-graphite-grey/17684197/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these headphones from Best Buy a few weeks ago( a nice sale at $100 off) and I’m glad I did, the sound quality is superb!! The headphones are pretty lightweight and very comfortable for long periods of wear, nothing compares to these bad boys in one area and that’s battery life( 60 hours) I’ve had them 2 weeks and now and only charged them once. The design is nice and sturdy, not Air Pods Max quality build but for a plastic build very good. The App to set sounds and customization is pretty clean and well organized.. My only complaint about them would be they are a little on the quiet side compared to others out there, so if you want ear splitting sound than these will not be for you, but the quality of sound and bass are exquisite, overall these headphones are great and I’m glad I bought them over some of the others I was looking at.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headphones are amazing!! They’re so easy to connect and they have Smart Control you press once and it plays or pauses slide to pick the phone up go up and down and turns volume up or down, it’s actually so easy you do not have to touch your phone to do anything! The sound it’s next level game changer. You can customise the sound but honestly have never had such quality sound on headphones before! The battery it’s soo good they last for days which is good for me as I always forget to charge my gadgets and everything else. They are super comfortable they feel like they’re not even there! And they come with a case to keep them safe! Absolutely love them!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely unreal 100% noise cancelling for me which is a big plus in the gym, the battery feels like it lasts forever I’ve only had to charge them once since having them. The sheer attention to detail and branding is minimal but effective these are extremely steady and I have no trouble running with them on they sit still on my head and are adjustable the music quality through these is unreal I honestly could go on and on with how amazing this product is you connect through and app and can adjust almost everything to suit you I love that you can use the right pad to adjust volume play/ pause fantastic technology', 'I’ve owned Sennheiser headphones since my first experience with Sennheiser in 1974 and their classic HD 414 headphones that were revolutionary in those days and brought me allot enjoyable musical pleasure. Bought these Momentum 4 Copper Edition August 2024 and their sound is superb and very balanced across the sound spectrum, but if there is a slight criticism, the bass could be a bit sharper and punchier in rock and smooth jazz audio that I listen to, but its nothing to be over critical about, got these at a great price not new but hardly used. Great product and I’m very happy with them so far. I suggest that users sign up and get an additional set of the MOMENTUM 4 Earpad Black.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have never had such an amazing case going with my headphone! The finesse, the design, the sound, everything has been made to have a very comfortable experience wherever you are! You can even adapt the sound to your type and the case will protect your headphone no matter where you leave them. I recommend them!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just wow! I put these headphones on for the first time yesterday and they felt very soft and cushioned around the ears. I've never had a pair of headphones like these if I am honest, but their sound quality Is next to none and the noise cancelling works really well. Would definitely recce to a friend."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are almost everything I could want - comfortable, lightweight, excellent sound quality, noise cancelling. To be honest, I am not an expert audiophile, but these headphones offer technology and sound quality which seems to be top of the line for me. These connect to a Sennheiser app to improve audio control as well. They certainly outstrip my Beats headphones or Airpods in terms of sound quality. They come with all the cables you need and a very nice carrying case. However, the carrying case is large so they are not particularly convenient to take around - and because they switch off when you lie them flat, I wouldn’t recommend carting them around without the case. The size of case is the main downside. Also something to note, there are touch controls on outside of right earpad, which are quite sensitive. All that said, for someone who values sound quality in a wireless package, these are excellent and I would recommend them. They are not for someone who wants a small pocket sized wireless option, and where size comes first. I had the opportunity to try these headphones for free in exchange for my honest feedback.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Super lucky to have been picked to trial these wireless headphones with handy protective case 🎧 such a clear and crisp sound quality during use. I love that they are very high tech and work with the magic of touch control - no having to fiddle about with apps! That being said they do have a compatible handy app to help connect to devices and have up to 60hrs of playback battery life, meaning they can be used for a workout without worrying about wires! Haven’t ever trialled a product like these before, a definite recommendation.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing sound, and even more amazing when you consider the price to performance ratio. I compared these headphones against Bose QC45 and Ultra, as well as Sony 1000 XM 4 and 5, Beats Pro, Apple Max headphones and several other highly rated brands….and the winner was the Sennheiser Momentum 4 wireless headset with noise cancelling that would make a meditative monk feel lonely. And the complexity of the sound stage is exceptional and immersive. Battery life is exceptional at 60 hours. Very pleased with these headphones.', 'I have this along with my Bose QC Ultra and I should say this headphone is the best in class. You can EQ to the best of your liking. The bass is the best in class, literally you can hear a good bass thump. Happy and very much recommendable purchase. This is my daily driver headset.']"

You can’t go wrong with this purchase.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear headphones everyday for my job , and for fun . I have been threw alot of headphones cheap to expensive, and by far I love these. They are noise canceling, easy to use, Bluetooth, and the best part is if you move them off your ear, it automatically pauses your stuff. So no more having to stop and pause manually which helps especially for my job. I'm love they come with a really nice case, easy-to-use, and carry anywhere. You will love these . The quality alone is so good. Just love them. They last forever before you charge them. The best I say for sure. Obsessed!!"", 'I bought this headphone today and the unboxing to connecting to Bluetooth, setting up the app, to the knowing how to operate the headphone is thrilling', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. ', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always look forward to getting new tech. Less so, when I am replacing an item like for like due to a breakdown or fault. Less so too, if I’m just getting an upgrade to an existing piece of kit that I have. No, for me, the real excitement begins when I get a piece of tech that I haven’t owned/used before. Step forth the Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. Sure I’ve had headphones, but not the noise cancelling variety. Resplendent and shiny new in what Sony describe as their environmental packaging initiative. No plastic in the packaging and the Product Box is made using Sony’s Original Blended Material. I took a further look in to this and it appears that the headphones are also made of recycled materials. I don’t tend to buy items based on their environmental credentials, but seeing the attention that Sony are giving to it, it clearly is something that a lot of people care about. I would even go as far as to say, it’s woken me up to the fact and I should be a little more considerate in my buying habits going forward. The first impression you get is one of quality and environmental consideration. Nice one Sony. Once you get inside the box, which is worth keeping to protect your headphones case from future misdemeanours, you are greeted by a further case, this time in a grey hard cloth finish that is attractive and functional. Undoing the gold zipper just helps build the anticipation and once fully opened you aren’t disappointed, though at first sight I am surprised at how little is in the case. But wait, those crafty folk at Sony have worked some magic and as I start to explore I realise that everything I need is in the pack. A discreet flap hides the location of the headphones cable and USB charging cable. The first thing that strikes you is how beautifully styled the headphones are. Everything is colour matched in a quality matt black finish. They’re light and softly rounded rather than futuristically angular.They ooze quality. Considering this was new tech to me, I was a little anxious about understanding and mastering it’s complexities. I needn’t have worried. The sleeve (Again in recycled material) that contains all the documentation shows a QR code that when scanned takes you to a User Manual for the headphones. Next, download the Sony Headphones Connect App. Follow the instructions makes setting up the headphone's simple. Sony have also included a variety of options that allow you to trial for free any one of four music streaming services that provide the 360 Reality Audio Experience. The good news is that the trials are for three months+ in most cases, giving you ample time to trial your chosen service. The concept of the 360 Reality Audio is that instead of you hearing the sound in just a stereo environment it is relayed to you as if you were in your very own musical sphere. I may not have done it justice with my description but I can promise you the most wonderful listening experience. Clarity and depth are the words that come to mind to describe it. To get the best listening experience you have to create your own personalised profile. Again, a really simple experience that involves using an app to guide you. The app assesses the shape of your head and ears that allows the software to build a unique profile to enhance your listening. I saw a TV drama only a few days after I started using the WH-1000XM5’s and the lead character in it said she only listened to her music via headphones. Strangely, that is something I’ve begun doing myself since I got the headphones for all my music listening except when using the radio in the car. The noise cancelling element of the headphones is brilliant. The first time I used them brought back to me a recent flight I took that lasted over four hours. Had I had the headphones then I would have used them to cut out all the background noise on the plane. I fly about five times a year so they will be invaluable to enhance the quality of my journey. In use, the headphones are simple to use. You can do most things by using the touch controls on the right headphone. You can play, stop, pause and skip through tracks while raising and lowering the volume just by moving you fingers in a particular direction. The same actions can be used when taking calls. If you cover the whole right headphone in the cup of your hand the sound is reduced to a mere whisper allowing you to listen more attentively to your surroundings. Combine this with the Ambient or noise cancelling button on the left headphone and you can alter the sound to include the local ambient noise or have noise cancelling on. With music playing you can speak and the sound cuts out allowing you to hear your voice and locality more clearly. Any alerts on your phone are acknowledged with a sound in your headphones to keep you in touch with the rest of your social network. Remove the headphones and the music playback pauses and restarts when you put them back on. So useful. By now you may be beginning to realise how much I’ve fallen in love with my Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I love them, and can’t believe I haven’t found myself searching them out before. I use them at my computer while working (Even wrote this review while using them). When my wife chooses to catch up on her soaps or talent shows of an evening I slip the headphones on and take myself to the immersive sound experience created by my WH-1000XM5’s. However to conclude this review, a word of warning. When I started using them I found myself moving about the house singing along to the tunes I was listening to. I was having a great time until my enraged red faced wife tapped me on the shoulder and told me to stop the noise. Maybe Sony should put a warning on the packaging discouraging those of us that can’t sing to be mindful of others around us when we use them?"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ## Design - No folding available in this iteration, just the usual cup tilt and pan. Works for me, don\'t mind the lack of foldability. - I personally appreciate the new design and can describe it as far more sturdy and quality feel. No more plasticy sounds when adjusting the headphones or moving your head - The cups are comfortable, with memory foam, coated with some kind of artificial leather - The proximity sensor is no longer visible(compared to M4), but is still there - Headband is comfortable and narrower. However, when at the gym and bench-pressing/dumbbell fly they still slide back off my head. - Approx. 5gr lighter on the scales than previous models. I can\'t really tell the difference when wearing either model, so doesn\'t make a difference to me but appreciate the change. Overall a welcome change. The cups seem a bit thicker in profile than previous iterations but overall with same comfort and nice fake leather coating material. Those are a fingerprint magnet(if you have the black headphones). Yet I prefer this design. The mics are quite visible though and given the grills are the trademark bronze/gold colour they stand out. Not really a fan of that color choice but given what it provides in other departments I have made my piece with it. Might not be for anyone. Definitely though would prefer the mics grills color to be same as the cups color. ## Active Noise Cancelling and mics - 7 visible mics positioned strategically around the ear cup for noise cancelling and voice calls - wind noise reduction is significantly improved (in NC mode only) - while listening and for the other side of a phone call - voice calls recipients no longer complaint about muffled or unclear speech, difference is quite audible. - Adaptive mode is very accurate in changing profiles both action and location based. Super useful in your everyday commute, gym, run/walk and in the office due to personalised ambient sound levels available through the app. You can save frequent locations with predefined ANC/ambient sound levels. Manually entered several of those and all worked well. But that is more on usability and the mobile app, yet worth mentioning. Overall very happy with the improvement in noise cancelling, especially in windy conditions such as the one I encounter every day in my park walks. Gym feeling is the same top notch. ## Buttons, controls and inputs - Same two button operation plus the same gesture controls as before: double tap, swipe up/down/left and right and tap and hold with palm - Still no dedicated button for multipoint connection control. You can pair the headphones with two devices and switch between them but only through the app. I really believe a dedicated button provides far better user experience - Same USB-C charging with fast charging available - Same audio cable provided to connect to your device if you do not want to use wireless - Same touch controls on the right cup, quite responsive and with nice sound feedback ## Connectivity - BT 5.2 - I appreciate that every iteration is supporting the latest BT protocol - Same frequency response as previous models in wired or wireless mode ## Features - Supports most Digital assistants - Google/Alexa/Siri - Connected apps option - chose what connected and supported app to run when double or triple clicking the NC button. I am using Spotify and when double click the NC button music starts playing from that app. - Speak-to-chat feature where once you speak transparency mode is activated until your voice is no longer picked by the headphones mics(5/15/30s or auto timeout). No more sing along in this mode :) - Battery life claimed is same as previous models - around 30h. I managed to get ~22h(100% down to 20%) with adaptive mode on and volume 30-50% . Quite a good deal. It could be different for you based on your prefered volume levels, EQ and NC mode. Worth noting that I received a firmware upgrade(1.1.1) right after the test. ## Sound - Playing the same song with default EQ seem to give this new XM5 a clearer mid-range than previous iterations(XM3 and XM4). For the casual listener I doubt it would make any change. For me personally I always use the EQ to adjust mid-high frequencies and also crank up the Clear Bass to +7. You must hear it for yourself with your favourite track to be able to appreciate the difference. - Quite a big technical change is the new drive - 30mm down from 40mm but with some better insulation and lighter mats such as carbon. Frequency response is same both wired and BT. All that signifies a change in the drive cavity and how bass resonates to produce the same quality low frequencies. - Each and every one of us has slightly different sensitivity for different frequency bands and self preferences as well therefore a head to head comparison of the output over a microphone(with different frequency sensitivity bands and possibly remastered post recording) gives some perspective but is in no way a fair depiction of what you, yourself, might take out of those headphones(or any audio device for that matter) and classify as ""good"" or ""bad"". Overall seem like an improvement(in the mid-range frequencies) and very much so appreciated. An audiofile will definitely hear a difference if comparing with predecessor. I still do and yet I am not a professional audio engineer. Given everything I mentioned, if you had any previous WH1000X model, I can describe this new one as a good step forward. In any other case prepare to be blown away. Coming from the other two brands competing with Sony will still feel very different and an improvement in most aspects. A very welcome upgrade I\'d say - noise cancellation, audio quality, connectivity(with the exception of multipoint management) are all top level. A must have for travel on the tube, going to the gym or for a walk in the park. Adaptive ANC is brilliant. I very much want to see a hardware change for multipoint device management on the headphones themselves. Maybe a dedicated button to switch between connected/registered devices. Also, can\'t wait to see what Sony can offer in future iterations with regards to further improving noise cancelling, especially dynamic wind noise removal and would they offer multi-drive and true DD5.1(that would be amazing!) version of this product one day.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The connection to my new Sony headphones via Bluetooth was extremely easy, the headphones themselves ooze quality and are comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time, this is probably helped by there light weight. The sound quality is out-standing and even when listening to an audio book in a very noisy environment, the noise cancellation works very well, letting you hear just what you want to hear, even the carry case is well designed. So these get a rare 5 stars from me.']"

I’m really picky about choosing only earphones that don’t have those annoying silicone tips that go IN your ears (they feel super uncomfortable to me and never fit, ending up in the earphones always falling out), so I was glad to find these. It’s a decent pair of earphones for the price (I happened to get it on sale for $79.99). The audio isn’t the greatest, but if you’re not super picky with how your music sounds, it’ll be fine. Mostly I find it is a bit lacking in some ‘push’ in the lower registers/bass of some music. If you adjust the settings with the Urbanista app, it sounds a lot better than the default sound you get out of the box. It works smoothly and I’ve had no problems with it so far in terms of connecting. The tap controls are a little fiddly, and the case feels a tiny bit fragile, but I did accidentally drop it on a metal object and it didn’t break or get damaged. It’s small and smooth, so getting some sort of carrying case for this would be good. In all, this is a good pair of earphones for the price. There are comparable brands that have earphones at this price point (like Sudio) but this is a good choice too.']"

I use it all day long. I use it for my online classes, and I also use it when I play games on my Switch. It is so easy to install and set up. I just connected the USB-C wireless dongle to my laptop and installed the Steel Series Engine. Also, it comes with a wire so if your headset is not charged you can still use it. I really like the detachable microphone. I only use the microphone when I am taking my online classes, so it is convenient to be able to take it off when you are not using it. Also, you can hear so much more with this headset. I play games on the Switch and when I put the headset on, I can hear things that I have never been able to hear when I play with just the normal sound on the Switch.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Headset looks simple but look great. Connecting the headset is very simple, to connect to an iPad Pro and any Samsung device that uses a USB-C. No need to go into any settings. Just connect the dongle to the device and power up the head set. That's it fast and easy. With the included connection wires the headset can be connected to consoles and laptops. When listening to music or gaming or anything for that matter, the surrounding sounds get blocked out or barly heard. That depends on how high the volume is on the head set. Sound is crisp and clear with no distortion or lost of vocals when the bass hits. They are not to heavy and after wearing them for some time there was no signs of discomfort."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These SteelSeries Arctis 1 are my first pair of wireless headset I’ve ever owned for gaming... As a PC/Xbox One player I constantly switch between the Xbox app on party chat or a chat room on the Discord app and I’ve had zero issues with this headset. Battery life is amazing for the price!! I play usually 5-6 hours through the day and I find myself charging the headset once weekly. I AM NOT KIDDING!! Battery life is really good and doesn’t take too long to charge up to 100% either. Charges using MicroUSB not USB-C. Has a mute switch and a single dial for volume. Has a detachable 3.5mm mic port. Brings a 3.5 mm to connect to other devices where Bluetooth is not supported. Uses a USB-C wireless adapter to connect directly to a Nintendo Switch if you want. The design is simple and not too heavy or tight around my head. Mic is super crisp and clear, all my fiends knew I had gotten a new mic because they told me I sounded like I was next to them talking. I recommend this to anyone wanting to transition from a wired headset to a wireless headset. Of course SteelSeries has many other headset options but for the price and what you get, it really is the headset I can easily and comfortably recommend to anyone.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this headset to replace my aging, crappy headset. My original headset was the Turtlebeach ear force stealth 700 gen 1 which was $150 when I bought it 5 years ago. The Steelseries Arctis 1 is $50 cheaper but the quality way surpassed the more expensive Turtlebeach’s. The steel headband provides great clamp holding the headset snuggly in place without pushing too hard to where it’s squeezing your head. If you drop something and bend over to pick it up, this headset will sit in place instead of crashing to floor as you forgot you were wearing the it. The material they used to create the ear cup cushions is top notch. It is very breathable and comfortable as they don’t use vinyl or pleather but instead choose a breathable fabric. You can easily wear this headset for hours and have no discomfort, personally tested and I have a big head. I haven’t been on the receiving end of the mic so I can’t not speak to quality of it. I haven’t experienced anything bad with the mic yet. The mic being detachable is a plus. Sound wise, this headset can get pretty loud and while it does have good bass it could be better. Sound quality is great for gaming as I’m always able to hear footsteps and gunfire behind me in COD and Valorant. The battery life is absolutely fantastic. I no longer have to hide mid game in a panic because my headset died and I need to plug it in. This headset will make it through an entire day of gaming before you start pushing low battery. My only gripes with this headset are the facts that it doesn’t support Bluetooth and the headset receiver being usb type c is a little ahead of its time. While they do proved a standard usb to usb c cable it’s more a burden then it is helpful if your device don’t support usb c.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are a nice headset.

They are lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time and that is something gamers love. It has a volume button that's easy to use during intense game play and also a mite button.

My voice is clear, however when I play back a recording, I can heat the cat purring near me, as well as clatter upstairs. While gaming, the case seems different as others had trouble hearing me, until I raised mic volume on the console.""]"

They have a simple effective design. They look good. They feel great on the ears for long periods of times. The RGB lights are all but an after-thought, but still add s little flare in a dark gaming environment. The band keeps the headphones in a very nice, super comfortable state while I'm gaming. The omni directional mic sounds great to my online friends and the Dolby soround feature gives me the absolute creeps when pllaying Resident Evil and keeps me vigilant while playing Call Of Duty. The mute is perrfect for when I need to yell across the house without being ragged on by my fellow games. Yeah, it happens.There's a very long braided cord allows me to lean around and grb snacks or products off camera, to show to my followers in mylive streams. And I hav to top it off with, not only is this a really, really good pair of headphones, they are at a great price. I'm very big on getting the affordable products into the right hands or on the rught skulls, in this case. And these , in my humble opinion, are a great buy for gamer/streamer in your live. Especially if that gamer is you. Get these."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve used a few different gaming headsets from Logitech, Alienware, and Razer, but this is my first experience with a Corsair headset. The HS80 seems like a great value with built-in RGB and a premium build. As nice as the headset looks, it doesn\'t seem to fit my head very well and has sub-par audio quality. === PROS === - The headset feels very premium. The top of the headband is a soft-touch plastic, while the headband that touches your head is a soft, plush leather-like material. The earcups are very well padded and are a nice, soft cloth fabric. There is a nice weight to the headset that makes it feel substantial and not like cheap plastic. - The earcup openings are quite large and should fit most sizes of ears. - The microphone is attached to the left earcup and is very easy to flip up or down as needed. The microphone mutes itself as soon as you flip it up, and a red LED on the tip of the microphone will turn on to let you know that it is muted. Microphone quality is excellent with minimal background noise and crisp vocals. This is probably the best microphone quality I\'ve heard from any gaming headset I\'ve used. - The USB cord is plenty long (roughly 6 feet), though it cannot be detached from the headset (which would make it easier to travel with). - The iCUE software is straightforward and makes it easy to customize the RGB lighting on both earcups. The RGB lighting is subtle and not over-the-top. The Corsair logos and the microphone tip are the only LEDs on the headset. - The headset uses a ""floating headband"" design which means that it adjusts to your head immediately when you put it on your head. No manual adjustments are required. === CONS === - The headset is comfortable, but the earcups do not seem to fit snugly around my ears or fully rest against my head. The bottoms of the earcups protrude out ever so slightly right above my jaw, failing to make a tight seal and letting in ambient noise. Maybe it\'s just the shape of my head, but I haven\'t had this problem with any other gaming headsets or headphones. It\'s not a deal-breaker, but you might want to try this headset on in a store before you purchase. - The microphone is not removable. I sometimes go days without needing to use a microphone, so it would be nice to be able to detach it as needed. - The volume and microphone mute controls are awkwardly placed on the back of the left earcup. I would prefer to have these controls built in to the USB cable, which would be more easily accessible. - To me, the audio quality of this headset is mediocre at best. Everything sounds very distant, muted, and muffled compared to my Alienware AW510H headset. They get plenty loud and have pretty good performance in low frequencies/bass response, but vocals, music, and in-game dialogue just sound very muddy to me. I\'ve tried tinkering with the equalizer in iCUE and noticed some minimal improvements. Turning on ""Dolby Atmos for Headphones"" in Windows audio settings also seems to help. But as soon as I switch back to my Alienware headset, I can immediately tell how much crisper and clearer they sound. === OVERALL === The Corsair HS80 certainly earns the ""premium"" label in terms of looks and build quality. Its RGB lighting effects are tasteful and easy to customize through Corsair\'s iCUE software. The microphone is easily the best I\'ve ever used in any gaming headset. I just wish that I could slightly adjust the fit so that the earcups created a full seal around my ears. As it stands, there are no adjustments whatsoever that can be made to the fit of this headset. If you\'ve had issues with other headsets fitting your head, I would advise that you head to your local store to try on the HS80 before purchasing. Audio quality seems just OK to me, though this will come down to personal preference and the amount of time you have to tinker with the equalizer settings.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset really took me by surprise by the overall quality. I’m constantly surprised at what you can get these days for such a low price. As I’m used to having to buy expensive headphones/headsets to get good sound. But that is no longer the case. I use the words “exceptional” “fantastic” “stellar” “blown away” and I never use those worlds unless my worlds been rocked. And this headset did that. BUILD QUALITY: It’s great. It’s mixed with metal and plastic parts. The hinges are all metal but the top of the headband is plastic. I am able to put a lot of torque on it without it breaking but do notice some creaking there. Which is the only creaking that I’m able to find on the entire headset. I notice very mild microphonics with the cord. The cord itself is NOT removeable which is a bit of a bummer. It is also only about six feet long which to me is a bit short as I’d expect most people’s PC’s to be a bit further away than that. So, you may need to buy a USB extension. The cord itself is wrapped in rubber and very malleable. COMFORT: The earcups swivel mildly toward the front (anteriorly) and 90 degrees to the back (posteriorly). There is very mild side to side play. The headband is very similar to SteelSeries headsets where you have a piece of cloth (not the correct word but the only one I can think of at the moment) that sits across your head that perfectly conforms to it with a little piece of faux leather. You adjust how much pressure is on the top of your head by adjusting the Velcro in the band (see picture). The earcups themselves are soft velvet like material that is very breathable but doesn’t have any memory foam like some other headset. Instead is just your typical padding. Clamping for to me is just right. Where it may be a bit snug when you first put it on but then it loosens up quite to the point you forget it is on your head. It is snug enough that if you shake your head it won’t fly off and just moves a bit. Overall, I find the comfort to be good/great. MICROPHONE: It’s excellent. It legit blows my mind and I NEVER say that. Honestly, if I didn’t know it was a headset microphone I would swear it was a studio mic. Even my friend who is hyper critical of headset mics thought the same thing. I didn’t test like noise rejection or if it picks up other people in the room (as my environment is quiet). But I find that this is good bass and mid tones making my voice sound full with good body. I’m also extremely clear. You can tell there is some mild compression but not in a bad way. There is also flip to mute. Or you have a button on the left earcup that allows you to mute it when pressed. In ICUE software that can be paired to whatever else you want it to which is cool. There is also a red LED that you can see when it is muted. Easy 10/10. SOUND: TLDR: It is excellent. Mids are VERY present which can sometimes be overpowering to the rest of the sound. Bass is excellent but doesn’t overpower things. Highs are there but the most reduced. Imaging and directional quality is phenomenal where I can hear every nuance sound and even track people down through walls. Making it an excellent all arounder for competitive games along with single player. But excels more with multiplayer games over single player games. Music is alright. Media is great. I love the sound on this guy. As it makes me feel like I’m actually THERE in the world. Really adding to the immersion factor. Physical speakers can be great as you can get this tremendous bass response that makes you feel like you are there and somehow they are able to do that same thing but in a headset. Which I’ve almost never seen before. Even with my >$600 studio headphones. The bass is just epic. But not to the point where it muddys everything up and makes other things hard to hear. It is a mid-focused headset meaning that mids can be a bit bloaty and overdone. But that allows you to hear footsteps really well and I think is the main factor making the sound feel like it is all around you making the immersion feel real. Highs are crisp but a bit veiled. Where you can definitely hear them just fine but get you about 90% there. Sometimes depending on the game this mid focus can be a negative effect as it highlights sounds that are supposed to be quiet and boosts them to be front and center overpowering some of the finer and softer sounds. Finding collectables and enemies was easy. I found that FPS and competitive games were its bread and butter. With Single Player Story Driven games also being above average but is where I started to get into some trouble depending on that games mix. Music was good but not great. Media was excellent as again a mid and bass focus really adds to the immersion. Directional quality is fantastic where I can track people through walls and even hear if they are above or below me (depending on game and with Dolby Atmos ON). Imaging is also fantastic where I can hear every nuance of sound easily with nothing blending together no matter how many sounds are coming at me at once. Again, blown away by the sound here. Another 10/10 for immersion and competitive gaming. CONCLUSION: Yeah this headset is a banger and I highly recommend it. I don’t think you can go wrong with it. Honestly, despite having a lot more expensive studio headphones this will probably be the pair I grab when gaming. As I just love that it makes me feel like I’m there in the world hearing every sound and direction it is coming from. Well done Corsair.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Corsair headset HS80 is great for gamers and streamers. This specific headset is not wireless. The cable length is fine but I find it kind of short for my taste. It is about 6 feet long so depending how far away you play from the tower that will determine if it is too short for you or not. I ended up using an extender to fix that problem. This headset is very well designed, looks high end and is extremely comfortable. The ear cups are very well padded and if you wear glasses it fits well. Adjusting to a different size is simple and this will fit pretty much any size but I will say it’s a better fit for someone with a medium to small size head. One thing I noticed is that the ear cups retain fingerprints. I like how responsive the volume wheel and the button to change the profile EQ is pretty neat. I do wish it has some type of way to alert you when you change the settings, something like an announcer. The sound is pretty good and the Dolby Atmos feature is very good as well. My only complaint was that the bass is not as punchy and deep as I expected. The RGB lights are a nice addition specially on the mic when muted around the tip turns red. The mic is very good at picking up the player's voice. Online players were able to hear me very clearly with no issues. To mute, it has the flip up feature. If you want to take advantage of most of the features you will have to install the Corsair dedicated Cue software. With the software you can adjust pretty much everything within the headset from the sound to the RBG lights. Overall it is a good headset specially for the price. If you don't mind having a cable attached this is a good alternative, if you do then pay a little extra for the wireless version."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love it. The sound quality is great, and it’s even better than the wireless one a friend has. When I purchased it, it was 70 dollars due to a sale, but would definitely buy it for 100. When playing beat games you can really tell the difference. Granted the downside is that you have a cord limiting how far you can be from your laptop or computer, but that isn’t an issue for me. It is also very convenient having a mic that can mute just by moving it to the vertical position. If I need to say something to my roommate that I don’t need people in a game to hear, instead of muting myself through the game or on discord, I can just use the built in muting function. The other plus for me, is that it uses a usb port which is more study and secure than a headphone jack (keeping in mind my laptop has 3 usb ports). Overall, once more I love it, it’s comfortable, has good sound, and makes gaming or binging easy and enjoyable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] WHAT!?! HUH!?! Sorry, it’s just that the HS80 Wired headset from Corsair gets loud. Very, loud. Rich sound, 3D audio effects, built in RGB lighting, and an omnidirectional microphone combine to create a very solid headphone offering from Corsair. Essentially just a wired version of the Wireless HS80, these headphones look and sound great. Gamers looking for a comfortable experience with rich audio should check them out. Setup: In the box, you get the headset and its permanently attached 5.9ft USB cable. There is no AUX input. This is strictly a USB headset. To get the most out of your headset, you will need to download and install ICUE from Corsair. I’m using ICUE version 4.24.193 as of the time of this review. Initial Impressions: It’s a very sleek build. The speaker cushions are a cloth foam. The headset “breathes well”. After hours of listening to music, movies, and games, my ears never got terribly hot. In terms of comfort, you adjust the Velcro strap on the inside of the headband for a looser or tighter fit. I wish the USB cable were a bit longer, but at nearly 6ft, it’s still a pretty good length. But if you are plugging headphones in to a desktop PC on the floor, you may wish the cable were a bit longer. Experience: Audio sounds great. You get a notification for spatial audio when you plug the headset in that allows you to activate Dolby Atmos in Windows. There is also a Dolby toggle in ICUE that helps give a 3D effect to audio. Music, movies, and games have sounded nice. I can pick up a lot of details in music and gaming audio. I wish bass were a bit deeper. But this is a good sound. I’m liking it. The omnidirectional microphone does a good job picking up my voice. This is a refresh of the wireless version of the HS80. As such, there is one holdover in the form of a button on the back of the left earpiece. You can use it to turn the microphone on or off out of the box, but that seems pointless to me as it’s just easier to put the microphone in the up position. Now, you can assign that button from within ICUE. You could have it change your voice in Voicemod, change an EQ setting, or play or pause music. Negatives: There aren’t many. I wish the bass were a bit richer, but I still think this headset sounds good. The hard plastic on the earpiece is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. Conclusion: This is a solid headset from Corsair. If you are okay with a USB tether, this is a great gaming headset. I highly recommend it. 4.5/5', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair HS80 RGB headphones with USB connection are now my favorite gaming headphones to date. I did not think these would beat my go to Gaming headphones but boy was I pleasantly surprised. The HS80s are a USB only connection but the best part, they work with iCue and the adjustable nature of these are great as I already utilize iCue for multiple other Corsair products. The HS80 is a 7.1 Dolby headset with massive 50mm drivers tuned for 20hz to 40khz (even though the human ear cannot hear much if anything over 20khz) and is Dolby Atmos ready. The iCue program has the adjustability to turn on and off Dolby Sound along with Stereo setting. The Equalizer has some basic presets but I always fine tune my equalizer listening to a few videos of myself playing FPS and Sim Racing games. The 7.1 surround shines white playing FPS games for myself, compared to my headphones that were almost 3 times the price, these are faster reacting, true directional sound and I could even hear the footsteps easier. The long wire USB setup usually means low volume but not with the Corsair HS80s, they are loud but safe all the way to 100%, they will not blow your ears out but get ready for some killer immersion while gaming and even movie watching. Music also sounds great, very clear, no muddy sound, just clean bass, does not sound like an 80s Caprice trunk in a Sheetz parking lot at 2am bumping Eminem, it sounds like you are at the studio listening to him sing it right next to you. Also, with iCue, there are some RGB settings you can change to make the logo match up in color with your other iCue devices, great for that streamer like myself that loves uniformity. You can adjust the mic sensitivity, make the mute button a different key assignment if you please and even adjust the brightness of your color changing logo. Comfort is a HUGE plus with these, memory foam ear pads that feel amazing on your ears, hours of use and not one time have I wanted to remove them. The ear pads breathe quite well which makes for a no ear sweat and enjoyable gaming experience. The strap is an adjustable and soft band, being adjustable via Velcro from under than main hard material band. Looks are not boring at all and the tuck away mic is a nice touch. Flip the mic up, it is off, flip it down, it is on, great for when your kids or spouse walks in the room. I am extremely happy with the Corsair HS80 RGB USB headphones, just wish their RGB stand did not cost almost as much, it would be a great addition to my already growing Corsair and iCue setup. Pros: Fit and Comfort Looks iCue compatibility Amazing Sound 7.1 Dolby Wired and is long for great reach Works with Xbox and PC Much More! Cons: NOT A SINGLE ONE I CAN FIND!!! For the price, you will not be unhappy with this purchase, at sub $100, I do not think you can find a much better USB set of headphones and I have almost 20 pairs from years of testing and gaming, these would be my first choice to date.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound was a bit better than the Void RGB but, they heat up my bald head and the ear cushions started to fall apart after having them about a month. I’m returning them and going back to the cheaper Void wireless headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s good so my kids can game with their friend I absolutely recommend it', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] INITIAL SET-UP AND CONFIGURATION The Corsair HS80\'s check all the boxes for a common set of gaming headphones this day and age. They sport 50mm drivers, are compatible with Windows Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos, and support audio resolutions up to 24bits/96kHz. Additionally, as is a near requirement for all headphones these days, the beloved RGB lighting. Thankfully, Corsair has done a great job, showing a lot of restraint, by not pushing RGB overload to where you want to puke at the gaudiness. It is one of the best and most tasteful implementations of RGB lighting I\'ve seen to date. USE AND PERFORMANCE The HS80\'s do a good job at their intended purpose. Thankfully, Corsair has integrated their headphones into their iCue software. The iCue software is Corsair\'s version of the Logitech G-Hub, Razer Synapse, etc. All of Corsair\'s peripherals can be controlled and configured via the iCue software. I love how the iCue software integrates with your system\'s bios and monitoring. Without any tedious tweaking, the iCue software allows you to monitor the systems\' vitals in real time without any additional add-ons. My favorite feature is that you can configure the RGB lighting on nearly any of their iCue peripherals based on any one of the numerous parameters the iCue plug-ins monitor. I typically have the iCue software monitor CPU and GPU temps. As those temps climb, I have the iCue give me visible feedback by color based on their current temps. It is slick and works seamlessly without eating into a ton of the system\'s overhead. Any iCue peripheral can be programmed with this visual feedback or all of them combined, or any other number of lighting options. Each peripheral is treated separately and uniquely in the software, allowing for different lighting customizations and options. The iCue software also allows you to tailor the headphones sonically. While the effects are noticeable, the HS80\'s definitely play on the warm side. Regardless of the EQ setting, the headphones perform better in the lower octaves than the higher ones. While this isn\'t a huge pitfall playing FPS games, it does rear its ugly head during music and movies. I won\'t say they sound awful, far from it, but the HS80\'s do not have the upper frequency clarity that many of their competitors do. I tried numerous built-in EQ settings, manually adjusting the EQ settings, and finally just setting the EQ to flat, and I was never able to fully liven up the upper octaves. They are a ""laid back"" sounding set of headphones, geared toward what I would consider a single mission. NEGATIVES The included USB-C cable is too short. Clocking in at only 6 feet, it didn\'t cut it for me. Someone with a PC at the far edge of desk or on the floor will immediately need at least a 10 foot USB-C cable to be comfortable. While I applaud the iCue software for its versatility and thoroughness, it all comes at a price. That price is space. The iCue software has now ballooned to almost one full gigabyte. That is a ridiculously large size. That is also just the installation file, not once it has been extracted and installed. Ugh. The HS80\'s are capable of reproducing audio at 24bits / 96kHz. However, the iCue software does not do an adequate job of allowing you to setting the audio quality or giving you feedback at what is playing. While I understand the audio quality is fully dependent on the source material, the iCue software only allows you to turn the surround sound on or off and I did not see any real way to go and fully optimize the surround sound. For that, I had to open the Windows Audio property app to fully tailor the sound. This should all be able to be accomplished in the iCue software. My JBL headphones allow me to do it within the app, even allowing me to enable my Dolby Atmos or DTS:X Headphone extensions within their app. An oversight on Corsair\'s part. FINAL THOUGHTS If I needed a set of headphones geared specifically for gaming, these HS80\'s are a worthy consideration. Game playback is first rate and the included microphone picks up voices clearly and intelligibly without transmitting every single background noise it can hear. The 50mm drivers do an awesome job at reproducing the lower octaves, even if they give up detail and clarity in the upper frequencies. Games sound awesome on the HS80\'s. However, for me, headphones needed to be able fulfill different missions. They not only have to excel at games, they have to be great at movies and music too. In that regard, the HS80\'s come up short in my book. I will give them 4 stars because of the awesome gaming prowess, but only 3 stars for music and movies. Recommended.']"

They pair quickly with my iPhone, as soon as I take them out of the case, they are paired. I only had to set up Bluetooth pairing once and since then I've been good to go! I also love the controls that allow me to quickly skip songs and pause without needing to touch my phone. These have been amazing and this is not something I'd normally purchase for myself, but I highly recommend getting these!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I highly recommend the Belkin SoundForm Bolt Wireless Earbuds. I love the purple color on them, more importantly I love the sound. These are great wireless earbuds, they fit in my ear perfectly and also have more rubber earbuds to change out to find the size that works best for you. These were so easy to use, take them out of the box sync them with my phone and you are ready to go. I used the earbuds while I went for a walk and they stayed in my ear comfortably for the whole walk. I highly recommend these SoundForm Bolt Wireless Earbuds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tried these out after my AirPods blew a speaker. I like the forest green case and earbuds. The earbuds themselves are LARGE. They definitely run the risk of getting knocked out of the ear due to their size. They come with one set of silicone coverings to keep them in your ear and to cover the speakers. I was actually very surprised that the package only included one size which doesn’t allow for a good fit. Due to their size and not being adjustable these didn’t stay in my ears very well. The sound quality is good for inexpensive ear buds, but I wish that Belkin would have included additional sizes for the silicone coverings.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so surprised by how much I like these earbuds! First of all, the color is so cute but the quality really surprised me. It took me a minute to figure out the most comfortable position to wear these but once I played around with them, they fit super well. I appreciate that they included different-sized tips with the product. These also seem to have a bit of a noise-cancelling effect which is very nice and the sound quality is amazing. My only complaint is that the earbud case feels a little cheap but I don’t have any complaints about the earbud itself! Definitely a great product for the price!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like these earbuds. I love the color of them, and the sound quality is really good, especially for the price. The case is kind of bulky, though. The battery does last a long time, which is a good thing. The earbuds connect to my phone easily. The earbuds themselves feel a bit bulky and uncomfortable in my ears, even with the changed ear tips. Overall, I do like them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm quite impressed. The sound quality is crystal clear, and it's a delight to listen to music with these earbuds. Plus, the battery life is remarkable; I can use them for hours without worrying about recharging. What's more, they fit comfortably in my ears, making them perfect for extended use. Overall, a great product that offers a well-rounded audio experience.""]"

Will recommend it to my friends', 'I bought this a week ago and it work amazing and I sleep alot beetr know', 'Got this for no accidents award from Omnitrans while driving a bus', ""This was all tested out on an Android Pixel phone running android 8.1.0 The headphones were provided to me by the manufacturer so I could test and then review them. TL;DR - Solid everyday use headphones, comfortable to wear, decent sound, and decent features. This is especially true considering the price. Sound: They sounded good, the volume never got overpowering and I never heard any serious distortion. Things were decently balanced across the tonal range, (e.g. no distorted bass due to bad EQing by the factory.) Tried Rap, Rock, Metal, Folk, Bluegrass, RnB, Jungle, Dubstep, a variety of other EDM and Top40. Everything sounded decent, at a good volume level without distortion. Occasionally on very complicated pieces (lots of instruments and midrange vocals) it may get a little muddy, but this was the exception. The headphones also block out a lot of the ambient sound and environmental noise. I think this was helped by the snug fit. Regardless, it meant that the music I was listening to didn't get overwhelmed by outside noise and sounded good even when not at full blast. This helped me keep the volume levels lower and everything sound crisper. Fit/Comfort: They fit comfortably on my large head (wear a size 8 fitted ballcap), over the ears. They fit snugly enough to stay on my head while moving around, but not too tight. There was not much weight to them which was great for long listening sessions. While wearing my glasses as well, the headphones still fit comfortably. They don't pinch my ears or drive the handles of my glasses into my skull, no headaches! I will say after a few hours of wearing them, they will get a bit of sweat on them. Easy enough to wipe off. Use: The bluetooth synced up without issue, and I got every bit of the 33ft range with good signal, and clear sound. Charging was simple, uses the same USB cable as a ton of android phones and other devices so losing the cord is not a huge problem. The battery life was pretty good, I got every bit of 4-5 hours on my long listening sessions before the battery was empty. It did a good job of holding a charge. Left at 50% charge, a week later it was still sitting right there, and that listening session it still drained at its' normal pace so overall I still got about 4.5 hours or so off the original charge. They fold up pretty easily, making them small enough to tuck into a purse or backpack for travel. They are springy enough to survive getting a little squished in the bag. Controls on the ear piece are pretty straightforward. They have little raised bumps on them so you can figure out where your finger is without having to take them off and look. The buttons click easy and are responsive over the bluetooth. Mic: I did try this out on a few phonecalls. The mic is handy, but it is a bit quiet. This is primarily due to the fact it doesn't face your mouth/stick out in front of your face. Nice when you get a quick call and you happen to be listening to music/using the headphones. The controls on the earpiece are easy to use and let you go straight back to listening to whatever once the call is over. Probably not as good for a work conference call where people need to clearly hear you at a loud volume level."", 'I received my headphones on 1/21/21 as was scheduled. I read the easy to operate instructions, charged my headphones which took no time at all. The sound was like having a home stereo without disturbing the neighbors!', 'Sound is amazing. They actually sound better than the beats headphones I have. I also bought the Ilive phone charger for my Apple phone and Ilive tailgate speaker I’m very happy with all of your products', 'I bought this two weeks and I love them, they came in clutch for my trip and they definitely are noise cancelling. You literally can’t hear a thing with them on and I love that because usually with other headphones I previously bought I could hear everything around me as I had them on and now these are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased. I highly recommend!!', ""I wore these headphones with no problem until a couple of months ago. When I tried to take them off at the same speed and direction I always do (grab the top and slide them forward off my head) they got tangled in my hair and somehow, the minimal force of trying to pull them off my head caused them to snap where my hair had wrapped around the left earpiece. I tried to tape them but they don't cover my ears completely anymore and won't stay in place. I still use them because I can't afford another pair and they are my favorite, but there should definitely be some kind of warning that they should not be worn with loose hair because they will not stand up to the pressure of hair pulling on them."", ""Got it a while back as a gift. Pros: +feel comfy +functional bluetooth with no real problems +comes with audio jack (as well as charging cable), which is super handy and allows use even without power +good audio quality +collapsible +fast charge time Cons: -the collapse method always makes a loud cracking noise which makes me think I'm breaking them but im doing it as it says to and they work totally fine so its just a matter of hardware, may not be consistent across devices -mic is not very good at all, due to it facing away from you -potential cheapish feel (mine have a very nice matte finish, but the non matted plastic does seem cheap) Overall a very nice set of bluetooth headphones for the price."", ""I got this yesterday and i love it the battery last's a really long time.

Overall it’s a bang for your buck', ""Bought this last week, it arrived today and i have used it for 5 hours already. I was considering the kraken x or the blackshark v2 x. It didn't disappoint and glad I made this choice instead. The sound and mic quality is very good. People can hear me very clearly. Padding and ear cushioning is also very comfortable. The only issue with it is the ear cushioning does get a little warm after wearing it for a long period of time. With previous headphones the earpieces did not feel very comfortable if wearing glasses, but no issues with blackshark v2 x. Very good Razer. Definitely would recommend this."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Greatest headphones I’ve ever had.

I am huge into audio and I can confidently say that this headset puts out. No lag, just plug and play. The spacial audio sounds awesome. I can tell when enemy is nearby with the surround sound it delivers. You can control your volume and mute if needed. I not only highly recommend this product but I also bought one for my wife and other family members to play with haha. It is corded but the line is plenty long enough!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The BlackShark V2 X is certainly a step up from my previous headset (Logitech G230). The build quality is solid and doesn’t creak when moving or adjusting like the G230 did, the sound and mic quality is solid for its price range, and its aesthetic is pretty sweet (especially if you decide you want to role play as a helicopter pilot). I’ve used it for both PC and Xbox gaming and haven’t had any issues, although I do wish the boom mic was foldable like many others in the segment. I do very much like the easily accessible volume knob and mute switch on the left side. Overall, I recommend this for anyone looking for a solid gaming headset without breaking the bank!', 'The audio sounds just as good as. My $150 headset, and the mic sounds even better. I bought to have a wired set in when my wireless is charging. I might just use this one full time. Pros: Super comfortable, great sound, great mic, volume adjustment easy to find, smooth adjustment and good build quality. Cons: Mic isn’t detachable like the pricier standard V2. Overall great product for the money. FYI I bought on sale for $60 CAD. I would have shopped around more at full price.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For this price , the quality you get is insane, I had a great experience with gaming with these head set and the convenience was great , I booked these in the day and picked it up 20 mins after, great services by Best Buy .

No echo on chat and very comfortable. Comes with two options for connecting to PC/controller/etc: one regular aux jack and one aux cable extender with double male aux splitter on the end (so you can hear audio from two sources ie pc and phone or pc and xbox, etc).', ""pros ~ - it looks and feels very nice. - This mic is clear and the sound is great, probably better than anything I have used before. -If you are like me and are looking for something that works on PC, Mac, xbox, and has a mic, then this is perfect. - Very light. If you just find the perfect spot, you barely notice they are there because they weigh only 240g. cons ~ - Seems to be designed for long heads, and might not fit you if you have a really small head, although for me it fits fine. - It is not small. Like, you probably won't be carrying this around even though it comes with a cloth bag.""]"

HyperX Cloud Alpha Over-Ear Gaming Headset - Black,$89.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/hyperx-cloud-alpha-over-ear-gaming-headset-black/14522915/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset is perfect for me. I play video games minimally 8 hours a day and I swap from console to PC. I use this headset for everything except my phone (it can connect to my phone if I wanted it to) and let me tell you - if feels very comfortable even after extended periods of use. If you're used to headsets from the ASTRO brand, this might feel like a bit of a down-grade because there's no volume mixer with this headset - only volume up/down & mute. There's also no software for customizations like you would get with the HyperX Pulsefire Raid but you really don't *need* it with this headset. (No software for this headset is part of why I gave it a 4/5 stars - if the HyperX mouse can utilize software, a headset should too) The microphone is detachable so you can use it for just listening to audio if you want to. Though I don't recommend working out with this headset as it will get moist fairly quickly and thus become uncomfortable. The cord length is nice as well since it's not too long and it's not too short; the only issue is that it can tangle itself up pretty easily which can be annoying (This being the other reason I only gave it 4/5 stars) HyperX is a very good brand though and with them I don't feel like I'm paying a 'logo premium' like you might feel from certain other brands. It's also very durable, I've dropped this headset many times on the ground (concrete flooring) and it's not been scratched or damaged or anything. Overall would highly recommend this headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I thought I’d buy my son a better option headphone, Sennheiser, during the holidays for his PC; they were recommended as a better option, but more expensive.

If you play online you will notice an immediate difference and advantage. Footsteps are extremely clear and you have extra time to adjust positions and prepare. You can also game for extended periods with no discomfort, the headset is sturdy but not heavy, and the ear cups are very comfortable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I owned a pair of HyperX Cloud II’s for around 3 years, I admit they could’ve lasted me longer if I had taken better care of them. After owning those classic headphones I knew that my next ones had to be from HyperX again, they’re just that good. I bought the Cloud Alpha with high expectations and they did not disappoint. The build quality is fantastic, the earcups are nice and squishy and the headband feels great in your head. It also doesn’t push into your skull. The sound quality is amazing and really well balanced while still having that emphasis on footsteps for the gamers. The microphone is surprisingly good and clear.

Feels comfortable even with my winter hat. Great sound!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TERRIBLE CHARGING MECHANISM. DO NOT BUY. I have tried to love these things for over a year now. Great sound and the fit is awesome. But they are basically useless now. The buds themselves, mainly the right one in my case, rarely charges. I believe it to be a combination of the case design and the magnet/pin setup that is being used. I have been frustrated countless times when I show up to the gym to find one or both of my pods are dead. Please Beats, fix this problem and take care of everyone who has purchased these because I can almost guarantee they will experience this issue if they haven’t already. Oh, and this is my third set of these, under warranty. So it isn’t a fluke. BTW, all of the attached photos were taken within the same minute…', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are my second pair purchased. They are some of the best earphones I have ever had and that is including my AirPods Pro. I purchased the second pair to take with me on the go while I use my first pair to strictly use around the house. Absolutely nailed it by Beats! So many great features in a compact design made for everyone no matter what the activity. 1. Fit: With AirPods it is a miss or hit with fit and keeping them in the ear. However, the Powerbeats Pro eliminates the one size fits all and includes ear hooks for stabilization and different ear tips for various styles of fit inside the ear. Everything works great to provide an excellent fit to deliver a truly excellent experience. 2. Sound Quality: This is where the Powerbeats Pro shines. It becomes very apparent the single linear piston drivers are at work along with the H1 chip to offer up some truly awesome sound also, with the larger form factor to provide a bigger speaker with the Powerbeats Pro they can deliver an above average sound quality which could possibly rival the best competitors. The highs, mids and base will not disappoint the listener at all. 3. Water Resistance: A must where I live. With an ipx 4 rating a person doesn’t have to worry about rain or moisture. Not submersible waterproof but enough water resistance where a person won’t have to take cover if caught out in the rain. I’ve already had this to happen. 4. Battery Life: The Powerbeats Pro really do last right up to the 9 hours promised in my experience and the case is accurate with approximately 24 hours more of a charge. Awesome on power management and battery life with both the earphones and the case. 5. Price: The Powerbeats Pro come in at $250 and is a little pricey but considering the electronics is placed in both earphones and not one side as typical with other brands it makes the pricing just a little easier to handle. Also, since the electronics are placed in both ear pieces, that means a person can listen to one or the other earphones and not be stuck with a dominate predetermined side for listening. 6. Physical Controls: Love the physical controls on both ear pieces. Authentic clickable buttons for those who are tactile. I’m one of them and feel the physical controls just can’t be beat any other way. 7. Pairing: The pairing with Apple audio devices is quite unique. With the W1/H1 chip the pairing is ridiculously easy. a. Once paired with any Apple device, the pairing goes to iCloud and automatically pairs with all your Apple devices that is signed in to the iCloud account. Just so very easy. 8. Comfort: The Powerbeats Pro, if nothing else, are extremely comfortable. The ear tips fit into the ear snug and seals great. I can personally listen to music for hours and never feel discomfort with the ear hooks or the ear tips. Again, that is personally speaking. It’s a no brainer if a person is in the market for more than a casual pair of earphones and want all the benefits of sound, comfort, fit, style, long battery life and water resistance the Powerbeats Pro is a must have pair of earphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Powerbeats Pro wireless earphones have amazing sound. I gave my apple ear pods to my daughter because these have a much better sound and bass. They have crystal clear sound and phone calls sound so clear. They have just the right bass and treble and I couldn’t be any more happier than I am right now. Opened the case and they automatically connected right to my IPhone 11 Pro Max without any trouble and each ear pod gets around 9 hours of play and around 24 hours with charging case. Excellent quality and comes with iPhone charging cord and different size end pieces to go in ear. Very pleased with these!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earphones - Apple H1 Headphone Chip is the best wireless earphones to date for me. The earphones fit comfortably on your ear and stay in place. The earphone case because it is compact and easy to carry. Sound quality is bar-none. Easy to use, easy to charge. A cord is included but has a different plug than Apple items. Comes with instruction booklet and extra ear buds.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've heard a lot about these ear buds and was super excited to get them. The sound quality is amazing and I love that I can adjust the volume on the ear piece. When I got a phone call from my mom she could hear me perfectly and the phone wasn't close to my mouth, pretty impressive. I've noticed they have cut out a couple times and the phone was right next to me, but other than that, I love them!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these to replace my Apple Air Pods and my Beats Pro. I needed something lightweight, compatible with my iPhone 12 Pro Max as well as my Note 20 Ultra, and had great sound. These buds were exactly what I needed and wanted!! They are water resistant as I also use them to workout and in the sauna. The only con is that they grow uncomfortable when wearing with mask for a long time.']"

I would give quality an 8/10 because it is not for a beginner but other than that its an awesome controller !', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There are many aspects to this controller that make it incredible! First, the texture. I absolutely love the grip of the controller. The grip is all over from the handles to the triggers and it really helps. Next is the recon option. The ability to turn the volume of the headphones or the chat up or down from my controller is so beneficial. One last aspect of the controller that I will mention is in regard to the wire. The wire is super long which means I don’t have to be right next to the Xbox. One bad thing that I don’t like is that I can’t feel the difference between the trigger and the bumper due to the grip bumps. On a normal controller, I can feel the change in buttons with my fingers from the bumper to the trigger. But other than that, I absolutely love this controller!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this controller this week. This controller is absolutely fantastic. I also have a Turtle Beach headset, the headset with this controller is incomparable to the stock controller I received with my Xbox. The controller can be held comfortably in my hands and the features, like the mute button ON the controller, is absolutely amazing. The wire for the controller is long, which is really nice. I don’t have to sit on the floor to play. I will definitely recommend this product to all of my friends who have Xbox systems. I am VERY impressed and could not be more excited to continue using this.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this about a week ago and am very happy with it. The controller has a good feel to it and seems like it is made well and durable. I like the grip feeling on the hand placement and top buttons, has a better feeling then my other remotes while using it for a long period of time. The chord that comes with is extremely long and durable as well. The buttons above the Xbox button are a new feature for me that my old controls did not have and they make it a lot easier to adjust the volume during chatting than what my old ones had. Overall very happy with the product and would recommend to anyone as a good option.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The controller is great, it has so many features, not only is it remappable, if you plug in a headset into the controller, you can control the audio of the controller and even use super hearing mode, i think the only thing that could be better is maybe add an extra two triggers, but for the price it's great."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this product a few months back and ever since it’s the only thing I use when I game! It’s by far one of the best remote I’ve had. The unique features and cool design, overall a great gaming experience. I would definitely recommend to anyone who uses Xbox .', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] To start off with, this controller works amazingly on my main system, my PC! I started using it and loved how it felt compared to my standard Xbox controller. The bumps on the triggers, as well as the extra ones in the back make playing on it very enjoyable. The only issue with that is I lose some of the Audio functionality using it on my computer. I also tested it on the Xbox, and it works great, the Audio functionality and different controller profiles came in handy, and so far is my favorite controller. I’m only rating this for 4 stars since it is a great controller, but the profiles on the controller aren’t the easiest to set up, it is much too light at the bottom, and the buttons/triggers feel less durable compared to a normal controller. Pros: - Excellent size for large handed people - Profile Switching for Audio and for Controls - the ridges on the buttons prevent slipping - the two extra back triggers add a range of functionality - the USB-C connector ensures I will always have a cord - the included cord is very long - rubber hand grips also prevent slipping - the D-Pad design is very nice Cons: - the plastic doesn’t feel as durable as standard Xbox controllers - The controller is too light at the bottom, even compared to other controllers without battery packs, making a noticeable annoyance as the controller tilts towards the top - getting the controller profiles set up takes a bit of tinkering, and time to get done to your liking', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The controller has a really sleek feel. The channels in the grips of the controller really helped when I was grinding because no matter how long I played my hands never got slippery. The D-pad is one of my favorite features of the remote, it’s design really helps out on combo moves for fighting games. Another feature I liked was the easy to program buttons on the bottom of the controller. I love how you can program them for up to 4 different games and it is seamless to change them between games. I enjoyed the advanced features of the mic for smooth and clear interactions.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Turtle Beach branded Xbox controller is a great addition to my Xbox Series S I recently bought. It works really well and the grip on the controller makes it easy to navigate. I like how Turtle Beach has made improvements to the original Xbox branded controller so it is more user friendly. 5 stars!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing controller.The integrated audio controller is placed perfectly for use with your thumbs and doesnt disrupt gameplay at all. Highly recommend all around! The 10 ft cable is more than enough for me and the enhanced sound is amazing I can hear everything clear and crisp.']"

I work as a finish carpenter, these adequately protected my hearing from the saws, routers, and my co-workers bad taste in music.

The Bluetooth connection was a bit spotty sometimes, which is also a downer. The background noise cancelling stopped working after a few months as well, people would actually say that the background noise seems louder than normal. I do remodeling work, and appreciate the noise-reducing ear tips. Overall, it’s a good product and I was generally happy with the purchase, given the price and quality.

"ASUS ROG Delta USB-C Gaming Headset for PC, Mac, Playstation 4, Teamspeak, and Discord with Hi-Res ESS Quad-DAC",$193.68,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/asus-rog-delta-usb-c-gaming-headset-for-pc-mac-playstation-4-teamspeak-and-discord-with-hi-res-ess-quad-dac/13645953/review,"[""It's very comfortable around the ears, you can actually turn off or turn on the rgb, it also has a nice detachable mic and a volume control near by the rgb switch. The cable of the headset uses a USB-C, it comes with an extension to a USB-A and two replacing earmuffs for the headset."", ""I got this headset a while ago to replace my old headset that broke. One feature that stood out to me was the inclusion of quad DAC system built directly into the headphones, as it was the first pair I've seen to include a DAC inside the unit itself. I also really like the 50mm Essence drivers in the earcups. I can distinguish between the more trebly sounds and the bass sounds much easier. This along with the inclusion of 7.1 surround tremendously helps me while gaming as I can pinpoint the location of players shooting, moving, or reloading. The usage of USB-C is also nice as it makes it easier to use the headset with my phone without the need of a pesky adapter or dongle. The last thing that made me really happy is the ROG Hybrid ear cushions. As much as the smooth leather cushions are smooth and comfortable, I find leather to get hot and sweaty as it blocks airflow which is not good for long sessions of music listening or gaming. The ROG Hybrid cushions fix that by having a breathable fabric mesh on the outside and smooth leather on the inside so they don't rub your ears raw. Overall, the Asus ROG Delta is a versatile headset that can be used across many platforms and features excellent sound quality and comfort. With the Essence drivers and ESS9218 quad DAC being as powerful as they are I also found the headset to be quite decent for listening to music with. One criticism I have is with the Armory Crate software, every time I start up my computer I have to reactivate the Aura Sync lighting. The software also is a bit sluggish with delays loading pages and adjustments to the audio profiles. While these problems can be annoying at least they don't detract from the quality of the physical headset."", ""I bought this headset about 2 years ago, here is my review: The reason why i rated this headset a 3 is because of the build quality and sound The Sound quality is Excellent same as the microphone quality, but when it comes to the Build Quality, its kind of bad. CONS 1. 1 month after i bought the headset the microphone's rubber (in the outside) glue came off, and that resulted in the microphone bending down as it had no support to keep it up. 2. after 1 year of using the headset the plastic that held the headset together came off (i had to tape it together) 3. after 2 years of use the headset died, i don't know what happened but every time i plug in the headset the sound is very very loud and static. PROS 1. The sound quality is excellent! 2. it has volume, rgb, mute controls in the back of the headset 3. The Microphone quality is excellent. 4. it has various modes like: music, gaming, movie etc... 5. they include 2 types of ear cups. i Wouldn't recommend this headset but if you find that its worth it buy it."", ""I was expecting not too much to be honest about this headset but when I just try them on person my whole point of view just changed, the audio quality it's just awesome, the microphone quality it's exceptional and they are so comfty!!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Mega like the only issue is not wireless but even wire they are really good 3D sound capable and surround sound is excelent the side RGB light looks awesome.', ""Love this brand amazing equipment.

iLive IAHB48 Wireless Headphones (IAHB48) (IAHB48MB),$28.68,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ilive-iahb48-wireless-headphones-iahb48-iahb48mb/13630734/review,"['I just brought it but like it very much. Will recommend it to my friends', 'I bought this a week ago and it work amazing and I sleep alot beetr know', 'Got this for no accidents award from Omnitrans while driving a bus', ""This was all tested out on an Android Pixel phone running android 8.1.0 The headphones were provided to me by the manufacturer so I could test and then review them. TL;DR - Solid everyday use headphones, comfortable to wear, decent sound, and decent features. This is especially true considering the price. Sound: They sounded good, the volume never got overpowering and I never heard any serious distortion. Things were decently balanced across the tonal range, (e.g. no distorted bass due to bad EQing by the factory.) Tried Rap, Rock, Metal, Folk, Bluegrass, RnB, Jungle, Dubstep, a variety of other EDM and Top40. Everything sounded decent, at a good volume level without distortion. Occasionally on very complicated pieces (lots of instruments and midrange vocals) it may get a little muddy, but this was the exception. The headphones also block out a lot of the ambient sound and environmental noise. I think this was helped by the snug fit. Regardless, it meant that the music I was listening to didn't get overwhelmed by outside noise and sounded good even when not at full blast. This helped me keep the volume levels lower and everything sound crisper. Fit/Comfort: They fit comfortably on my large head (wear a size 8 fitted ballcap), over the ears. They fit snugly enough to stay on my head while moving around, but not too tight. There was not much weight to them which was great for long listening sessions. While wearing my glasses as well, the headphones still fit comfortably. They don't pinch my ears or drive the handles of my glasses into my skull, no headaches! I will say after a few hours of wearing them, they will get a bit of sweat on them. Easy enough to wipe off. Use: The bluetooth synced up without issue, and I got every bit of the 33ft range with good signal, and clear sound. Charging was simple, uses the same USB cable as a ton of android phones and other devices so losing the cord is not a huge problem. The battery life was pretty good, I got every bit of 4-5 hours on my long listening sessions before the battery was empty. It did a good job of holding a charge. Left at 50% charge, a week later it was still sitting right there, and that listening session it still drained at its' normal pace so overall I still got about 4.5 hours or so off the original charge. They fold up pretty easily, making them small enough to tuck into a purse or backpack for travel. They are springy enough to survive getting a little squished in the bag. Controls on the ear piece are pretty straightforward. They have little raised bumps on them so you can figure out where your finger is without having to take them off and look. The buttons click easy and are responsive over the bluetooth. Mic: I did try this out on a few phonecalls. The mic is handy, but it is a bit quiet. This is primarily due to the fact it doesn't face your mouth/stick out in front of your face. Nice when you get a quick call and you happen to be listening to music/using the headphones. The controls on the earpiece are easy to use and let you go straight back to listening to whatever once the call is over. Probably not as good for a work conference call where people need to clearly hear you at a loud volume level."", 'I received my headphones on 1/21/21 as was scheduled. I read the easy to operate instructions, charged my headphones which took no time at all. The sound was like having a home stereo without disturbing the neighbors!', 'Sound is amazing. They actually sound better than the beats headphones I have. I also bought the Ilive phone charger for my Apple phone and Ilive tailgate speaker I’m very happy with all of your products', 'I bought this two weeks and I love them, they came in clutch for my trip and they definitely are noise cancelling. You literally can’t hear a thing with them on and I love that because usually with other headphones I previously bought I could hear everything around me as I had them on and now these are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased. I highly recommend!!', ""I wore these headphones with no problem until a couple of months ago. When I tried to take them off at the same speed and direction I always do (grab the top and slide them forward off my head) they got tangled in my hair and somehow, the minimal force of trying to pull them off my head caused them to snap where my hair had wrapped around the left earpiece. I tried to tape them but they don't cover my ears completely anymore and won't stay in place. I still use them because I can't afford another pair and they are my favorite, but there should definitely be some kind of warning that they should not be worn with loose hair because they will not stand up to the pressure of hair pulling on them."", ""Got it a while back as a gift. Pros: +feel comfy +functional bluetooth with no real problems +comes with audio jack (as well as charging cable), which is super handy and allows use even without power +good audio quality +collapsible +fast charge time Cons: -the collapse method always makes a loud cracking noise which makes me think I'm breaking them but im doing it as it says to and they work totally fine so its just a matter of hardware, may not be consistent across devices -mic is not very good at all, due to it facing away from you -potential cheapish feel (mine have a very nice matte finish, but the non matted plastic does seem cheap) Overall a very nice set of bluetooth headphones for the price."", ""I got this yesterday and i love it the battery last's a really long time.

Corsair HS65 Surround Gaming Headset - Black,$89.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/corsair-hs65-surround-gaming-headset-black/16204861/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Over the past 5-6 years, I\'ve run through close to three dozen different gaming headsets in my search for the ""perfect"" set of cans and have auditioned, returned, recycled, kept, or retired budget, mid-tier, and top-of-the-line wired and wireless offerings from Razer, Hyper X, RIG, Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach, Sennheiser, Corsair, and SteelSeries. Does this latest offering from Corsair stand out amongst its competition--mostly. It does offer top-notch sound quality, solid construction, simple and effective controls, fairly deep customization options via the iCUE client, and outstanding mic performance. The only niggles I found during my audition and use were slightly finicky fitment and some minor but noticeable issues in surround sound rendering. The HS65 is what I would consider a budget-oriented mid-tier surround headset...it is obviously geared towards the gaming crowd but does not feature any RGB or over-the-top ""gamerish"" aesthetics or design flair. Each of the oval earcups features a reflective Corsair logo in the middle of a round honeycomb inset that looks like an open-backed speaker grill, but these design elements are strictly cosmetic--the headset is definitely closed-back and does a really good job with passive isolation of outside noise. The earcups are padded with very soft, glasses-friendly memory foam cushions that feature a satiny smooth fabric on the inner walls and on the cushioned surfaces that touch the skin, with soft PU leather on the outside--that same leatherette covers an equally soft memory foam cushion that runs along the entire underside of the headband. Earcup size is thankfully quite generous as the over-the-ear design actually completely enclosed my ears without any noticeable on-ear overlap. Time will tell how long the PU leather lasts before it starts to peel, flake, or separate, but this is an issue that is typical of every synthetic leather product I\'ve used over the past few decades. Despite weighing ~260 grams (with another 20 grams for the cable), construction is very solid with a mix of higher density plastic and metal for the headband--mine did not creak or feel cheap in any of my stress & bending tests. The earcups smoothly rotate a bit more than 90 degrees to fold perfectly flat for easier storage & placement on a desktop or table--sadly, there is no carrying case or even a cloth travel bag to keep the headset & USB dongle together. The rotating mechanisms on the earcup hangers feel reassuringly solid without any cheap looseness or wiggle; however, vertical earcup tilt is only about 5 degrees or so, meaning most fitment adjustments are accomplished through headband sizing and earcup rotation. The headband does not feature any numbers or hash marks so resizing has to be done by feel rather than sight/memory. Personally, I found out-of-the-box clamping force to be unusually high for a headset this light; even with all that soft padding on board, my ears became fatigued and the top of my head was sore after about an hour or so of play. Stretching out the headband worked wonders for me, but because the metal construction in the headband is so robust, I had to remember to do this every time I donned/doffed the headset or those hotspots and earaches would return quickly--YMMV. The flip-to-mute microphone boom is of a rather unusual design...instead of looking like a round, flexible bit of wire, it features a flat, rubberized ribbon-like design. I was a bit leery at first, but whatever memory-retention wire is inside the flat boom construction works very well to retain both inward and outward sideways bends as well as slight twists to get the microphone angled just how you want it without slowly creeping back to its original shape, even over longer gaming sessions. However, the thick-but-flat design does mean it is virtually impossible to bend the boom directly upwards or downwards (like a tape measure--it can twist and bend side-to-side, but you can\'t bend it straight up or down). In practice, however, I doubt that such precise placement will be required--the microphone seems to be of very high quality as voice capture was outstanding with no artificial DSP or watery sound. I was also concerned that the omnidirectional pickup would let a lot of ambient sound intrude into my gaming session, but that did not prove to the be case based on my sample voice recordings. The smooth rubberized headphone cable is captive on left earcup which is slightly unfortunate because you won\'t be able to replace the cable if the plug or earcup connection gets stressed and starts to go out on you...but again, this is a slightly more budget-oriented design so a few compromises to keep costs down are expected. The cable terminates at a combo 3.5mm plug so you can use it on virtually any source component with a headphone or combo jack; the flip-to-mute boom microphone folds completely vertical and out of your way, but it does not integrate neatly into the earcup as do some of the HS65\'s competitors. There is a single volume dial on the left earcup...that is the extent of the onboard controls. This simplicity is refreshing, though it cuts both ways--you don\'t have to remember what button or dial does what or fumble for the right controls in the dark, but it also means that every other significant function (EQ selection, sidetone adjustment, mic boost, surround settings, etc.) is only available when using the USB dongle on a PC/Mac with the accompanying iCUE software client. The soundcard dongle is a small USB pigtail that my iCUE client recognized immediately and even downloaded a new firmware update upon startup. Unlike most of the similarly designed gaming headset competitors I mentioned, this Corsair dongle supports high-resolution sound formats up to 24-bit/96KHz. Within the iCUE client, you have access to a powerful 10-band EQ with the range to make boosts/cuts up to 12 dB, as well as 5 additional presets: Pure Direct (flat), Movie Theater, FPS Competition, Clear Chat, & Bass Boost. In addition to adjusting microphone & sidetone volume, iCUE gives you an additional slider for up to another 10dB of mic sensitivity gain. You can also turn the voice prompts on and off which was actually helpful to indicate the status of the surround setting, mic status, mic feedback (sidetone), etc. If you get the white HS65 headset, you can even change the color in iCUE so a white headset shows up on your dashboard. There is also an option within the iCUE client for something called ""SoundID Personalization."" The idea is that you pick your preferences (A or B) from a series of repeating sound clips with slight adjustments to the sound until you get a custom EQ profile that is supposed to represent your preferences across multiple EQ bands. In practice, I found this setting to be useless because the repeating sound clips are only a few seconds long as opposed to the complex and variable musical selections, game, or video soundtracks I routinely listen to. Personally, I do not have much use for gimmicky EQ settings (although the Movie Theater EQ was fairly engaging and fun without being overblown in any one particular area) so I left the EQ in Pure Direct and auditioned a number of video games, movies, and songs I was intimately familiar with. Sound quality was exceptionally good, especially with high resolution audio tracks and streams. Bass *quality* was outstanding though these are not what I would consider bass-head cans...there was just a slight lack of lower-bass bloom and ""kick"" that actually made listening less fatiguing than normal, though I did miss the occasional visceral ""whomp"" of a deep bass guitar or a chest-rattling explosion. Mids and highs were positively wonderful, clear, detailed, and airy...if you enjoy high quality sound but are not a fan of extremely bass-heavy headphones, you will love what you get from the HS65s. The only area where the HS65s faltered just a bit was in surround processing, but you may not notice if you don\'t know what you\'re missing already. Corsair markets these as featuring Dolby Audio; but it is not the same surround solution as Dolby Atmos for headphones. The difference seems to be 7.1 surround in a 2D plane (iCUE\'s Dolby) vs. object-oriented all-around-surround (Dolby Atmos). During an Atmos-encoded demo track, Window\'s Atmos processing produced a smooth and uniform soundfield where the sound source moved fluidly in all directions including behind the listener and over/under. In the iCUE-based 7.1 solution, the soundfield flattened and sound sources that were behind and below the listener actually became almost silent. It was a subtle difference to be sure, and would only really show up in an Atmos-encoded soundtrack anyway, but as some games are now including Atmos mixes, pinpoint sound source localization could be affected. Still, in regular use, in-game immersion was thorough and compelling and only those already used to Atmos-based surround would likely notice the difference. The closest competition in terms of design and features is probably the Logitech G Pro X (pictured next to the HS65)...while the HS65 is less expensive, both are of similar size, performance, and mic quality, though I dare say the Dolby Audio of the HS65 is a bit livelier than the DTS:X 2.0 solution of the Pro X. I personally found the Pro X a bit more comfortable, but if you don\'t have a very large head, the HS65 shouldn\'t be a problem at all. Bottom line--if you care about audio quality but are on a bit of a budget, the Corsair HS65 is definitely a strong contender in the crowded mid-tier surround headset market.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve always been aware of Corsair but mainly through their PC fans and components. Then I had a chance to try their HS65 Surround Sound Gaming Headset and I was skeptical of what to expect from a gaming headset. I wasn’t sure if it would meet the same standards I had from using other names more recognized for their headsets. I was a fool! This headset is amazing and everything you’d want from a headset. Out of the box you get the headset with attached 3.5 audio jack and 90 degree swiveling ear cups and a 3.5-to-USB adapter (there’s also a warranty booklet and instruction pamphlet), its simple and short. Design of the headset is also pretty standard with a volume control on the lower rear of the left earmuff, a microphone on the front of the left earmuff, earmuffs the fold 90 degree to lay flat when hanging on your headset stand or wall hook, and soft almost memory foam like cushions for your ears. The top band is wide over your head and ratchets out to adjust for comfort so it always feels good to wear, not heavy but also a very durable heavy duty feel. The microphone is a thin blade of bendable rubber which is both minimal and allows for infinite adjustment for your preferences without sacrificing clarity of sound. Stylish too, the silver mesh with Corsair logo on the sides of the ear muffs is very appealing and cool! I used the headset for my PS5 playing “Horizon: Forbidden West” which allowed me to really feel the surround sound of the headset. As I walked across plains and deserts in the game I was able to hear robot creatures sneaking up behind me, in the hero’s base I could hear distant allies echoing from down metal hallways, their voices reverberating as if they were actually down the hall from me in my home while the friend across from me in the game was clear and crystal as if speaking right in front of me in my living room. Sound was highly adjustable, I normally play with the volume control at halfway but even that was too loud for me…I dare say you may never need to turn it up to full volume! Designed for console and PC gaming there was a feature I didn’t get to try called SoundID which allows for your sound preferences to be recorded and automatically used each time you play a game. Just calling that out because it seems like a cool feature, I simply don’t have a gaming PC to test that on. These are a real surprise and a very pleasant one at that! While I’ve never had reason to doubt Corsair fans or components, I just assumed nothing special from their headset and I was proven undoubtedly wrong! These are one of the best gaming headsets I’ve ever owned and I would highly recommend you look at these next time you’re shopping for a headset for your PC or console gaming system.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got it on sale as one of my Christmas gifts to myself, they’re very comfortable, i play games that involve proximity chat and have had no echo or feed back issues everyone says i sound clear, so far pretty durable i have a toddler that likes to steal my things and throw them around so theyve been well tested', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Corsair has done a good job at a reasonable price i had no issues on any of the platforms that I tried it on.

The articulation is perfect and the headband applies appropriate pressure without being overly tight against the ears. The ear cups are made from a soft memory foam that remains comfortable over long gaming sessions even when I am wearing glasses. The foam is not a cooling gel, but they don’t seem to retain too much heat. PC gaming is where they truly shine as there is more power and more customization. The iCUE software allows the user to take an audio test that helps tune the audio to the personal preference of the wearer. The software does make a difference, but I don’t like that the software does not allow any adjusting once a SoundID profile has been created. Sound ID must be turned off if you want to adjust the equalizer, or make any changes. SoundID also doesn’t give any visual representation as to how the audio was tweaked. I would have appreciated being able to see how the equalizer was adjusted based on my preferences during the audio test. I believe that the comfort and sound quality justify the price, however there are a few downsides. I don’t like the stiff rubber microphone (which cannot be removed). While it generally bends to my desired shape, when I flip the mic upwards to mute it - the mic hits my glasses or rests awkwardly against my forehead. I also don’t like that the cable cannot be removed from the headset. A fixed cable is not uncommon, but if it breaks or frays - there is no way to replace the cord and the whole headset becomes useless. I would happily recommend this headset for use with a PC.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using the Corsair HS65 gaming headset for the last 5 days and they’ve been very comfortable and sound great. They get pretty loud and voices come through very loud and clear. I find myself having to adjust the voice chat volume sometimes because one of my friends is very loud. I use them connected straight to a headphone Jack about 90% of the time because they sound fine in stereo mode. It comes with a usb dongle that (in my experience) only works on windows PC’s for surround sound. I tried adapting it to my MacBook and MacOS didn’t recognize it. With a windows PC it is plug and play and will work with Corsair software so you can have and tweak surround sound settings. But honestly, they sound great even in the old fashioned stereo mode when connected with the headphone input. Directional sound still works pretty good. Especially if you have your games set up for stereo and directional audio. Bass on this headset isn’t overwhelming but explosions and gunfire still sound exciting. NPC voices also come through nice and clear. This headset is so well tuned that it sounds like you have a whole speaker setup in the cans. Bass, mids, trebles, vocals all sound very loud and clear. When I game, I usually sit for about 3 to 4 hours at a time. This headset is so comfortable that even after my long gaming sessions, my ears never fatigued or hurt. They are one of the most comfortable gaming headsets I have ever used. Microphone quality is also excellent, my friends all said I sounded loud and clear. I love the flip up to mute function. Makes muting your microphone quick and convenient. The included usb dongle makes plugging into a PC usb quick and easy. I personally don’t like to run an additional audio software in the background because I just want to jump right into a game and go but the feature is a nice bonus and will improve your sound experience. Would I recommend this headset? Yes, most definitely. It is compatible with every game console you may own, as well as PC. They sound fantastic and are comfortable for long gaming sessions. The audio and microphone quality is so good on these that I would even recommend these for those who want to podcast or livestream on a budget.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I enjoyed using it on my PC. I can hear clear and it does block noise from outside. On my ears its felt comfortable that is good as i play games long times.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing sound, great noise canceling and the mic feature is great', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Corsair has been releasing headsets for sometime, with many of their greatest versions being wireless. However, if you’re in the market for a wired headset (3.5mm or USB), you’re in luck! No need to worry about batteries to charge, all while being comfortable for longer gaming sessions. In the box you’ll find the headset with an attached 3.5mm cable, a USB adapter, and some warranty information. Since this has a 3.5mm connector, the headset will also plug into the headset jack of your PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch for audio and chat use. It’s important to note that while you can just use the 3.5mm jack, you will not be able to take advantage of the 7.1 surround sound (Dolby Audio) using the iCue software installed on your PC. There is a simple volume control on the left earphone, and the attached microphone is posable to allow for some preference on positioning. To mute the headset, simply lift the microphone upward until you hear a click. The audio quality is really clear with this headset, and with the iCue software you can further define you audio listening preference using a series of listening examples provided by the software. I should note, that if you have “Dolby Access” installed and licensed for use, you can turn on the Dolby option in Spatial Audio settings on your Windows 11 PC. The iCue software is also not necessarily required for use with the headset jack or the included USB adapter, but will allow for switching Dolby Audio for the 7.1 surround sound option in the app. The microphone input was also clear during my gaming and chat sessions over Discord and while using during video calls. The padding on the earphones and on the head strap are also comfortable, making longer sessions easy, as the headset doesn’t weigh much. The HS65 doesn’t offer any type of RGB lighting found on their more premium models, but none of those cosmetics effect the audio quality of the headset. Overall, the Corsair HS65 offers great quality sound, comfortable wear, and is a great value if you’re using this on multiple devices with a headset jack. The iCue software offers the ability to use 7.1 surround sound with Dolby Audio, but doesn’t break the bank. I’d say this a worthy headset to add to your gaming rotation, while being capable of taking a conference call.']"

I also have a pair of wired Astros that I used previously to these just got tired of the wire and having to take the headphones off when going from room to room as well as just taking controller and headphones with me.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comfortable, great sound and qualiy mic. Prefect for gaming and can definitely be an advantage if using them. Music also sounds great cause of bass and customization using the hyperx app for them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound quality has been incredible. Footsteps are very clear, and audible from a much further distance than my old wired headphones. Game tested on PS5 playing Apex Legends, Overwatch 2 and Rainbow Six Siege. Set up was very easy, just plug the usb receiver in and turn the headphones on. PS5 defaults to output audio through the headphones as soon as you plug the receiver in. You’ll have to switch the audio output each time you’d like to stream audio through the television. The ear cups are comfy, and the noise canceling effect is superb. I find myself gaming for hours fully immersed in the environment of any game I play, without feeling headset fatigue.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Incredible headset. The number one selling point for this headset is the battery life. I seriously go weeks between charges, and I haven't dipped below 60%. Comfort is also outstanding with this headset. The only time that my head starts to fatigue is after a 5+ hour playing session. Overall sound quality is also topnotch. I've also had zero connectivity issues as well."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headset for the money.

The sound quality for one is top notch and I can hear everything perfectly and if I want to I can go into Ngenuity to change sound EQ if I want. The microphone is crisp and clear like all cloud hesdsets I've used. The build quality is also fantastic and comfortable so I will rank it as the most comfortable heqdset I've used. Lastly, the most incredible thing about this headset is the battery life and they are not misleading when HyperX says 300 hours. It is great to not worry about plugging it in and being free without a cord to hold you down. Overall great headset and reccomend to anyone!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I think the hylerx cloud alpha wireless is all you need really and with the mic quality and the sound from the headset is really good in my opinion and i can forget the 300 hours of battery life is jus crazy good if you were to ask me if you should get it you should', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headset for gaming and a longevity filled microphone very sturdy and lots of quality to this microphone I use it mostly for first person shooter games.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Have owned for around 8 months now and absolutely love this headset. Battery life truly is insane, I can walk around the majority of my house without losing connection (~1,100 sq ft house, including basement) and the audio is as good as I (a non-audiophile for those that would care) could ask for. I can't speak to the quality of the mic as I use an elgato wave 3 mic, but that's about the only thing I can mention. OH! I've not noticed (heavy emphasis on noticed) an issues with the software for this either! Often times the necessary software is what takes even a good product and makes it terrible (I'm looking at you, Razer) but I've not noticed any issues here!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ive had the steelseries 9s, most turtle beach headphones and many more overpriced headphones for xbox/PC. I bought these to use strictly for PC and they way outperform my 300+ dollar steeseries. The bass is ridiculous. Mids and highs are crisp and clean. The mic has great sound quality. Bluetooth has a strong connection that can reach across multiple rooms. Mic disconnects so these can be used anywhere. I charge these maybe every 4-5 days because the battery lasts so long. Couldnt say enough good things about these headphones. I use them for gaming and even for my music studio when im not mixing. Definitely worth the price. I recommend them to all of my friends.']"

I even sometimes just turn them on for the noise cancellation feature and don’t play anything. The sound quality is really nice especially in noise canceling mode. I’ve noticed if I have them out of noise canceling mode but a loud noise goes off near me or I yell it kicks noise canceling on which is cool. They fit nice on my head and don’t really hurt after extended use. The battery last a really long time I’ve only had to charge them maybe twice. I like the white color and it isn’t hard to keep clean. They came with a nice case so they are easy to carry around places. They also connect to 2 devices at once so I can easily be watching a video on my computer and pick up my phone and the audio switches to that.

The app was easy to install and connect the headset. There are 4 different color modes you can change to. One gripe I had was that in audio color mode it didn’t always follow the music/sound and wouldn’t light up. The sound quality is impressive and there are quite a few different modes in the app for that as well. These are wireless and have a mic, I dabble in online gaming but more so used these for work calls and each time I had clear connection and no lag. I really love that you can connect these to your phone, this way I can watch videos or music without disturbing anyone else. They are probably one of the most comfortable pairs I’ve tried on.

I am not sure why they are “glitchy” but that seems to be what they are. She can’t use them anymore and was really only able to for two weeks.

Definitely should have adjusted the ear bud size (which does come in the pack) but we tried these for the first time in the car.

These are for kids ages 7 years and older. My son is 8, and even with his sensory issues he's doing great with these! He really seems to like them, and actually leaves them in. They're very comfortable when wearing, and fit his ears perfectly! These came with 4 different earbud tips that can be changed out to fit better. There is an XXS, XS, S, M, L size tips that are designed for smaller ears. One thing I really like with these is, they prevent loudness over 85dB for a safe listening experience. Next, pairing these was very easy! They paired to his tablet and TV within seconds of turning on the Bluetooth. He can control several features from the earbuds. To turn the volume up use the right one, down use the left. Play/pause can be controlled by either earbud. Skip forward, tap the right one 3 times, backwards, tap the left 3 times. To answer a phone call tap twice on the left, to decline tap twice on the right. Lastly, the battery life is fantastic! These hold up over 24 hours on a full 2 hour charge.

I have a few other Anker products, including small bluetooth speakers, and they work well. I decided to try these earbuds because they also promise to be noise cancelling. I've had them a few days, and they're great so far. Unlike airpods, I don't have to recharge them after about 3-4 hours, and their connectivity is more seamless than other 3rd party bluetooth earbuds I've used. I appreciate the little phone holder in the charging case, and that these come in a colour other than white. Even if you're buying them to pair with other Apple products, the pair fine. They don't have all the features that Apple airpods do, but also don't have the same annoying issues, either. Also big thanks to Best Buy. I got these delivered in less than 24 hours, which was crazy good. I can't say how long these little fellas will ultimately last for, but if they go another 3-4 years then I'll be happy, especially for the price."", 'have been using these for a few weeks. Overall great sound quality for the price paid. would buy again', ""I've found recently that I've been going through many earbuds. I've usually been a Skull Candy guy myself, but I just lost another set. I was thinking about picking up a pair of high-end Sony's because I've heard really good reviews about them. The sound quality, the use of them as well as other things. So on my way to Best Buy, one of my Apple earbuds just died on me. So I was looking around at a few different types of Bud's and the associate introduced me to the Soundcore. And I was surprised at the sound quality given their price. Nice clear sound,long lasting battery and they are pretty easy to use. The only thing I'm disappointed about is the noise from outside. The outside sound cancelling really isn't the best unless you're going for a walk down a quiet street. Other than that, for what they cost you really can't complain. I'd gladly recommend these to my friends."", 'I recently purchased the Anker P30i TWS Earpods from Best Buy Windsor, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase! These earbuds deliver exceptional sound quality with deep bass and clear highs, making them perfect for both music and calls, specially when paired with the app. The battery life is impressive, lasting more than 8 hours on a single charge, and the charging case provides additional charges, ensuring I never run out of power. The Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity is seamless and reliable, with no dropouts or delays. I also love how comfortable they are to wear—even during long listening sessions. The noise isolation feature works remarkably well, blocking out background noise and allowing me to focus. Best Buy Windsor provided excellent customer service, and the staff was very helpful in guiding me through my options. I highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for affordable, high-quality wireless audio!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these as a ""cheap"" replacement to my old Samsung Galaxy Buds that cost twice as much as these do - and these are way better! Everything from the sound quality, microphone, the touch controls, noise canceling, and passive mode are SOOOO much better. I love the built-in phone stand as well, its quite practical! 5/5', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very impressed with these! The mic quality is better than my AirPods! I love that you can use the app to change the EQ and change the noise cancellation settings. They are very cute and portable. Also it doubles as a portable phone stand. Already a big fan!', 'The audio, battery, and noise cancelling is all really good for the price. The only reason I can’t give 5 stars is because the case gets scratched up very quickly from the softest things. Nothing that will make the earphones not work but something to consider.']"
Turtle Beach Stealth Pro RF Wireless Gaming Headset for PlayStation - Black,$299.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-rf-wireless-gaming-headset-for-playstation-black/16923817/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have owned and tested dozens of gaming headsets over the year and I have to say that Turtle Beach has always impressed me, especially this Stealth Pro headset. Everything from the box, to the headset itself is nicely made and the quality is top notch. I tried them on this weeks for hours and I can say that they are very comfortable to wear and do not get hot. When it comes to performance, the audio is very crisp and clear. Connecting the headset was a breeze thanks to the Bluetooth connectivity. All in all, I really like these Stealth Pro and it goes without saying that they get a perfect score from me.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] That phone sound absolutely awesome I think Turtle Beach did a great job building these headphones for the PlayStation 5 and 4 and whatever else you want to listen to anything with as far as laptops it sounds good.! You definitely get your money worth of these headphones and the distance on them is really great You could walk all through your house with them on and you'll never miss a beat or you can hear something as far as movies playing and you'll never miss a word The distance is great on them I can have them on walk out of my house take out my trash and I never lose anything The distance is great on them.

Great to track with and great to get feedback from on call status. So yeah if you want to get your games going and high def get these headphones if you want to listen a great music there it is these headphones are what's up if you want to watch a movie and get all the sound quality the action these are what you need."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Turtle Beach - Stealth Pro Multiplatform wireless, noise cancelling gaming headset for Playstation5 is a great headset for long hours of use and it packs a powerful headset capability along with top of the line noise cancelling features and 2 batteries so you can swap batteries in a matter of seconds and continue your gaming experience. Packaging: the packaging is what you expect from Stealth, very neatly packed and it looks like you are discovering easter eggs with every unfold. the headset comes with the following: - Headset - Base for choosing platform (pc, or playstation) that also works as a bluetooth connector to the console/ pc and a battery charger at the same time. - detachable flexible microphone - nice velvety pouch that am sure no one will use. - a couple USB A to USB C cables - quick start guide. just to clear something up, this headset works with every platform. that includes MAC, PC, Nintendo switch, IOS, Android, PS4, PS5. it has specific capabilities to enhance the experience when using with PS5. Build quality: the build quality for turtle beach keeps getting better and better. I have $500+ Harmon Kardon headsets that barely feel and look as nice as these Turtle Beach headsets. This headset is on the heavy side, but you dont feel the weight when wearing it. the head arc rest is made of metal and covered with flexible plastic and a nice memory foam to keep your scalp comfortable. the ear cups and big and the foam is thick for maximum comfort. this headset also looks really good. it looks and feels very expensive. noise cancelling and volume: I have 1 word only. SUPERIOR. switching between platforms: the wireless charging transmitter that looks like a puck has a button to toggle between PS and PC for maximum compatibility. i loved how the headset volume can be set using the remappable wheel on the left side ear cup and that the battery cover is on the right side ear cup and is held by 3 strong magnets so it clicks securely in place and allows to change battery in a matter of seconds. also the detachable mic clicks in place and cant be inserted the wrong way. Summary: This is a very well thought design that was executed perfectly and it has a very good audio quality and overall features that makes it superior to most headsets in this price range.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Summary: These are quite impressive for primarily gaming, but also for everyday use! Even though they are marketed toward PlayStation, they are very much able to be used with PC, Switch and mobile via USB or Bluetooth. The audio quality is great for games and music, battery life is amazing, and they are comfortable for long wear. Unboxing: The packaging is very high quality. Inside the sturdy box you will find the headphones, the detachable microphone, a carrying case, two USB-A to USB-C cables (for connecting to console/PC and charging), two batteries (one installed, one on the charger/puck), the puck adaptor and documentation. Setup: On PS5, setup couldn’t be simpler. Plug in the puck to one of the available USB ports, ensure it is set to PS, turn on the headphones and wait a few seconds to sync. Depending on your PS5 setup, you might need to dig into audio settings to switch the audio output. On PC, do the same but ensure it is switched to PC which installs a few drivers. There is also software I recommend you download to ensure firmware is fully updated and to map buttons and EQ to your heart’s content (screenshots included). This app also exists on phone which you can connect via Bluetooth. Use: I first tried it with my PS5 since that is what it is marketed toward. I used the front USB-A slot for review purposes but keep in mind the PS5 has two USB-A ports in the back you can use if you want a cleaner set up. As described above, setup is a breeze. I first tried playing with Tetris Connect since there are some amazing music tracks in that game. The Bass is thumping on these 50mm drivers! I also streamed some Spotify music on PS5 while waiting for an update and the music was outstanding. Next, playing some Overwatch 2, I was most impressed by the thump of the shots and explosions and how the headphones also emphasize detailed sounds like footsteps. There is a lot of sound stage on these allowing for a good overall ability to locate where the sound is coming from so that’s a bonus. I mainly had the same thoughts for Destiny 2. I then tried it with PC. My main wow factor came from the Turtle Beach Audio Hub software. I don’t usually customize my settings on mice, keyboard and headphones but the number of settings within this was amazing! Here you will find EQ sounds, Microphone EQ, ANC, Superhuman Hearing (footsteps and such), power settings, levels, button mapping, and firmware updates. Other stuff: I liked that the mic boom is detachable. If you prefer to use your headphones as simply headphones, you can do that, and they look mostly like a normal set of cans without the boom (no crazy lighting). Don’t lose the little plug where the boom goes as it covers up the port. Without the boom, there are still microphones built into the headphones which also for mic communication, the boom just simply makes it better. The included bag is a very snug fit. It does the trick for storage though and even has a little pouch for the boom. I love the batteries! I fell asleep one night during a late “review” session wearing them and they were still playing Spotify music on the PS5 until morning when I woke up. What is super cool here is that you do not need to plug them in to charge them. There is an included 2nd battery in the puck so you can very quickly swap batteries out by pulling off the left outer ear panel and changing them out in seconds, a great feature!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] About three days ago, I finally had the great opportunity of receiving Turtle Beach’s Stealth Pro Wireless Headphones for PlayStation. I going to start off by saying that the most money that I’ve personally ever spent on over-the-ear gaming headphone has only been about $80. However, even though I only got these in for the purpose of a review, the packaging alone makes a strong case for investing in the triple digits as it just says “PREMIUM”!!! They are durable, sleak in design and have quality memory foam padding. But does the actual sound quality scream buy these me for $330? Now, I have a Series X and PS5 but have always leaned towards the former due their implementation of Atmos and DTS:X headphone audio. But this is the first time I skipped the soundbar on my PS5 and actually turned on the 3D audio. While going through the Sound menu, I was admittedly not that impressed. It wasn’t until I tested “Spider-Man: Remastered” with the audio on Maximum Settings that I genuinely heard a distinct difference. Particularly when leaping off tall buildings then pendulum swinging lower into the New York City Traffic. The Stealth Pro’s accurately captured the airy wisp of night while zipping past skyscrapers and then enveloped me as I descended into the chaos of honking horns, police radios, and pedestrian chatter. I then watched “Man of Steel” & “The Greatest Showman” as they are both excellent mixes with very dynamic soundstages in the opening sequences. There was substantial punch in the bass and crystal clear fidelity with higher register sounds. My preferred PlayStation setting under the Game EQ Preset is “Signature Sound” with the “Superhuman Hearing®️” feature on Footstep just below 50%. Make sure that the transmitter is correctly set to (PS) when using your console because I mistakenly had the Headphones set to PC and misinterpreted the audio as muffled. Your settings may vary but it best recommended to keep your PS5 3D Audio settings at Default “3”. I got around 11 hrs play/ listen time out of a 75% charged battery. So I am assuming I could easily get 14 hrs on a full charge. And they were extremely comfortable throughout as the perfectly cup my entire ear without squeezing the sides of my head. That said, the only for these headphones are the Active Noise Cancelling (ANC). While they are competent in suppressing the obnoxious background hums of a fan or an HDD, they are fair poorly against sudden outside ambient noises (I consistently drop my TV remote controls). There are is an option in the Audio Hub app that always to gradually toggle between “Ambient” and “ANC” and even at the highest setting, I couldn’t fully mute outside sounds. I’m unsure if it is a software or hardware issue but nonetheless it is an issue. Overall, The Stealth Pro Wireless Headphones for PlayStation are an otherwise great gaming headphone option. The 3D audio is truly dynamic with spatial audio for gaming that rivals my AirPod Pros, honestly. There are also tons of options in the Audio Hub app to help you hone in on your preferred sound. I would also recommend the Stealth Pro’s for movies as the PlayStation has a 4K Blu-ray player and the Turtle Beach’s 50mm speakers are more than capable of outputting high bit-rate content. Lastly, while not a dealbreaker for people like myself who like to be aware of their surroundings, the ANC could stand to be improved with a possible firmware update. For now, $250 sounds about right. 4.25/5', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My quest for the perfect PS5 gaming headphones is officially over!!!! The search started with the PS4 back in the day but I finally pulled the trigger on a PS5 a couple of months ago and really wanted to have a headset that could really maximize the console. I really had just given up and was using another decent pair of wireless headphones but (as you may know if you are reading this) PS5 isn’t really headphone friendly when it comes to just syncing up with a pair of Bluetooth headphones. I had to either plug in the small sound jack into the controller (ridiculous in this day and age) and run a cable into my headphones or more recently had to plug a usb transmitter into the usb port but then sound volume and audio controls were very limited! I was always having to make sure my headphones were charged and God forbid I forget to turn them off (after a few cold beverages) and then out of juice when it was game time. So when I saw the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro headset and that they were specific for PS5/PS4 and PC I got really excited. They advertised a perfect high end solution to really maximize and enhance the game play of the PS5 which I am absolutely in love with by the way…I digress. Got the Stealth Pro and could not wait to open the box. It is a hard cardboard box and one could use it for storage if one wanted…I haven’t though because I am always using them!!! In the box came the wires to connect the broadcasting puck to the PS5 and a charging cable if needed. It also had a quick start up guide which I did not need…super simple. Pulled the headset out, pulled the puck out and plugged it into the PS5 rear port and made sure the puck was set to “PS” and turned on the headphones and it synced up in a flash!!! The headset is well built, sturdy and very comfortable. It has a little weight to it but well balanced and feels light on my head. I have worn them for over 2 hours in one setting and forgot they were on my head… That says a lot. The ear pads cup over my whole ear and the top band is very cushy! They don’t slide or move and are easy to adjust. I mentioned that it had a little weight and that’s from the premium components from the cups to the headrail, I think which is well worth the trade off. I have had “super light” headphones only to be frustrated by the ambient sound coming in and the ease of movement of the headphones from basic head gestures. The Stealth pros go on and I am immersed and comfortable and again…just forget they are on my head which is meant as a very solid compliment. Turn on the active noise canceling and I am transported to battlefield or where ever my games take me! The ANC is top notch. Really allows for the premium sound to shine!! The detachable mic is genius and clicks in to place perfectly and securely. It feels like it was a connected piece of equipment from the factory but it is easily removable and with the mic cover back on after you take the mic off, the Stealth Pro transforms back into a sleek high end headphones! I had a great time switching between my PS5, Ipad, Iphone and back to test all the sound from all the devices. Just top tier stuff!!!! That’s another amazing thing about these headphones…. The way they were designed. For gamers by gamers….I mean a switchable battery that swaps out in seconds from the Base station puck!!!! I mean it’s brilliant!!! I WILL NEVER NOT BE READY TO GAME with these headphones…. I don’t have to worry about plugging them in ect and when I travel and want to just use the headphones for music…no problem , the Bluetooth syncs in seconds with whatever I am using and I can just plug the cable into the headphones to charge where ever…puck not required. Speaking of traveling… they even provide a really nice soft carrying case which I thought was a nice touch. The mic sounds great but I wish the sound monitoring on the mic through the earphones was a little louder. I need to hear my quick whips and smack talking during multiplayer games and the GG when done. You can adjust the volume manually or through the app while you are actually playing a game on your ps5…which is pretty cool. While playing COD I can open the app on my phone and adjust the superhuman hearing footsteps ect but even at full mic monitoring through the earphones it was pretty soft. You can adjust all the settings by mapping the buttons on the headphones but I like using the app…it’s just easier. I also liked how I could adjust the level of ANC. The headphones also have built in mics if you don’t have the mic connected. The Active noise canceling is really good but the superhuman hearing they advertise sounds like just an increased treble sound profile. I didn’t find it particularly helpful during game play. I am hesitant to knock it really though because I feel like that is more of a player preference and how much can a sound device do to only amplify foot steps and distant gun chatter in a FPS. My absolute biggest LOVE about these head sets is the volume wheel on the side of the right ear… While playing a game on my PS5….I can… Actually volume up and down with a simple quick spin of the dial….Sounds like a simple thing to do but if you have a PS4 or PS5 you know the struggle is real to get it to turn up high enough or to make any sound adjustments while actually playing. This is such a game changer for me and what really makes this a huge winner for me. Plus when streaming shows through my PS5 I can raise and lower tech volume with the wheel!!! GAME CHANGER!!! I guess I should mention the over all sound as well…It is solid and has great bass and mid’s and highs. It’s in line with what I would expect for a high end pair of headphones. Sounds amazing! Overall, I don’t think one could buy a better set of headphones for gaming. I own 5 pairs of over the ear high end headphones and these are the best I have played with to date. All the boxes are checked for me with the Stealth Pro from swapable batteries, Detachable mic that feels like it’s actually built with the mic attached, Lighting fast Bluetooth with zero lag, super comfortable with no motion movement, ANC, a really well built and functional app, phone calls, superb sound….It’s a WINNER!!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'m going to try my best to keep this short and simple. But I’ll probably fail as there is just so much to get through. As this headset is bit more tumultuous than I would have liked. SOUND QUALITY: Turtle Beach isn\'t known for their sound quality. I think they\'ve always had great ability to EQ but the sound itself has never been spectacular. This has now changed with this headset. As it is THE BEST sounding headset I\'ve ever tried. Beathing the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless by a noticeable margin. Bass, highs, mids, directional quality, soundstage, are all excellent. I\'ve gone from using multiple headsets/headphones to just this one for both my gaming and media watching. It does a great job at both of those. Music it also does well on but not quite as good. I also have audiophile headphones (Sennheiser HD650 and Hifiman Ananda) which are better at music. A really close match for media consumption (movies/tv/videos on internet). But these are much better for gaming. Truly blown away at the sound quality and would give them a 9.5/10. And I tend to be highly picky about this. COMFORT: Excellent. Pads are super plush and comfortable. They have active noise cancelling (ANC) which means there is microphone inside the earcup which I can\'t feel on my ears. They do create a dramatic seal and can get warm due to that. Also, my situation awareness (without ANC on) is not good as it dramatically cuts down on noise (which can be a good or bad thing depending) where I can\'t hear what is going on around my house even if nothing is playing. But can easily wear them all day long (8 or more hours) without any issues. MIC QUALITY: Flip to mute is really nice. You can also hold one of the buttons to turn on/off mute. It has two microphones. The first being your usual microphone. The second being the microphone that help with the ANC which can also be used to talk. The dedicated microphone sound great and better than most of the competition. But not as good as the Corsair HS80 which I think has the best sounding microphone in any headset. Without the dedicated mic it sounds good too. But you pick up a lot of background noise as well. So if you aren’t in a quiet environment that will be highly annoying to whoever you are talking too. THE APP: Is excellent works well, straight forward, lots of options. EQ is excellent (even though I didn\'t have to change anything as stock it was fantastic for me). As headset apps go probably my favorite. Which has always been the case for me and Turtle Beach. BATTERY LIFE: It comes with two batteries. They last long enough to use for a whole day of gaming but compared to the competition are on the very low end overall. However, since it comes with two of them you just swap it out and you are good to go. Making that a non-issue. I love this idea and hope others continue to follow suit. You can also charge it via USB-C. Overall, no real complaints here. When you turn on the headset it will say your battery level. Also, when low will start to beep. TURNING IT ON: Normally I don’t discuss this. But to get the headset to start to play sound is seriously like 30 seconds. It’s crazy. You press the power button for 2 seconds, it pauses for a few seconds, then powers on, then you wait for it to connect (which is seriously like 10 seconds) then it will say the battery level and connected at which point you can hear audio but it gets overblown by the female voice talking and then you are good to go. My Arctis Nova Pro Wireless take like 2 – 5 seconds. The same goes for Bluetooth here. When I am watching it via Bluetooth (even with standby turn off not activated) it will sometimes just turn off while I’m listening to something causing me to have to go through the long arduous process. The volume wheel is also highly inaccurate. You spin it forever to make any type of change (that is me being a bit dramatic, but it isn’t very sensitive). BUILD QUALITY: Build quality is meh. It\'s not bad but for the price and in comparison to other headsets in the same price tier they feel cheap. Both outer edges have a plastic shell which feel cheap. As one side pops off to give you access to the battery (which feels solid) but the other side is a giant volume wheel that feels very cheap. Inside that volume wheel you also have another button which feels cheap. Then under that you have your other buttons which feel cheap. Then you do have metal on the outside which feels quality and robust. The earcups themselves are also very plush and comfortable and are excellent. However, you can hear the drivers inside crinkling when moving or putting on the headset which worries me long term. Headband adjustment and movement is solid/great. Very smooth and holds it place. But the headband itself feels mostly plasic and the rubber/padding kind of starts coming off when you pull it out fully so if you have an extra large head I’d be a bit worried. I do not trust it at all to try and twist them like I can do with other headsets. Microphone is solid. Buttons feel cheap and I highly dislike them. Also, in a terrible position making them hard to know which one you are pressing. Additionally, makes crinkling of drivers everytime you press them as well. Overall build quality (in terms of other similar priced items) is a 5/10. They cheapest feeling by far ""premium"" headset I\'ve tried. But overall I think is probably like a 6.5/10. All this to say I think the build quality in reality is very good and I think they would be very hard to break. But the FEEL cheap. There is a difference in how something feels and how something actually is. ANC: Is terrible. I don\'t know what people are saying on how it is good. They are nowhere near AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, Bose QC35, etc. Similar to more of a budget ANC option. Where mostly it changes the pitch of a sound over reducing/canceling it out. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro do it better and those don\'t have good ANC either. The majority of the noise cancelling is done PASSIVELY through the earcup design (as these are a closed back headset, with rubber earpads, that seal extremely well) and is like 95% of it. Honestly, I wish they would stop putting them in the headset as paying extra for something that works poorly is a shame. However, having some hear through (which is also meh) can be beneficial since these do have such good passive noise isolation. CONCLUSION: I bought these fully expecting (and wanting) to return them. As I already have plenty of great headsets and didn’t need another one. However, they absolutely knocked it out of the park for sound quality and comfort and have now become my new main headset that I use for everything (other than music since I have very expensive headphones for that). In fact the sound quality, comfort, microphone quality, wireless, and battery life are all so good I\'m not even interested in looking at another headset. I really enjoy them. However, they aren’t perfect as pretty much everything else is “fine/meh”. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless look better, feel dramatically higher quality, have much better controls, and holistically are better. But these sound better and are more comfortable. So, if sound isn’t your number 1 priority (which it is for me) then you may want to look at the other top of the line options from SteelSeries or Audeze. As I was hoping for a bit better quality overall at this price point. If they were to have better controls that were more intuitive and felt better like the Nova Pro Wireless (which would also make their build quality feel much better), and faster pairing, I think they’d be nearly unbeatable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So, I\'ve really been on a headset kick here lately and am starting to amass a bit of a collection! However, of all the brands I own, Turtle Beach is one of the two or three that I truly enjoy. I loved my Stealth 700\'s, but I was SUPER disappointed in their Stealth 700 Max model - they didn\'t get anywhere near as loud as the regular 700\'s and I\'ve since been using other brands to find my niche. Will these Stealth Pro\'s bring me back to Turtle Beach as my daily driver? Let\'s find out. As for unboxing, it\'s pretty premium feeling! Inside, you\'ll find your headphones themselves (which just upon looking at them and taking them out, I was surprised at how nice they felt!), two USB cables (one longer...about 6\', one shorter...about 3\'), your base receiver that plugs into your system and acts like a hub that also charges your spare battery, two batteries (one pre-installed in the headset and the other, going into the base) and finally, your microphone, as well as a travel bag that everything can go in. I do love how the travel bag has individual pockets inside that when used, keeps everything from rubbing together and causing scratches. So, all in all, everything feels pretty great. The only ""cheap"" feeling during the unboxing that I had was with the batteries themselves. On the extra battery that goes into the hub to charge (not the pre-installed one), after peeling off the film, there were a bunch of scratches on top of the battery, which I noticed immediately. The batteries are really light-weight, which is a good thing, but this also makes them feel pretty cheap, especially given the plastic housing material. They are easy to get in and out of both the base and the headset, so that\'s not an issue. I just wish they were a little bit more durable feeling. Ok, now - initial setup. ANY time I get a new headset, the first thing I do is immediately install the dedicated program on my laptop (if I don\'t have it already) so I can update the firmware - In this case, there\'s a new version of the Turtle Beach Audio Hub (V2) that I needed to install. I installed that and plugged both the base and the headset into my laptop using the two included USB cables. The Audio Hub V2 app would not recognize my devices for some reason...even after multiple attempts. Thankfully, after 15 minutes of trying and giving up, a system reboot solved that problem and they were detected immediately afterwards. And oddly (this may be a first!), there was actually no new firmware update available. I immediately thought...this is either a good thing or a bad thing, lol - good being that they were actually READY for release and all the initial bugs are ironed out....or bad being that these were going to be a buggy mess... The verdict? GOOD! Thus far, outside of the initial detection issue I had with the Audio Hub app, I\'ve experienced ZERO other issues with these cans! I\'m going to say that these are probably the closest ""ready to release"" headphones that I\'ve had in a long time that didn\'t require a firmware update off the bat and I didn\'t experience any bugs! So, great job here, Turtle Beach! Alright, setup time. I never could determine if they intended the longer or the shorter cable to be the one that plugs into the system, directly. I guess that\'s going to depend on if you\'re using it on PC or PS5 and where you plan on placing the receiver base. I used the longer cable going from the receiver into the back of the system, because I have it on the shelf above my system itself, and then the shorter cable as the spare for charging, etc. I had no issues with the PS5 detecting the headset or pairing it to the receiver base. Also, which may be another first, I had no problems pairing the headset to my phone via Bluetooth! And the Bluetooth here is simultaneous, meaning, you can listen to music from your phone or take a call, while still hearing your game audio and such, which I love. The Audio Hub app for the iPhone (using an iPhone 14 Pro Max) is pretty great, although I wish it would detect the connection automatically instead of me having to tap the ""get connected"" button every time I go into it. From the app, you can see where the master volume level is at, change your equalizers for the headphone (gaming) and even Bluetooth, separately! This is awesome! They\'ve really thought of everything here. Now, on to functionality, mic and audio quality. This will be split into several sub-sections: 1) Let me start out by saying that man, are these things comfortable! The build quality is fantastic and I have no worries over long-term issues, just yet. The cushions are super plush memory foam and they fit great for what I\'d image would be all head sizes. These are probably the 2nd best ""stock"" cushions I\'ve experienced on a new headset. 2) The microphone is great! It\'s a flip-to-mute, which is fantastic and I love the little touch where the blue ring around the receiver changes to red to indicate it is indeed muted. The built-in microphone is ...OK... I\'d definitely prefer just keeping the microphone itself attached, since I can keep it up and muted when not using it, given the big increase to mic quality this way. 3) I do wish there was a way to either dim or turn off the blue ring (just keep the red mic mute ring option there) on the receiver hub, as it\'s a bit annoying and distracting, having that on ALL THE TIME. Perhaps they can implement this in a future firmware update as maybe a toggle within the phone app or something? 4) As for audio quality itself, these have 50mm ""Nanoclear"" drivers, which seem a step above the norm, as most headphones these days still use 40mm drivers, unless you\'re dealing with Planar Magnetic, which are usually much bigger (and louder)...around 90mm. So, these seem to be a pretty happy middle-ground. I played a variety of games with these cans: Hogwarts Legacy, Modern Warfare II (MP and Warzone), Resident Evil 4, Destiny 2, Dredge, Diablo II Resurrected and Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. I will say that the sound across all games was pretty consistent. Some headphones seemed to vary pretty wildly...some games were overly loud and others were overly low. So, I was happy about the consistency and the overall sound-stage seems wide. Also, the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) wasn\'t too overdone. While, it doesn\'t seem as strong as some other gaming and non-gaming headphones I\'ve used, it does it\'s job pretty well. However, I did seem to notice a bit of an audio difference (very small) when using ANC compared to having ANC off. I prefer ANC off, as it tended to sound a bit better and more ""full"". 5) However...I\'m a little underwhelmed by the max volume levels, which sadly, seem to be pretty common for PS5 headphones. These have almost NO volume until you get past the 50-60% mark, leaving not a whole lot of volume overhead. In order to get the volume to my ""normal"" comfortable listening levels of my other headphones, I have to get them to about 85% on the volume slider within the app. So, this means that I can\'t really ""jam out"" with them when I want because the total volume overhead just isn\'t there. This could be fixed in a firmware update, but judging by Turtle Beaches track record with this, I\'m not banking on this happening - it seems to be pretty common for their headphones. 6) Overall volume levels aside, the only other real complaint I have with these headphones is the actual volume wheel, itself. It just feels cheap. With the app up, so I can see at what point it\'s being adjusted to the next increment, it seems that you have to turn the wheel pretty far to get that next level. Without using the app, it\'s a guessing game as to if it\'s actually turning up the volume or if you need to turn the wheel more. I also did notice that there is a bit of a small delay (by a few seconds, it seems) in making adjustments on the headset - including volume - and when it shows in the app. So, in summary, I\'m overall pretty impressed with these headphones. I\'m not 100% sure just yet if they\'re going to be my daily driver, as my others get louder than these do. Regardless, if these were to be a secondary pair, I\'m totally happy with that, too! These cans are packing all of the latest and greatest feature for the price point they\'re asking - you can\'t go wrong! The only downsides I can find is the ""cheap"" feeling of the batteries themselves and the volume wheel, as well as the inability to turn off the always-on ring around the received. If Turtle Beach could just increase the total volume by about 20-25%, I would have no issues saying that these are my new favorite cans. With the above being said, I personally give these a 4.5 out of 5. But, since we can\'t do half stars here, I\'m going to go with a 5 and give the benefit of doubt, here. Just note that if the volume levels can be improved, I\'ll give these a 5, all the way, no questions asked.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Turtle Beach Steal Pro had a quick setup. After unboxing, connect the transmitter/battery charger to the PS5. Then, connect the microphone to the headset and you are ready to go. --- FEATURES --- Dual mics (boom and no boom options), Bluetooth 5.1 dual connectivity (plugs to phone and console), customizable via the phone/PC app, active noise canceling (ANC), swappable dual battery system (with second battery included). --- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS --- It had been a while since a gaming headset stood out above the crowd. This PS5 headset really is a great package for the price. To start off, active noise canceling can be a very important feature in a gaming headset, especially if you enjoy online competitive games. What ANC does, is it reduces your real-world ambient sound. So, people speaking in your home or outdoor neighbors won’t be a distraction anymore. The headset has two microphones. One is the boom mic that is adjustable and can quickly be muted by flipping it up. The other is hidden in the headphones and allows you to use it when the boom mic isn’t plugged in. This feature is great if you want to use the headset like headphones while you are away from your console, allowing you to take incoming calls from your phone. If you plan on traveling with it, the included traveling pouch is a great option to protect your headphones while on the go. They can also be charged with the extra USB-C cable included, which can be stored in the pouch. Speaking on incoming calls, you can connect your phone via bluetooth. This feature is great, especially if you plan on using ANC, as you could miss a call or text otherwise. I really enjoyed hearing my friends when they sent me audio texts and I could easily reply back using the mic from the headset. I also was able to play my own playlist from my phone while I played less taxing games such as Minecraft or tower defense games. The button called Superhuman Hearing is helpful when you want to hear footsteps of enemies. This is a great mode to try when playing games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, or other games that require stealth. I enjoyed it while playing The Last of Us 2, as that game requires silence and precision. This headset uses a removable, rechargeable battery pack system. What I found most impressive is that one battery can last you up to 12 hours and the box includes 2 batteries for you! So, if you use up one battery, the fun can continue as you install the fully charged one and allow the drained one to continue charging in the transmitter/battery charger that is included. --- APPROVAL --- This is one headset package that was very well thought out with the gamer in mind. This is already a professional level headset that is a welcoming addition to any PS5/Nintendo Switch/PC gamer.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] it’s been awhile since I own another turtle beach headset, and their latest Stealth Pro is Wow. the company has improve, first of all i’m loving the look of this new stealth pro, grey black and aluminum. it looks professional that doesn’t look like a hardcore gaming headset. high end gaming headset is what I mainly use, this having the ability to connect your phone while connected to your gaming system is another great feature, i’ve seen other headsets offer this and i’m glad turtle beach included with stealth pro. the comfortably of the headset was great, a good amount of support, been using it for couple of days now and so far no issues with comfort when wearing this headset. audio clarity of the headset was also good, it’s loud but even if you have it on max volume it doesn’t feel like you need to remove the headset for being too loud. highly recommend installing the app either on your phone, because it just gives the user so much more option to customize how much treble, bass and vocals. other gaming headset should follow through of what is turtle beach is doing with including a reliable app, once making an adjustment through the app it transfers right away on your headset. I love how I can use this headrest with my nintendo which, PC, and connecting to my phone, so this headset doesn’t have to stay with my PS5, this will be my alternative travel headset from now on. having active noise cancel is my favorite, I hate getting bothered while gaming when my wife keeps calling my name, you also have the ability to adjust this setting through the app. back to the app, having the pc version of the app is also a great addition to this headset, it does offer a whole lot more settings compared to the mobile app. one of the coolest thing about this headset package that it comes with extra battery right at the box, yeah it’s insane, you will never run out of game time with this headset. the headset itself also already equipped with one battery. then a second battery waiting for you on the doc. and if you don’t want to change the battery you can even just plug in the usb c directly to the headset. few things that I notice that I did not like, but audio on calls seems muffled a bit. not sure if I just have to make adjustments through the app, but I feel like I should have to deal with that when buying a premium headset. I also wish they found a way to transfer the detachable microphone on the other side, not an issue but if you want to change the battery you’ll have to disconnect the microphone as well. my experience with this headset has been great. I forgot to mention that I like the superhuman settings it offer incase you play a ton of competitive games you can set where you can hear foot step a lot better, overall experience on that it does seems to work quite well. turtle beach your guys did an amazing job on this new stealth pro. I highly recommend this if you guys want a great sounding gaming headset that can also be use on the go.']"
Skullcandy Riff 2 Wireless On-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - True Black,$49.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/skullcandy-riff-2-wireless-on-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-true-black/16006903/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really love these headphones. The ear pads are soft and comfortable over my ears which is crucial. The sound is great. I listened to dubstep/edm and it sounds awesome. Nice bass. I also used them while watching streaming shows and it sounded great as well. There is also a companion app you can download which lets you use an equalizer and shows you the battery percentage of your headphones. The only negative about them maybe is that they feel like they’re made of cheap plastic and feel super light so it makes you think that they’re cheap. It’s not a big deal, but it may bother some people. I’m happy with them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound! Great clarity! Great comfortable fit! My husband is completely obsessed with these headphones! Extremely easy to pair with any bluetooth! He wears them every single day all day at work! He refuses to wear any other headphones but these! Cool packaging! Awesome color! Highly highly highly recommended!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The riff 2 headphones are fast charging and super clear sound. I love this headphones and to can talk to the phone and listen to music. The batteries last a good bit of use. I would said yall definitely need these headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset has great sound output! Loud with a bit of bass feel to it. Connecting the headset to your phone (via Bluetooth) was seamless. Beside listening to music, I was able to use the headset to take a call. Wife stated that she could hear me clearly when I am speaking. You can unlock additional features by downloading the Skullcandy app. With the app you can check current battery status, set preset equalizer or you can customize the equalizer to your personal needs. Other unique features about this headset is that it can pair it to 2 devices (Phone & Laptop) at a time. It also has “Tile” technology built in. If you misplaced this headphone, you could locate it by using the Tile app on your phone. The headset will play a pinging sound to help you located it. Overall, this is a great headset. I have only 1 complaint. The part where you extend the ears, there’s a sharp edge on each side that pushes against my head, and it starts to hurt after wearing the headset for a while. Not sure if anyone else is having this issue. Personally, I think this is a poor design and that they should have kept the frame evenly all the way around or they should have placed padding between the slopes. Other than this issue, the headset is fantastic!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was tired of being tethered to my computer while working, so I was in the market for some wireless headphones, so when I had the chance to pick up a set of Skullcandy Riff 2 there was no hesitation. So far they have been reliable, hold a good charge, are comfortable, and produce rich, full sound. The headphones came well packaged and in perfect condition. They even came with a charge so I could immediately connect them through Bluetooth to my computer and listen immediately. Connecting them was a breeze…holding the center button down put them in pairing mode, and my computer recognized them without issue. Too, they come with both a charging cable, and a traditional cord to use them as a wired headset. They are a bit on the small size (I’ve included a picture with a dollar bill for size context), I would say, but my husband uses them too without issue, especially because the ear ups are very padded and quite comfortable. They telescope outward to account for different head shapes, and comfortably satisfy everyone in my family. The sound they produce is rich and full, and I haven’t noticed any lag when watching video on my computer. They sound good throughout the range, from bass to treble. Too, the sound is clear, and easy to pick up voices. Because this is my first pair from Skullcandy, I’m not sure how they will hold up, but I have every reason to believe they are well crafted. They hold their charge well, and have kept their shape. I’m very happy with the Riff 2 and certainly recommend them for those that want a light comfortable way to go wirelessly.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These wireless headphones by skullcandy are really nice. You can hear the music clearly and hear all the details in the song. They do not take long to charge and it last throughout the day. They feel comfortable sitting on your ears and comes with a cord and charger. Only thing that is a downgrade is the size of the charger, I wish it was longer.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have never really been a fan of the Bluetooth earbuds, that are popular at the moment, because they aren't comfortable in my ears and I am always fearful of them falling out and getting lost. However, I do love the cord free convenience of them. These headphones provide the cord free experience without the discomfort of having to place something in your ear or the fear of losing an expensive item. With the plush padding, they sit very comfortably on the ears so wearing them for an extended period is no problem at all. They also extend to provide different fits. The power button and volume up and down switch is located on the ear piece and they paired instantly with my Chromebook when I turned them on so that is a definite plus. The battery life between charges is also really great. All in all, this truly is a great product and I would definitely recommend them to just about anyone. This would make a great little gift as well, if you are looking for something useful to make someone smile."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Skullcandy Riff 2 On-ear headphones are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. The ear pads are super soft, and squishy. The Bluetooth v5.2 technology with Multipoint Pairing can sync up to two devices. I have them paired with my phone, and my probook. I'm able to switch back and forth between the two seamlessly. The sound quality is also quite good in my opinion. The battery lasts a very long time and, comes with super convenient backup aux cable! They also have Tile brand finding tech, making it easy to find them if I misplace them. I love and recommend these headphones! My husband and I have to compromise on who is going to use them each day."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound quality for music and noise cancelling is top notch. I took away one star because I also use my headphones for talking on the phone alot and these are no good for that. I love these for a relaxed vibe, just listening to music blocking out the world. The length of the headband is great because they fit over my big hair. I am still amazed by this lol. However, my most favorite feature of all are the ear cushions!!! Soooo soft. I have been using these for over a month now and they are still soft and hold its shape. Also I get about 3 work shifts out of these before having to charge, superb. Definitely recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Lightweight, on the smaller side. Great sound. They don't die fast. Charge like every 3 days.""]"

I’ve used JVC for many years and will still continue to do so. The only flaw and the reason I didn’t give 5 stars on this review is because the cord is a little short. I guess I’m used to the $20 black or blue pair that have the 3m cord. This one I cannot put my phone in my pocket and use headphones because it isn’t long enough and it pulls them out of my ear. Working out, I can’t run it through my shirt because of the short cord and if I don’t it gets wrapped in the machines or workout equipment I’m using. Overall, they have great sound quality and are very easy on your ears. Mine are sensitive and these are the only ones I can use.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are my favorite.

Theres absolutely no delay in sound like there was with other bluetooth headphones. Having the dongle is great as it prevents the sound delay and also allows other usb-c components to be ised anytime. The case os sleek and well designed, the earbuds hold a decent charge and the dongle is functional and descreet. Not much more you could ask for. Nailed it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They sound great, could even almost replace my airpod pros. When paired via bluetooth with my phone while being plugged into my Quest 2 I had it switch back and forth a couple on times. It stopped when when I did either one of two things, when I unplugged my elite strap with battery, and/or when I “forgot device” on my iphone. Which is fine honestly, I don’t really need my phone connected because I have my airpods and don’t generally take calls while playing games. My only gripe is that when my elite strap battery is plugged through the dongle, I can’t see the battery % of the strap battery. It still charges just doesn’t feel like the batteries are “talking” to each other anymore, that is because the passthrough can pass charge but not data. For most people who just have a standard strap or elite strap without battery, these are awesome and I highly recommend. I still recommend for those with the elite strap with battery but just know there will be some minor compromises. Also it works great for computers and really anything with usb-c, just plug it in and your set to go. Plugged it into my laptop and immediately started working, no drivers, no menus to go through, just worked.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My cat knocked these over and chewed one of them almost in half. With a little super glue I was able to put it back together and have been using them ever since. 10/10 for repairability. I have been using these almost daily since I received them in December 2022. I originally ordered them so that I could play in the Quest, the noise isolation is amazing and sound quality is as good as any in it's price range. These really shine when using them to game on PC or just as a travel headset compatible with any USBC no Bluetooth needed. They are super low latency so great for competitive games and perfect for WFH applications as well."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are some of my most favorite earbuds/headphones I've ever used. They are excellent from everything to calls, music, or gaming. The ability to use the included USB C adapter as a charge pass through is just the icing on the cake. These are cheaper than my Samsung Galaxy buds 2 but they are so much better in my opinion. I also really enjoy the case and lighting."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bro..... Sis....Yes! I got this for Oculus 3 and it totally lived up to the hype. Now I use it for all my gaming sessions and streaming. You can even play games while getting notifications and doing stuff on your phone. It's a must-have, trust me, you won't regret it. Plus, it comes with these sick RGB lights that give it a cool retro gamer vibe."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was a bit hesitant about buying these earbuds for my PS5 and Nintendo Switch, But, I was wrong as I decided to give it a try and see how they turn out. The truth is these earbuds blew me away. They sound clear and the connection is reliable via USB-C dongle and BT. Quality is outstanding and the designed place to store the dongle is well-thought-out. To be fair, they don't sound like any regular headset but as earbuds and the freedom of using either side at a time is a big win. Also, I was able to receive phone calls while gaming and connected via the dongle, it lowers the gaming sound and increases the voice quality for phone calls which is amazing. The price is very competitive and can't be beaten!!!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great project I bought 200-dollar Sony earbuds, wound up returning them, and kept these. The sound and convenience of the product are well worth the price. I definitely recommend this.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like these earbuds! They connect to all my devices with bluetooth and with the usb dongle, making it very versatile with every device. They also fit great in my ear and I appreciate the many earbud sizes. Sound quality wise, it can be a bit quiet generally with the max volume a little low, but also pretty solid. The mic is a bit quiet and the sound can be heard being crackly, so I do wish the mic quality was better. Battery life is also lower than I thought it would be, as I usually only get 4-5 hours straight with my earbuds before they need to charge. Otherwise, they're very solid earbuds and I hope to use them for as many years as I can."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The VR P10 Soundcore true wireless earbuds are unique and have a clean , crisp , sound that's clearly what you want in VR earbuds .

The sound quality is great when you have them connected with the dongle to any device but the audio stream quality dips when using Bluetooth to connect instead. The dongle is made in such a way that you can connect it to the case while it is charging so it doesn't get lost which is nice but it doesnt allow for data transfer between a cable inserted in the female port while the dongle is connected to a vr headset so no using the dongle mode while you are trying to do pcvr with a quest 3 unless you use airlink""]"

Lightning to C converters tend to get error codes from phone… so I thought these would do the trick. These look like and are listed as exactly that: made for iPhones with C connection. Super frustrating when want to talk to people or record a message or anything that is recording actual voice. Maybe anything Apple has to be made by Apple - wouldn’t surprise me.

Then only one earbud would work and the other one wouldn’t. Then both would work again and then only one would work. Then they would only work when inside the charger. I am not sure why they are “glitchy” but that seems to be what they are. She can’t use them anymore and was really only able to for two weeks.

Great Product !!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Loved these for my 9 year old who was so excited to try them. They don’t get extremely loud and they hold the charge really well. The box says the buds will last over 4 hours and the charge of the case lasts 17. I’m not sure they really met those times, but they did what we needed them to do. Definitely should have adjusted the ear bud size (which does come in the pack) but we tried these for the first time in the car. Now, one is missing because it fell out of his ear so definitely make sure you size everything properly before use. Definitely recommend to get a kiddo so you don’t have to do AirPods.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been wanting to get my son a pair of earbuds but wasn't quite sure how he'd do. He is Autistic and has sensory issues, especially when it comes to his ears. I came across these Belkin SoundForm Nano Wireless Earbuds and decided to give them a try. These are for kids ages 7 years and older. My son is 8, and even with his sensory issues he's doing great with these! He really seems to like them, and actually leaves them in. They're very comfortable when wearing, and fit his ears perfectly! These came with 4 different earbud tips that can be changed out to fit better. There is an XXS, XS, S, M, L size tips that are designed for smaller ears. One thing I really like with these is, they prevent loudness over 85dB for a safe listening experience. Next, pairing these was very easy! They paired to his tablet and TV within seconds of turning on the Bluetooth. He can control several features from the earbuds. To turn the volume up use the right one, down use the left. Play/pause can be controlled by either earbud. Skip forward, tap the right one 3 times, backwards, tap the left 3 times. To answer a phone call tap twice on the left, to decline tap twice on the right. Lastly, the battery life is fantastic! These hold up over 24 hours on a full 2 hour charge.

I did find the three built in sound profiles to be good enough but a more demanding listener may not. There is little to no noise cancelling when wearing these, I found I could still hear a vacuum cleaner and my cats while wearing these and playing music. Not really an issue if you just want earbuds that sound decent but if that is something you are looking for these are not the earbuds for you. The microphone quality is good, I used them for phone calls with no complaints of dropped words, low volume, or background sounds. The case has a battery indicator light that uses color to estimate battery percentage left, you do need to remember what color means what percentage or simply remember what color is full and charge as needed. My personal favorite part of the case is the quick guide on the top. When learning the controls this is a lifesaver. Overall I think these are very good value for the price but may not be a good fit for someone looking to wear these to cancel out external noises.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I already own Apple AirPods and so naturally I compared them. The packaging is very sleek and feels more expensive, I love how compact these earbuds are. I also like how the charger is the same one I use for virtually anything now.

I was able to hear the quality of the sound, which is very good it does Actually isolate other sound so it was as if I was just hearing the music I didn’t hear anything any voices anything around me it just was music which was great. I was walking with them throughout the stores and they stayed in. The music was still good. The connection was really good to my cell phone which was in my Jean pocket at the time, and I like to sleep look I like how easy it is to come out of the case I have a pair Skullcandy‘s and they’re hard to get out.

I like to run and walk so this would work great for me especially when I’m running errands and just listening to music through my earbuds makes life easier than having to pick out your butt to have a wire iPhone he’s very comfortable.

This peoduct is closing the 200 dollar mark and feel cheaper than a pair an airpods. What am inpaying for here. The brand name ?', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound quality my only issue is the microphone. The microphone as explained to me by my gaming buddies makes it sound like you are in speaker phone. Because of this when playing competitive games where communication is key such as Escape from tarkov I have had to resort to using my current headset. I would still recommend this product for the on the go gamer or if you’re just playing something alone. But as for microphone issues I would recommend getting a stand alone in combination with these ear buds.', 'these are great, the sound is excellent, and battery life is good too, but i think mine are defective cause the recharging is not working quite right', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound quality, battery life and multipurpose function is amazing.

Sometimes my AirPods get staticky but have yet to experience that with these. They are also very easy to get set up & we’re already charged so I could use right away.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m so happy I’ve received these SoundForm Bolt Wireless Earbuds from Belkin! I was lucky to be able to pick my earbuds in a beautiful lilac color😍 They came already charged, so I was able to connected them super fast, less than in a minute. To connect them simply turn on you Bluetooth > Search > find “SoundForm Bolt” and Voila - you are connected! The sound is clean and clear. The earbuds look cute and stylish. Excellent choice for the affordable price! Enjoy 😉', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are buds are fantastically comfortable. I usually shy away from ear buds in preference of over ear head phones, but these are comfortable! I was able to use the medium size ear accessory with the most comfort and am grateful for the options. The sound is excellent, but maybe a little tinny if that makes sense. I use my earbuds for movie watching, podcasts, and music while working out. They felt secure while working out. They were easy to use and I barely needed to look at the instructions, as I’ve used earbuds before and they’re designed similarly. They keep their charge for a very long time, but I did not time it. I rarely need to charge them, but I don’t use them for many hours a day. Overall, I love these and would highly recommend them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very impressed by these earbuds! The price point is great for the quality you’re given. The packaging is very sturdy, almost hard to open! The case comes fully charged, which is such a great surprise. Pairing was super easy with my iPhone. I love the features it has as well. You can play/pause, skip, answer calls, and more! The sound quality is *okay* considering the cost. It is a little tinny, BUT the noise canceling is surprisingly good. The size of earbud is also a little big on the outside (the part that isn’t in your ears) but the earbud itself fits comfortably.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not only do these look cute, they provide high quality sound as well as a super long battery life. I have not charged them since they arrived and they are still going strong! This is about an hour of use every day for nearly a week, wow! They pair quickly with my iPhone, as soon as I take them out of the case, they are paired. I only had to set up Bluetooth pairing once and since then I've been good to go! I also love the controls that allow me to quickly skip songs and pause without needing to touch my phone. These have been amazing and this is not something I'd normally purchase for myself, but I highly recommend getting these!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I highly recommend the Belkin SoundForm Bolt Wireless Earbuds. I love the purple color on them, more importantly I love the sound. These are great wireless earbuds, they fit in my ear perfectly and also have more rubber earbuds to change out to find the size that works best for you. These were so easy to use, take them out of the box sync them with my phone and you are ready to go. I used the earbuds while I went for a walk and they stayed in my ear comfortably for the whole walk. I highly recommend these SoundForm Bolt Wireless Earbuds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tried these out after my AirPods blew a speaker. I like the forest green case and earbuds. The earbuds themselves are LARGE. They definitely run the risk of getting knocked out of the ear due to their size. They come with one set of silicone coverings to keep them in your ear and to cover the speakers. I was actually very surprised that the package only included one size which doesn’t allow for a good fit. Due to their size and not being adjustable these didn’t stay in my ears very well. The sound quality is good for inexpensive ear buds, but I wish that Belkin would have included additional sizes for the silicone coverings.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so surprised by how much I like these earbuds! First of all, the color is so cute but the quality really surprised me. It took me a minute to figure out the most comfortable position to wear these but once I played around with them, they fit super well. I appreciate that they included different-sized tips with the product. These also seem to have a bit of a noise-cancelling effect which is very nice and the sound quality is amazing. My only complaint is that the earbud case feels a little cheap but I don’t have any complaints about the earbud itself! Definitely a great product for the price!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like these earbuds. I love the color of them, and the sound quality is really good, especially for the price. The case is kind of bulky, though. The battery does last a long time, which is a good thing. The earbuds connect to my phone easily. The earbuds themselves feel a bit bulky and uncomfortable in my ears, even with the changed ear tips. Overall, I do like them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm quite impressed. The sound quality is crystal clear, and it's a delight to listen to music with these earbuds. Plus, the battery life is remarkable; I can use them for hours without worrying about recharging. What's more, they fit comfortably in my ears, making them perfect for extended use.

I love these. I definitely recommend them."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used Anker products for quite some time and I have always been impressed. When I got the chance to pick up Anker’s Soundcore Life Note 3i, I was banking on having that same impression. I can honestly say that they didn’t let me down at all. Out of the box, these true wireless earbuds come in a nice little case for protecting and charging them. Also in the box, there are two additional tips for different sized ear openings as well as a charging cable for the case. With charging in mind, they say this set can play for 9 hours before needing a charge. I haven’t come close to that, but I haven’t come close to depleting them after almost 3 hours of wear. I also own another couple of companies’ earbuds and this battery life definitely exceeds both of those higher priced options. On the noise canceling side of things, I am very impressed with what I experienced. My true test for anything that claims to have Active Noise Canceling is…mowing the lawn. While I know that it won’t completely drown out the mower, I want to be able to hear my music, podcast, or sportscasters clearly. That’s exactly what I got here. It performs just as well as another pair that’s about triple the price. That’s what I call a good deal. I did have to change out the default tips to the smaller ones. Once I did that, I downloaded the app and started to rock out. I found them comfortable and lightweight. Others have caused me discomfort after an hour and I didn’t experience that here. I am very pleased with that. As far as the sound goes, I am not an audiophile by any means, but I am looking for a crisp sound with everything I listen to. I don’t want to hear any distortion or vibration from the bass and the vocals should be clear. The Life Note 3i performed very well in this area. To go along with that, you can use the Soundcore app to adjust the equalizer to even fine tune it more. There are 21 presets to choose from or you can go with the Custom option to get exactly what you want. I found the app easy to use here and consider it a must have. In continuing with the app, you can set what the buttons on the side of the earbuds do as well. I welcome the customization on that as well. The last thing that I was hoping to use the Life Note 3i for was phone calls while on the move. This is where I have to knock them a tad. I was trying to complete some minor tasks around the house while talking and the person could hear things that I was doing. I really hoped the 4 integrated microphones and custom algorithm for vocals would perform better. Ultimately, Anker’s Soundcore Life Note 3i are quite the bang for the buck. These earbuds are priced at about a ⅓ to a ½ of some bigger competitors and the performance is nearly as good. For everyday use or travel, I think these are a great option for any and all. I will certainly be using mine whenever I need great sound and noise canceling.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Soundcore’s Life Note 3i challenges the idea that you must spend a high price to achieve great headphone performance. The noise reduction is a bit above average, and the sound quality is mostly similar to more costly competitors. The full featured App adds a collection of sound enhancements that contribute more value. There is nothing about the Life Note 3i earbuds pushing me to run to the high priced earbud choices. SETUP: I had to make a few attempts to connect to bluetooth, but that sorted itself out without me doing anything special. I’m listening to music within minutes. Button presses on either right or left ear bud shell calls up Noise Cancellation or cancels it, and enable phone answering or call end. I’m in control of the music without using the App, but it is worth downloading. Bluetooth connectivity doesn’t require the Soundcore App to be loaded or open, but the App won’t find the earbuds until the connection is made. Soundcore App: It is within the App that you can create a collection of customized sound curves using a multi band (?? adjustment points) equalizer. The changes you make can be as subtle or exaggerated as you desire, and saved under names you assign. Soundcore has its own collection of modifications, also saved under names that hint at the types of music they might enhance. I consider this sound contouring tool as a way to correct recordings that don’t sound balanced. So, for example, my older 60s/70s recording lack a modern bass emphasis. I created an “oldies bass” contour and saved it under that name. The App provides a noise cancellation circuit which can be selected by button presses on the earbud shell or within the App. I have my two at home tests. Our laundry room lets me test for medium frequency loud fan motor whooshing and the drum beat of the washer. The Life Note 3i does a great job eliminating the lower bass and thrumming sounds. The whooshing was modified with the lower frequencies removed but mostly still there, if a bit quieter. Sitting in my main TV listening area with the TV playing loudly illustrates how effective these earbuds are at stripping away voices in a busy environment. That loud TV, limited by the noise cancellation of the Life Notes, now seems to be playing in a distant room. Decent performance but not as good as the category leaders. That said, it will still be very helpful on plane rides. Other stuff: These are very light weight, and stay comfortable in the ears for lengthy listening sessions. The charging case is quite small. They sadly lack mag-safe charging. SUMMARY: I love headphone Apps that offer any amount of sound equalization. The Life Note 3i goes well beyond any other headphones on the score. I always prefer a few more ear cushions but the included set was adequate. A good fit contributes to the effectiveness of the sound cancellation circuit which won’t challenge the industry leaders, but still gets the job done. And most importantly, sound accuracy was great, and music of all types sounded natural. These are a great earbud that everyone in our house will reach for.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] BACKGROUND: I am 71 and over the past 60 years used an assortment of varying priced wired headphones, wired earbuds, and wireless earbuds. My current wireless earbuds are fine for general use and primarily worn on my 5 mile power walking. But they never really lived up to my expectations for music, specifically classic rock and jam bands. For in home listening, I use a set of moderately priced wired studio “cans” that far exceed my existing wireless earbuds. ANKER SOUNDCORE: This Life Note 3i set of wireless noise canceling earbuds were sent to me for trial and review, and so far I am overall very impressed. Like most all medium priced earbuds, they have their assets along with a few minor liabilities. STATED FEATURES: Noise Canceling Earbuds, with 4 Mic’s, AI-Enhanced Calls, 10mm Oversized Drivers, Soundcore App for Custom EQ, 36H Playtime, Transparency Mode, IPX5 Water-Resistant. PAIRING: Out of the box I was able to immediately pair with my Android-10 phone. So they passed my “no manual needed” test to plug-and-play music. Also paired with my iPad without issues. But I did have problems pairing with an entry level Androide-10 tablet, it found it but would only play through the right channel. Trying a second time, it just would not find these at all. After a few reboots it finally synced it. Now there is a way to reset these with a button on the bottom of the charging case. I was ready to try that, but I didn’t need to. MANUAL: Too small to read anything, almost useless other than the pictures. I went online to locate and download a PDF version to actually view a readable manual. (Normally I download all manuals to my laptop for future reference.) APPLICATION: As expected, Soundcore has an application that will extend the capabilities of these earbuds. After using for a few hours listening to an online Goose concert, it was time to download the APP. It loaded without issues and found my paired Life Note 3i earbuds. The app’s equalizer feature far exceeds my existing phone’s EQ app, a major plus for that. There are numerous preset EQ’s available to choose from, something for everyone. Or you can setup a custom setting tweaking a range of 8 frequencies. After fiddling with all of them, I bonded with the ROCK EQ setting. There are also 3 Ambient Sound selections: Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Normal. I found that the Noise Cancellation mode extends the bass response a tad, and I actually like that, so that is my default combo settings. The app will also allow you to change the button controls to your needs if you don’t like the defaults. CONTROLS: At first I could not get these to raise or lower the volume. I have been accustomed to my other set of wireless buds that use “touch sensors” to activate the controls. Not these Life Notes, they actually use push frame ends. (My bad for not fully paying attention to the manual.) For the most part, these function adequately, but the right button occasionally seems to stick not allowing it to function until it pops back in place (the primary reason for the 4 rating.). VOLUME: These can get much louder than my current set of ear buds. And with the added strong bass response through the APP, I need to be careful not to exacerbate my tinnitus from years playing guitar in a classic rock-and-roll band. The good news here is, these ear-buds have no problem drowning out the ringing in my ears. I guess that’s a good thing, although my doctor may disagree. BATTERY LIFE: The Life Note 3i have a stated battery life of 9-hours play time from a full charge, with an additional 36-hours from the charging case. Doubtful anyone would listen for 9 hours straight, but if you wear these all day for noise canceling then just maybe. Anyway, I have no need or desire to test time capacities, (at my age, uncertain I can stay up for 9 hrs) so I may never really know. NOISE CANCELING: Of the 3 modes - Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Normal, it seems to me the Transparency Mode cancels out more of the background noise versus Noise Canceling Mode. Don’t know why, but with or without music playing, Transparency is the setting to cancel out additional background noise. COMFORT: These include 3 sizes of buds. I have not needed to try the smaller or lager size buds, the default work just fine. The buds are a unique design to me, not the solid foam, solid gel, or solid silicone type I have been accustomed to wearing. They are a somewhat hollow design that allows a much better secure fit (see last picture). I suspect the sealed fit contributes to the increase in bass response. But in any event, they are very comfortable verse the other bud types mentioned. PHONE CALLS: No issues here, both myself and the caller can hear just fine. Had to use the phone’s volume control, versus the earbud’s control, due to unintentionally either putting callers on mute or hanging up on them, when attempting to raise the volume. PLAYING MUSIC SOUND QUALITY: Well this is where the Life Note 3i excels, they far surpass my current wireless earbuds for music listening. And they come close to my wire studio headphones listening online. Plus they are more comfortable to wear vs. my “cans” for longer period of listing pleasure. OVERALL: Three of my current four listing devices will continue to server a purpose. My cheap set of wired earbuds will now be retired. My current set of wireless earbuds we be demoted and will still be used for my sweat power walking, not wanting to possibly damage the new Life Note 3i’s. And my wire studio headphones will still be used for my CD and DVD music collection listening when I don’t want to disturb the wife. But I truly believe the lion share of use will now be from the Anker Soundcore - Life Note 3i earbuds. LEFT or RIGHT: One additional minor nit is being able to determine which is the left bud veruse the right bud when you have them out of the case. If I use a 10x loupe, I can see the micro-markings of a raised L or R. Anyway, I will need to put a RED dot of nail polish over the Right side “R” for quicker reference, and probably a white dot on the left. PICTURES: All are stock photos from Anker except the last one of the unique buds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Looking for another pair of earbuds for travel, I was very intrigued with this set. These Life Note 3i are very decent earbuds from Soundcore brand. I took them on a trip this week and here are my thoughts. Right away I noticed that the case and earbuds are very reminiscent of the Apple AirPods Pro. The tips have a nice silicone end and are very comfortable to wear. They provide 2 other sizes in the box (small and large) with a medium size already in place. I switched over to the small ones and felt the very similar feel to the Apple ones. The step too angles down and feels very good resting down my ear. I also enjoy with this short stem and how they conforms with my ear, they feel very secure and I don’t fear they are going to fall out. With these, it would do you well to download the Soundcore app because it offers helpful tools such as switching to Normal, Transparency and Noise Cancellation modes. You also have a battery indicator, equalizer and controls functions. Speaking of Control Functions, this helpful tool tells you with simple squeezing of the stems can either adjust volume, next, previous, play/pause on either stem. Now to sound quality: this is where I felt the Life Note 3i could have been better. The sound is good, not great. They come in a little light and sometimes hard to hear when in public areas. I don’t want to crank them up super loud so utilizing the Noise Cancellation would be best. Unfortunately, they are not fully All Noise Cancelling and the outdoor sound does bleed in. When in quieter areas, the sound is crisp and has good base sounds. On phone/zoom calls, I came in very clear as well with not distortions. Setting up can be a pain in syncing with your device. Also, the lid of the case has a little lip area which makes it easy to flip open with your thumb. Overall, these are very good and decent earbuds. I wished they provided better noise cancellation but are great when in less busier rooms. They are very comfortable to wear and will last you the day with various listening modes (movies, music, audio books).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are awesome! I've tried out a few other brands before (Altec Lansing, Apple, Skull Candy) and Soundcore is by far the best I've tried. They're super affordable and have great battery life and sound quality. There's probably better sounding earbuds out there, but for the price, these earbuds are outstanding. I've had soundcore headphones and earbuds, at least 4 different products and every one has been great. I'm on my second pair of Soundcore life note 3i because I lost one of my first pair. I haven't had any problems with either pair and the earbud that I still have from my first pair still works great.I haven't tried any soundcore brand speakers, but I definitely recommend soundcore brand headphones and earbuds, they're great! Not to mention, super comfortable!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well honeslty these have the best battery life and the noise canceling is great and also great quelity in the music or anything your doing charging is super fast in about 15 minutes and so do the airbuds and also auto connect in the case', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have never heard of this brand ear buds before and I came across it when i was searching for new ones. I absolutely love the noise cancelling feature the most. I work with 3 and 4 year olds and if i took a callthe person on the other end would only hear the kids. Now with these buds i can cancel the background noise. Another positive with these buds is the options, their size and connects great with my samsung phone. They are affordable as well. The price didnt really matter to me as much as I needed buds that can fit my extremely small ears and i took a gamble with these and they exceeded my expectations. One feature I wish can be added is a locator from buds to case and vice-versa or can be located from the phone.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Through the pandemic that we've all collectively experienced over the last few years, working from home and working out somewhere by myself have been more commonplace. I have owned bluetooth earphones for years. Unfortunately for me, my best sounding pair hurts my ears after 45 minutes. This is great for running, but not for long work calls. My most comfortable headset goes over my head and I can't actually run while wearing them. Bring on the Soundcore Life Note 3i by Anker -- I can wear these for hours and not worry about battery life or the discomfort that I feel in my tragus (the external part of your ear that leads to the opening) that results from my most expensive bluetooth earbuds. Each earbud weighs about 4 grams or the weight of 4 paper clips -- and the soft silicone covering tightly which makes for great sound quality. And because they fit so snugly, going running with them has been a breeze. I was a little concerned initially, but the more I've worn them the more comfortable I am that they won't fall out. I did notice that they seemed to have a bit too much bass out of the box, but the soundcore app allowed me to make adjustments to fine tune the quality to a level that I prefer. Speaking of the app, there are options for noise cancelling as well as transparent (or hear through) mode -- they work with just one in at a time, but transparent mode is especially useful when I'm running -- I had no idea how useful this would be until I heard a car turn right through a Stop Sign while I was running early in the morning. I heard the car getting louder and had to run entirely in the road to avoid him from hitting me. I'm not underestimating the value of this feature and likely how it avoided me from getting seriously hurt. The other primo feature when I'm home is that I can use one earbud at a time -- my other set requires that both are in my ears at all times -- I find this feature even better than transparent mode when I'm home. So over the last few months, I've been able to replace my two sets of bluetooth earphones with just this set of Soundcore Life Note 3i -- they are awesome."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first pair of earbuds since I got my 3rd generation iPod Touch. I usually preferred wired or wireless headphones (on-ear and over-ear). I primarily use headphones for traveling or commuting to watch movies, listen to music and podcasts, or when I just wanted to block out the other sound in a room with some ambient music. I am a 62 year old male with tinnitus and significant hearing loss in one ear. With the 3+ pair of earbuds I have tried in the past they either kept falling out, were uncomfortable to wear longer than 30 minutes, and/or the sound quality was very poor. However, I found these to be very comfortable to wear and the sound is great. I have had these for almost 3 weeks now and have used them about 15 days during that time for 2-4 hours each day. I was able to connect them to my cell phone (Samsung S22), tablet (Samsung S3), and Windows PC (Dell XPS) without any problems. What I liked most about these earbuds is how well they fit into my ear and stayed secure. However, I still found if I talked or yawned much, the right one would become loose. Soundcore Anker does provide multiple tips so you can find what fits the best for you. With the Soundcore App, you can customize the controls and sound equalizer to your tastes. The App also allows you to upgrade the firmware and contains some ambient sounds to listen to. The controls on the earbuds are easy to use and provide the typical volume (+/-), advance music (+/-), pause/resume, answer/end calls. But there aren't too touchy that you would have accidental presses. I didn't have high expectations from the built-in microphones, but was very surprised with them. When I was taking a call or on a zoom meeting with the earbuds, no one ever said they couldn't hear or understand me. The range was very good and I was able to get up and walk around during while listening to music or on a zoom meeting. The battery life is excellent even during a long flight (4+ hours), I never saw the battery power drop below 60 percent. The case quickly recharges the earbuds and keeps them secure when not in use. The case has a magnetic closure and holds the earbuds inside. To recharge the case you just plug the case into a USB port with the included cable. The instructions help you get started quickly and tell you everything you need to know from upgrading the firmware, customizing the controls, pairing, support, etc. My only complaint is that the instructions are written in a light blue color on a white background, making them hard to read. You'll just want to download them and read them on your phone, tablet, or laptop. Overall, I love these and will certainly use them during my travels and commute or around the house or office.""]"

I was trying to complete some minor tasks around the house while talking and the person could hear things that I was doing. I really hoped the 4 integrated microphones and custom algorithm for vocals would perform better. Ultimately, Anker’s Soundcore Life Note 3i are quite the bang for the buck. These earbuds are priced at about a ⅓ to a ½ of some bigger competitors and the performance is nearly as good. For everyday use or travel, I think these are a great option for any and all. I will certainly be using mine whenever I need great sound and noise canceling.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Soundcore’s Life Note 3i challenges the idea that you must spend a high price to achieve great headphone performance. The noise reduction is a bit above average, and the sound quality is mostly similar to more costly competitors. The full featured App adds a collection of sound enhancements that contribute more value. There is nothing about the Life Note 3i earbuds pushing me to run to the high priced earbud choices. SETUP: I had to make a few attempts to connect to bluetooth, but that sorted itself out without me doing anything special. I’m listening to music within minutes. Button presses on either right or left ear bud shell calls up Noise Cancellation or cancels it, and enable phone answering or call end. I’m in control of the music without using the App, but it is worth downloading. Bluetooth connectivity doesn’t require the Soundcore App to be loaded or open, but the App won’t find the earbuds until the connection is made. Soundcore App: It is within the App that you can create a collection of customized sound curves using a multi band (?? adjustment points) equalizer. The changes you make can be as subtle or exaggerated as you desire, and saved under names you assign. Soundcore has its own collection of modifications, also saved under names that hint at the types of music they might enhance. I consider this sound contouring tool as a way to correct recordings that don’t sound balanced. So, for example, my older 60s/70s recording lack a modern bass emphasis. I created an “oldies bass” contour and saved it under that name. The App provides a noise cancellation circuit which can be selected by button presses on the earbud shell or within the App. I have my two at home tests. Our laundry room lets me test for medium frequency loud fan motor whooshing and the drum beat of the washer. The Life Note 3i does a great job eliminating the lower bass and thrumming sounds. The whooshing was modified with the lower frequencies removed but mostly still there, if a bit quieter. Sitting in my main TV listening area with the TV playing loudly illustrates how effective these earbuds are at stripping away voices in a busy environment. That loud TV, limited by the noise cancellation of the Life Notes, now seems to be playing in a distant room. Decent performance but not as good as the category leaders. That said, it will still be very helpful on plane rides. Other stuff: These are very light weight, and stay comfortable in the ears for lengthy listening sessions. The charging case is quite small. They sadly lack mag-safe charging. SUMMARY: I love headphone Apps that offer any amount of sound equalization. The Life Note 3i goes well beyond any other headphones on the score. I always prefer a few more ear cushions but the included set was adequate. A good fit contributes to the effectiveness of the sound cancellation circuit which won’t challenge the industry leaders, but still gets the job done. And most importantly, sound accuracy was great, and music of all types sounded natural. These are a great earbud that everyone in our house will reach for.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] BACKGROUND: I am 71 and over the past 60 years used an assortment of varying priced wired headphones, wired earbuds, and wireless earbuds. My current wireless earbuds are fine for general use and primarily worn on my 5 mile power walking. But they never really lived up to my expectations for music, specifically classic rock and jam bands. For in home listening, I use a set of moderately priced wired studio “cans” that far exceed my existing wireless earbuds. ANKER SOUNDCORE: This Life Note 3i set of wireless noise canceling earbuds were sent to me for trial and review, and so far I am overall very impressed. Like most all medium priced earbuds, they have their assets along with a few minor liabilities. STATED FEATURES: Noise Canceling Earbuds, with 4 Mic’s, AI-Enhanced Calls, 10mm Oversized Drivers, Soundcore App for Custom EQ, 36H Playtime, Transparency Mode, IPX5 Water-Resistant. PAIRING: Out of the box I was able to immediately pair with my Android-10 phone. So they passed my “no manual needed” test to plug-and-play music. Also paired with my iPad without issues. But I did have problems pairing with an entry level Androide-10 tablet, it found it but would only play through the right channel. Trying a second time, it just would not find these at all. After a few reboots it finally synced it. Now there is a way to reset these with a button on the bottom of the charging case. I was ready to try that, but I didn’t need to. MANUAL: Too small to read anything, almost useless other than the pictures. I went online to locate and download a PDF version to actually view a readable manual. (Normally I download all manuals to my laptop for future reference.) APPLICATION: As expected, Soundcore has an application that will extend the capabilities of these earbuds. After using for a few hours listening to an online Goose concert, it was time to download the APP. It loaded without issues and found my paired Life Note 3i earbuds. The app’s equalizer feature far exceeds my existing phone’s EQ app, a major plus for that. There are numerous preset EQ’s available to choose from, something for everyone. Or you can setup a custom setting tweaking a range of 8 frequencies. After fiddling with all of them, I bonded with the ROCK EQ setting. There are also 3 Ambient Sound selections: Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Normal. I found that the Noise Cancellation mode extends the bass response a tad, and I actually like that, so that is my default combo settings. The app will also allow you to change the button controls to your needs if you don’t like the defaults. CONTROLS: At first I could not get these to raise or lower the volume. I have been accustomed to my other set of wireless buds that use “touch sensors” to activate the controls. Not these Life Notes, they actually use push frame ends. (My bad for not fully paying attention to the manual.) For the most part, these function adequately, but the right button occasionally seems to stick not allowing it to function until it pops back in place (the primary reason for the 4 rating.). VOLUME: These can get much louder than my current set of ear buds. And with the added strong bass response through the APP, I need to be careful not to exacerbate my tinnitus from years playing guitar in a classic rock-and-roll band. The good news here is, these ear-buds have no problem drowning out the ringing in my ears. I guess that’s a good thing, although my doctor may disagree. BATTERY LIFE: The Life Note 3i have a stated battery life of 9-hours play time from a full charge, with an additional 36-hours from the charging case. Doubtful anyone would listen for 9 hours straight, but if you wear these all day for noise canceling then just maybe. Anyway, I have no need or desire to test time capacities, (at my age, uncertain I can stay up for 9 hrs) so I may never really know. NOISE CANCELING: Of the 3 modes - Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Normal, it seems to me the Transparency Mode cancels out more of the background noise versus Noise Canceling Mode. Don’t know why, but with or without music playing, Transparency is the setting to cancel out additional background noise. COMFORT: These include 3 sizes of buds. I have not needed to try the smaller or lager size buds, the default work just fine. The buds are a unique design to me, not the solid foam, solid gel, or solid silicone type I have been accustomed to wearing. They are a somewhat hollow design that allows a much better secure fit (see last picture). I suspect the sealed fit contributes to the increase in bass response. But in any event, they are very comfortable verse the other bud types mentioned. PHONE CALLS: No issues here, both myself and the caller can hear just fine. Had to use the phone’s volume control, versus the earbud’s control, due to unintentionally either putting callers on mute or hanging up on them, when attempting to raise the volume. PLAYING MUSIC SOUND QUALITY: Well this is where the Life Note 3i excels, they far surpass my current wireless earbuds for music listening. And they come close to my wire studio headphones listening online. Plus they are more comfortable to wear vs. my “cans” for longer period of listing pleasure. OVERALL: Three of my current four listing devices will continue to server a purpose. My cheap set of wired earbuds will now be retired. My current set of wireless earbuds we be demoted and will still be used for my sweat power walking, not wanting to possibly damage the new Life Note 3i’s. And my wire studio headphones will still be used for my CD and DVD music collection listening when I don’t want to disturb the wife. But I truly believe the lion share of use will now be from the Anker Soundcore - Life Note 3i earbuds. LEFT or RIGHT: One additional minor nit is being able to determine which is the left bud veruse the right bud when you have them out of the case. If I use a 10x loupe, I can see the micro-markings of a raised L or R. Anyway, I will need to put a RED dot of nail polish over the Right side “R” for quicker reference, and probably a white dot on the left. PICTURES: All are stock photos from Anker except the last one of the unique buds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Looking for another pair of earbuds for travel, I was very intrigued with this set. These Life Note 3i are very decent earbuds from Soundcore brand. I took them on a trip this week and here are my thoughts. Right away I noticed that the case and earbuds are very reminiscent of the Apple AirPods Pro. The tips have a nice silicone end and are very comfortable to wear. They provide 2 other sizes in the box (small and large) with a medium size already in place. I switched over to the small ones and felt the very similar feel to the Apple ones. The step too angles down and feels very good resting down my ear. I also enjoy with this short stem and how they conforms with my ear, they feel very secure and I don’t fear they are going to fall out. With these, it would do you well to download the Soundcore app because it offers helpful tools such as switching to Normal, Transparency and Noise Cancellation modes. You also have a battery indicator, equalizer and controls functions. Speaking of Control Functions, this helpful tool tells you with simple squeezing of the stems can either adjust volume, next, previous, play/pause on either stem. Now to sound quality: this is where I felt the Life Note 3i could have been better. The sound is good, not great. They come in a little light and sometimes hard to hear when in public areas. I don’t want to crank them up super loud so utilizing the Noise Cancellation would be best. Unfortunately, they are not fully All Noise Cancelling and the outdoor sound does bleed in. When in quieter areas, the sound is crisp and has good base sounds. On phone/zoom calls, I came in very clear as well with not distortions. Setting up can be a pain in syncing with your device. Also, the lid of the case has a little lip area which makes it easy to flip open with your thumb. Overall, these are very good and decent earbuds. I wished they provided better noise cancellation but are great when in less busier rooms. They are very comfortable to wear and will last you the day with various listening modes (movies, music, audio books).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are awesome! I've tried out a few other brands before (Altec Lansing, Apple, Skull Candy) and Soundcore is by far the best I've tried. They're super affordable and have great battery life and sound quality. There's probably better sounding earbuds out there, but for the price, these earbuds are outstanding. I've had soundcore headphones and earbuds, at least 4 different products and every one has been great. I'm on my second pair of Soundcore life note 3i because I lost one of my first pair. I haven't had any problems with either pair and the earbud that I still have from my first pair still works great.I haven't tried any soundcore brand speakers, but I definitely recommend soundcore brand headphones and earbuds, they're great! Not to mention, super comfortable!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well honeslty these have the best battery life and the noise canceling is great and also great quelity in the music or anything your doing charging is super fast in about 15 minutes and so do the airbuds and also auto connect in the case', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have never heard of this brand ear buds before and I came across it when i was searching for new ones. I absolutely love the noise cancelling feature the most. I work with 3 and 4 year olds and if i took a callthe person on the other end would only hear the kids. Now with these buds i can cancel the background noise. Another positive with these buds is the options, their size and connects great with my samsung phone. They are affordable as well. The price didnt really matter to me as much as I needed buds that can fit my extremely small ears and i took a gamble with these and they exceeded my expectations. One feature I wish can be added is a locator from buds to case and vice-versa or can be located from the phone.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Through the pandemic that we've all collectively experienced over the last few years, working from home and working out somewhere by myself have been more commonplace. I have owned bluetooth earphones for years. Unfortunately for me, my best sounding pair hurts my ears after 45 minutes. This is great for running, but not for long work calls. My most comfortable headset goes over my head and I can't actually run while wearing them. Bring on the Soundcore Life Note 3i by Anker -- I can wear these for hours and not worry about battery life or the discomfort that I feel in my tragus (the external part of your ear that leads to the opening) that results from my most expensive bluetooth earbuds. Each earbud weighs about 4 grams or the weight of 4 paper clips -- and the soft silicone covering tightly which makes for great sound quality. And because they fit so snugly, going running with them has been a breeze. I was a little concerned initially, but the more I've worn them the more comfortable I am that they won't fall out. I did notice that they seemed to have a bit too much bass out of the box, but the soundcore app allowed me to make adjustments to fine tune the quality to a level that I prefer. Speaking of the app, there are options for noise cancelling as well as transparent (or hear through) mode -- they work with just one in at a time, but transparent mode is especially useful when I'm running -- I had no idea how useful this would be until I heard a car turn right through a Stop Sign while I was running early in the morning. I heard the car getting louder and had to run entirely in the road to avoid him from hitting me. I'm not underestimating the value of this feature and likely how it avoided me from getting seriously hurt. The other primo feature when I'm home is that I can use one earbud at a time -- my other set requires that both are in my ears at all times -- I find this feature even better than transparent mode when I'm home. So over the last few months, I've been able to replace my two sets of bluetooth earphones with just this set of Soundcore Life Note 3i -- they are awesome."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first pair of earbuds since I got my 3rd generation iPod Touch. I usually preferred wired or wireless headphones (on-ear and over-ear). I primarily use headphones for traveling or commuting to watch movies, listen to music and podcasts, or when I just wanted to block out the other sound in a room with some ambient music. I am a 62 year old male with tinnitus and significant hearing loss in one ear. With the 3+ pair of earbuds I have tried in the past they either kept falling out, were uncomfortable to wear longer than 30 minutes, and/or the sound quality was very poor. However, I found these to be very comfortable to wear and the sound is great. I have had these for almost 3 weeks now and have used them about 15 days during that time for 2-4 hours each day. I was able to connect them to my cell phone (Samsung S22), tablet (Samsung S3), and Windows PC (Dell XPS) without any problems. What I liked most about these earbuds is how well they fit into my ear and stayed secure. However, I still found if I talked or yawned much, the right one would become loose. Soundcore Anker does provide multiple tips so you can find what fits the best for you. With the Soundcore App, you can customize the controls and sound equalizer to your tastes. The App also allows you to upgrade the firmware and contains some ambient sounds to listen to. The controls on the earbuds are easy to use and provide the typical volume (+/-), advance music (+/-), pause/resume, answer/end calls. But there aren't too touchy that you would have accidental presses. I didn't have high expectations from the built-in microphones, but was very surprised with them. When I was taking a call or on a zoom meeting with the earbuds, no one ever said they couldn't hear or understand me. The range was very good and I was able to get up and walk around during while listening to music or on a zoom meeting. The battery life is excellent even during a long flight (4+ hours), I never saw the battery power drop below 60 percent. The case quickly recharges the earbuds and keeps them secure when not in use. The case has a magnetic closure and holds the earbuds inside. To recharge the case you just plug the case into a USB port with the included cable. The instructions help you get started quickly and tell you everything you need to know from upgrading the firmware, customizing the controls, pairing, support, etc. My only complaint is that the instructions are written in a light blue color on a white background, making them hard to read. You'll just want to download them and read them on your phone, tablet, or laptop. Overall, I love these and will certainly use them during my travels and commute or around the house or office.""]"
Marshall Major IV On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$169.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/marshall-major-iv-on-ear-bluetooth-headphones-black/15316904/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I must confess that I've never liked on ear headphones. At all. I have always experienced discomfort wearing any brand of on ear headphones so for many years I never even considered buying a pair. Until now. Enter the Marshall Major IV headphones. When I received the package I was taken aback by the size of the box. The packaging is made of recyclable materials so that's a plus in my book. The reason for the small box is that the headphone are foldable and become even more compact. The package contains the headphones, instruction booklet, USB C charging cord and a 3.5mm audio cable that allows you to establish a wired connection or share your music with someone else. Pretty cool when you travel and have a companion. The padding is soft and comfortable, so much so that I have worn them for hours on end and have had no complaints at all. The setup is simple: one button does it all. But the main reason to get them is the sound. For their price they produce more accurate and enjoyable sound than headphones costing 2 times their price or more. I made it a point to listen to a variety of music genres to give a complete review. I found that Rock, Classical, Jazz, Hip Hop, Blues, ETC sounded spot on. I heard some nuances in Classical music that I had previously missed with lesser headphones. Things like the breathing of musicians and tiny background sounds during silences. Amazing. But even if you are satisfied with what I have just described, wait until you hear their party trick. Their battery lasts an incredible 80 hours! I have obviously not worn them for 80 hours straight, but I have used them for several hours each day and ended up charging them because I feared they would end up dead one day, not because I got a low battery warning. I also wanted to try the wireless charging capability, which is also a nifty feature in addition of having an USB C port. While charging the right cup has to come in contact with the wireless charger (not included) and it stayed put without sliding off. I have added a couple of photos to give you an idea of their size, since I am still amazed at the quality of build, sound and battery life. Definitely recommended!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let's start with the sound: Fantastic. It sounds on par with much more expensive headphones. It has a very crisp sound, very neutral. It has plenty of bass but it does not overwhelm the sounds. It faithfully reproduces details that I can barely notice with other headphones. Driven by a 40mm dynamic transducer. Design: It's very unique. These stand out in a good way. The headband is soft with a rich leather texture. The earcups are plush and soft. I can wear these for hours without discomfort. Note however that these are 'over the ear', which means they rest on your ears, not around them like bigger cans. Having well designed cushions makes a big difference here. The outside of the caps are smooth plastic with the Marshall logo embossed in silicone. The headphones fold in making them more compact to carry. They do not fold flat but also they're not very big. They're also very light compared to others. Charging and battery: They're rated for 80 hours, which is incredible. I've been using them all week without recharging them and the phone reports the headphones have over 65% battery left. The connector is USB-C and comes with a long USB-A to USB-C cable. USB-C is so convenient now that it's becoming the norm. And, this is great, also supports Qi wireless charging: Place the right earcup on top of a charging pad and it has a small light that indicates it's charging. Once I unpacked them they came mostly charged, but left them for a while on a portable wireless charger until full. Controls: This is perhaps the most user friendly control I've used on headphones: It has a single tiny rocker button that works like a joystick: Hold it to turn it on and off. Keep holding for pairing. Once connected, press once for play/pause. Push it up or down for volume control Push it left or right for prev/next. Hold it left or right for REV/FF (very few headphones do this). Double click: Phone's assistant. Might sound too much, but no, it's very intuitive. It comes naturally and took no time at all to start using it. To answer and hang up calls, click on the button, or double-click to reject it. There are no apps to install on the phone. It just works, and sounds great. But there is one very nice quirk, I have not seen anywhere else: It has an audio connector on the right earcup. It comes with a long and partly coiled cable that can be connected to a computer or other audio source like an amp with headphones output, and this works well. The headphones can be used without using it's battery (like traditional wired headphones), which can be a life saver in some cases. Recently had to use them with a computer by just plugging them in. The really nice quirk is that while listening to music via Bluetooth, can connect any other wired headphones to these to share the audio, like when you want to share a song with someone near you that has wired headphones. Not sure how much I'll use this personally but it's nice to have. Note that there wired cable has no mic nor phone controls, and that's OK. (There are 3rd party cables that could do that). It has no ANC, but the earcups cover up normal household noise just fine. There is a single mic on the right earcup to take phone calls or use the phone's assistant (Siri or Google). Nothing special here but it works just fine. Overall I'm very impressed how well they sound and convenience like the best controls (to me) in a headphone, they're light, ridiculously long battery life, wireless charging, they're light and they look just great."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Slip on these lightweight headphones with the classic Marshall old school look and you will love the sound they deliver! And the joy will last for hours of listening since they are so comfortable and have an amazing battery life. Founded in 1963, Marshall Amplification has become the best known designer and manufacturer of professional music amplifiers and stage speakers. Its classic “Marshall” script on the grill cloth is a guarantee that the equipment is top quality and will produce, as Pete Townshend noted, “sizzling sound with crunch!” Since 2010 Marshall has worked closely with Sweden’s top-rated Zound Industries to create consumer versions of its audio equipment. This review will focus on the latest of these collaborations, the Marshall Major IV wireless portable Bluetooth headphones, a surprisingly powerful unit with amazing sound quality and some great bonus features. After extensive testing of the new Major IV Bluetooth headphones in a wide variety of applications my conclusion is that these very compact and lightweight cans have a superb combination of features, power and sound quality which far surpass the vast majority of its competitors in its price range. First, consider that the Major IV headphones are packed with a great set of features and specifications: • Marshall Major IV Bluetooth on-ear headphones (Model 1005773) • 40mm dynamic drivers, 32 ohm impedance • Frequency response range: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz • Total Harmonic Distortion of less than 1% • Maximum sound pressure level (SPL) 99 dB (100mV @ 1 kHz) • Bluetooth 5.0 SBC connectivity, 33 foot range • Integrated microphone in each ear cup for phone calls • Ergonomic textured vinyl cushioned ear cups, padded headband • Ear cup fold clip collapsible design for compact storage • Multi-function control knob (on/off, volume, play, pause, skip track, accept phone call) • Lithium polymer battery life: 80+ hours playtime with Bluetooth • 3 hour recharge time from full discharge; 15 minute recharge provides 15 hours playtime • Wireless charging (Qi pad required, not included) • 43” USB-C 5V-12V recharge cable included • 78” 3.5 mm audio cord included for passive listening (no power required) or connecting a second headset • Weight: 5.9 ounces • One year warranty on parts and labor For more than fifty years the iconic Marshall scrip on an amplified speaker has become emblematic of the quintessential rock concert experience. Those speakers always had old school black cabinets and big analog control knobs. When you saw them you knew that you were in for a night of rock ecstasy. The new Major IV headphones successfully combine that traditional look but are based upon modern technology. Major IV headphones come securely packaged within a shock-resistant storage box. Included is a simple illustrated getting started brochure, the usual safety warnings, a USB-C charging cable and a 78” long 3.5 mm connecting cable for passive listening or to add a second headset. When you open the box you will see how compactly the headphones can be collapsed, thanks to the ear cup fold clip. They easily fit within a 5 inch circle – just slightly larger than the diameter of a 2 liter bottle of soda. The next change you will experience is the process for charging the headphones. While a nice USB-C cable is included and could be used to recharge the headphones, Marshall has added wireless charging capability. Just place the right ear cup on any Qi charging pad and the unit will recharge. The Zounds engineers have facilitated this by putting a thin black silicone border on the outside of the ear cup and crafting the “Marshall” scrip in silicone as well to provide slip-resistance on the charging plate. Once fully charged it will be a long time before you need to recharge these headphones. They are rated for an amazing 80 hours of playtime! Even if you use them three hours every day that gives you nearly a month before they need recharging. And if you are impatient, just 15 minutes on the charger gives you 15 hours of use. The Marshall Major IV headphones are much smaller than typical over-the-ear headphones (see photo for a comparison with one of my other headphones) and are technically “on-the-ear” headphones because they do not fully enclose your ears. But unlike most on-the-ear headphones the Marshall Major IV really give an excellent seal over your ears thanks to the generous and very soft padding on each ear cup. This insures that all of the sound produced by the 40 mm drivers is delivered to your ear drums. The small physical size has another important benefit – light weight. The Marshall Major IV earphones weigh only 5.9 ounces, compared to 10.8 ounces for the over-the-ear headphones in my photos. You can wear these headphones all day in blissful comfort. The controls for these headphones is a wonderful homage to the Marshall tradition. A single gold knob on the right ear cup controls volume (push up or down), tracks (push forward or back), power (press two seconds), answer phone (one tap), etc. It is all very intuitive. And the knob looks cool. The Bluetooth connection is rock solid (what else?) well beyond the 30 foot range claimed. I would give it at least 40 feet. The codec used is the basic SBC rather than the more sophisticated aptX but the drivers are well-tuned for that codec. I have always had a feeling that on-the-ear headphones are inferior in sound quality to a good over-the-ear headphone. I have several of both types and prior to testing the Marshall Major IV my personal experience justified that feeling. But after thoroughly testing the Marshall Major IV headphones I am prepared to retract that proposition. I played some of my favorite rock, jazz, classical, country and vocal music albums through these headphones over the past week. In each case I found that the Marshall Major IV headphones have an outstanding ability to deliver a superb rendition of any musical source you may draw upon. The drivers have been tuned to provide an accurate sonic image and are very responsive to music which has rapid shifts and extensive tonal range. They capture all of Janis Joplin’s soulful, “Me & Bobbie McGee” from the deep bass to the highest guitar note and never lose a bit of her ragged, breathy voice. The full majesty of Bach’s “Concerto for 2 Violins” by Anne-Sophie Mutter and the English Chamber Orchestra comes through undiminished. You will feel that you are truly “Live at Operation Breadbasket” as Cannonball Adderly plays “Walk Tall” feeling the thump of the bass and the sweet soprano sax. Play Garth Brooks through these headphones and you are standing right in front of the stage getting sawdust kicked in your face. And rock? Please, all you need to know about their ability to drive an electric rhythm backed up by a bass that sounds like Thor pounding his hammer, is to look at that “Marshall” script proudly blazing on each ear cup! The headphones are exceptionally comfortable due to their feathery weight, the nicely padded headband and very generous earcup padding. You literally could wear these for hours and be aware of only the music they deliver to your ears. I have several pairs of over-the-ear headphones which provide stellar music reproduction, automatic noise reduction and complete isolation, all of which have a cost two or three times the Marshall Major IV’s modest price tag. When you want to be alone with your music or desire isolation from ambient noise, they are an excellent choice. But they are all heavy and you do feel that your ears are being compressed so it is really not comfortable to use them for more than a couple of hours at a time. No, the Marshall Major IV has no automatic noise reduction, but when was the last time you went to a rock concert to be isolated from your environment. The beauty of these on-the-air headphones is that you are still a bit involved in the world around you but the music dominates. It is like the difference between watching a movie alone in your home theater or going to a movie with friends. If you want to be transported back to the musical glories of the rock era but don’t want to give up any of the technologic comforts of today buy these outstanding headphones. They have my highest and unqualified endorsement and you will crank up your cool quotient to 11.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you want some style with your high quality audio headphones. Marshall Major 4 is the way to go. Lots of really nice textured leather like material that you see on all the Marshall products. Very comfortable on the ears and more compact than you would expect given the days of battery life and booming bass you get. And YES, they last for DAYS between charging!! It\'s only been 3 days for me of many listening sessions and still showing 70% on the Bluetooth of my phone. And if you want bass from your headphones. These have it. For me the audio had plenty of bass and sounded great without having to push the volume past 50%, if that makes sense to those who really like it loud. And while these are ""on ear"" headphones. The sound stayed mostly in your ears with minimal leak as to not disturb those near by. While I do wish there was a bag or case to hold the headphones and the 2 included cables(USB A to USB C charge cable and 3.5 to 3.5 audio cable). The headphones do have handy little hook built in to keep them ultra compact when folded up. Sadly I don\'t have a Qi charging pad yet. But these are able to charge wirelessly if you have the Qi pad. Overall: Marshall style. Battery for days! Comfortable. Compact. Great bass response. Microphones for calls and assistant ready.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall Major IV compared to earlier generation offers comfort with its form fitting square shaped ear cups. Ear cups are made of textured black vinyl or leatherette and comes only in one color(black). It offers great comfort, wireless charging capabilities on a over the head headphones with 80 hours of playback. This headset is advertised as 20Hz to 20kHZ frequency response range, 44mm drivers and so it sounds really good. Bass on this headphone is good but may not be very good for audiophiles but is decent and competes with other high end manufacturers. Sounds very close to Bose headphone without the active noise cancellation feature. Pairing is very easy, just turn on for the first time, blue light blinks and it detects the headphone on your mobile or computer. If you need to pair to another device, just press and hold the gold control knob center button for few seconds and it enters the pairing mode. This headset is advertised at 80+hours of wireless playtime and has Bluetooth 5.0 tech. Also, 15 minute quick charge will get 15 hours of playtime which is a great improvement compared to earlier generation. Wireless charging is supported for this headset which is a great feature where very few over the head headphones are available in the market. Just fold the headphones and place the right ear down on the Qi charger(not included) for wireless charging. Since, I have Qi charger lying around my home in all rooms, wireless charging is a great added feature. It also supports wired charging using USB C cable for fast quick charging compared to micro USB on previous gen. Control knob or joystick on the right ear is a very handy and has multiple controls on one button. This multi directional joy stick is used to power on/off, pairing, volume control, rewind or forward functions. Just press and hold the center button to power on/off, double click and hold enters into pairing mode, swiping left or right skips to next song, up and down for increasing or decreasing volume. This joystick control is very intuitive and preferred for ease of use compared to touch controls that is available on Bose or Sony headphones. What’s in the box: Headset, 3.5mm coiled cable, USB-C cable for charging, manuals. Bottom line: This is a nice headset for the unique features like wireless charging, 80+hours of battery that it offers for the affordable price. Only caveat is this headset has no active noise cancellation but for the price it’s acceptable.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impressions of these headphones out of the box is that the ear cups are small. They are definitely smaller than most headphones on the market these days. They fit and rest comfortably on my ears though. Build quality is excellent. The headband is flexible yet strong and is wrapped in faux leather that looks and feels like soft leather.. The ear cups themselves are small and to me look like tiny marshal cabinets. :D The padding is soft and squishy, very comfortable and do a great job of isolating sound and keeping music from leaking out ( except at max volumes ). They charge with a USB C cable which is included. They can also be charged wirelessly with the right ear cup. I've uploaded a picture of the ear cup sitting on my wireless charger. it works well, but you do have to balance them properly over the charger. I'm curious to see if they will magnetically attach to the new apple MagSafe charger later. They have a small nub joystick on the right cup that also acts as a power on / off and pairing button. It can activate Siri or Google Assistant and also control volume and skip, rewind and pause tracks. I personally really enjoy the joystick for controls because it prevents any accidental touches or swipes that are inevitable with touch controls. Sound Quality : Impressive! Considering their small size and on ear fit.. they sound very good. I'd say they are well balanced although to my ears highs seem to come in at a slightly higher volume. Bass sounds good and doesn't drown out everything else. The Highs seem to come in louder than Mids , but I usually prefer music tuned that way. Music remains clear with a nice hint of bass. Mids are still noticeable without sounding muddy. I tested them with a variety of music genres and everything sounded great to me. For some reason the Marshall Bluetooth app on my iPhone could not recognize these headphones yet so I wasn't able to play with the EQ settings. Hopefully they will update the app later on. When using these headphones to watch videos , Movies and TV shows there was no noticeable audio lag to me. I enjoyed watching a couple shows and a movie with them. Voices are loud and clear while keeping the action and music well balanced. Battery life is excellent, after fully charging them out of the box.. I have used them for a few hours each day for the last three days and have not had to plug them back in yet. If you prefer on ear headphones over buds or over the ear headphones, then I think you will be happy with this headset. They have a beautiful classic design, sound quality is very good and battery life is excellent. The wireless charging feature is a nice touch although I still prefer to plug my devices in."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sounds great and compact for travel. Just wish it came with a case. I did order a clam shell case from Amazon for about $14 which fit perfectly and was surprisingly good quality. I bought on Cyber Mondy at a significant discount.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Light weight, comfortable small footprint. Power on and pairs blue tooth instantly with my Samsung S20+ Android listening to Pandora awesome sound and clarity and still be able to hear other people in the room clearly. Wireless charging works perfectly on any flat charging pad. Also pairs blue tooth instantly with my desktop pc and all our TV'S I prefer using blue tooth connection didn't really try other features but I certainly can recommend for my use. The price I think could be a little less but it is certainly a top performing quality product."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased these headphones for my wife as a Mother's Day present in 2021. Now, 17 months later, they have totally died and will no longer take a charge. I was particularly disappointed with Marshall's response, or lack thereof. My wife takes very good care of her electronics, and there is absolutely no physical damage to the headphones. We tried numerous different chargers and cables - they are simply dead. Next time, we will go with a tried-and-true brand, like Bose or Sony."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My first impression after unboxing these headphones were that the ear pieces looked smaller than most the over the ear style headphones, however after putting them on I quickly realized that they are by far one of the most comfortable pairs of headphones in this style that I've worn. Pairing the device with my phone was super easy and required no instructions. Hit pair, search via phone, sync. Easy as 1,2,3. The sound quality is really good too, I listened to a variety of music to see the range these headphones had and was rather impressed with the quality, the bass tones are awesome with these headphones and the treble is crisp. The toggle on the headphone to pause, resume, turn the volume up and down, skip and rewind the songs is a nice feature as well. All in all, pretty straight forward pair of headphones that sync easily while providing top notch sound.""]"
Sony WH-1000XM5 Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Smoky Pink,$399.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wh-1000xm5-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-smoky-pink/18477938/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so happy with this sony headphones!! The sound quality is amazing, It’s so soft. The material is so soft and the features is great. You can skip or pause by clicking with your finger. It is so comfortable and has great noise cancellation. The design is so neat and stylish it has a clean look. The best thing about it is the cup is big and it didn’t hurt my ears. But the only thing concern about is the case holder is kinda big. Yet it is stylish and neat it has a magnet inside to hold your charger. Overall i am happy with it . And highly recommend it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WH-1000XM5 wireless noise canceling headphones are awesome. I’m a satisfied costumer. These block out all the unwanted background noise, especially my fan. The battery life is amazing to. The fit is perfect and comfortable. Great for traveling with hours on top of hours of play and talk time. You can’t go wrong with this purchase.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear headphones everyday for my job , and for fun . I have been threw alot of headphones cheap to expensive, and by far I love these. They are noise canceling, easy to use, Bluetooth, and the best part is if you move them off your ear, it automatically pauses your stuff. So no more having to stop and pause manually which helps especially for my job. I'm love they come with a really nice case, easy-to-use, and carry anywhere. You will love these . The quality alone is so good. Just love them. They last forever before you charge them. The best I say for sure. Obsessed!!"", 'I bought this headphone today and the unboxing to connecting to Bluetooth, setting up the app, to the knowing how to operate the headphone is thrilling', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the Sony noise canceling headphones. They block out noise very well. I love that it has built-in Alexa and I can listen to my favorite music anytime. I never miss a phone call or notification because it will let you know when you have notifications. The built-in Alexa allows you to call someone whenever by simply asking. They fit so comfortably that you could wear them all day if you wish. The cushions are thick and fit snugly around the ears to block unwanted noise. Set up was very simple with easy to follow instructions by scanning the QR code provided. Very well constructed with obvious comfort and convenience in mind. They will come in very handy for us because our back yard is an interstate highway just beginning construction. My husband loves them too and is planning on using them when mowing and weed eating the lawn. They will come in handy when using his chainsaw to trim the many trees in the yard. They will work great for the woodwork he does too. I'm happy they will protect his hearing while working with loud tools and machinery. I will enjoy them while gardening or anytime. I can play music while working around the house without waking my husband when he's working nights. It makes me a happier person while listening to my favorite music. It's so easy by simply asking it to play what I'm in the mood to hear. Sound quality is great. I would recommend the Sony noise canceling headphones because you can listen to your favorite music and never miss a notification or phone call and it blocks out loud noise. It makes life much more enjoyable while protecting your hearing."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After extensive use I can confidently say that Sony’s new WH-1000XM5 headphones are a tremendous leap forward from previous models and the competition.  The headphones themselves feel very sturdy and will not break from minor contact or pressure.  A big improvement from previous models is that these fold flat into their case in a very intuitive and natural manner, whereas older models I experienced required some twisting and I worried each time about exerting too much pressure and causing a break.  The weight seems much improved and even after hours of use I don’t experience any pressure points or fatigue on my head or ears.  My absolute favorite part of the WH-1000XM5 is the noise cancellation, which is superior.  The cancellation is adaptive and filters the majority of ambient or ancillary sounds without the need to run optimization.  For example, other brands I have used may filter the din of traffic and sidewalk sounds but when an ambulance zooms by its siren penetrates the level of active noise cancelling in place causing a startling intrusion of loud sound.  The WH-1000XM5 manages such abrupt changes in ambient sound perfectly and optimizes with immediate recalibration to the active filtration.  I have truly not experienced this level smart adjustment on any other brand or model except for Apple’s top model.  An additional feature that I absolutely love is that the headphones intelligently perceive when they have been removed and pause playback; and when put back on, playback resumes (perfect if responding to a quick question, waiter, etc.).  All of these features combine together to make the WH-1000XM5 my essential traveling companion.  As for sound quality, the WH-1000XM5 is impressive and consistent.  Bass is deep and strong, but not overbearing and never prone to distort.  Highs are crisp but not intrusive – I feel that they were likely tuned with a perfectly flat response, then a slight bass boost applied.  The result is perfect for my listening experience and I never EQ the sound playback that they receive.  In summary, I highly recommend the WH-1000XM5 and am confident that others will be as impressed with the features as I continue to be. ', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones The Sony WH-1000XM5 are so impressive featuring new drivers with flagship superb features and design, active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Fantastic for home, office, travel the list is endless. Optimised for Alexa and Google Assistant. The headphones are covered in a soft coating leatherette they are very comfortable to wear. One of the first things you notice when you open the box is the environmental packaging It's unbleached and wholly recyclable and uses no plastic whatsoever. The headphones are made mostly from Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) which is useful material in acoustic terms which is mostly produced from recycled plastic and can be recycled again at the end of its life. So full marks to Sony for doing this. The Sony WH-1000XM5 main controls use capacitive touch panel on the right ear cup with actions as follows: Swipe Up = Volume Up Swipe Down = Volume Down Swipe Forward = Track forward Swipe Back = Track back Hold (Centre) =Voice assistant Double tap centre= Pause / resume Cup hand =. Ambient sound pass through On the left ear cup you will find two buttons, a power button and ANC mode button.Hold down the power button turns the headphones on after three seconds pairing will start, after that you can pair with your phone/computer. If you press NC/AMB button you can toggle the ANC mode, you are able to select the ANC/ANC off. The Ambient sound mode lets you hear what’s going on around you. You connect the headphones via Blue tooth or a TRS cable. When you listen to the WH-1000XM5 via the wired connection you turn the headphones on and that enables the ANC or leave them off. They sound quite different in passive mode. At the bottom right is a USB-C Charging port that allows you to charge the headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect App works great with these headphones and I highly recommend that you download it. Also you can get the latest updates for your headphones. Battery life for these Sony headphones is approx 30 hours on a full charge, if the battery is flat you can charge for just 3 minutes you will get 180 minutes of playback or of course you can always use the 3.5mm cable for analog playback. The headphones tend too boost the bass a bit too much with a detriment of the midrange however by using the App you can use the equalisation feature to tailor to your liking. These Sony Headphones support Sony’s high bit rate codec called LDAC which gives very good sound quality. On using the wired connection I found the sound performance identical to the wireless mode but you need to make sure they are powered on, if you listen in passive mode performance is not so good. The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones sport 8 microphones and the call quality is good and is excellent on zoom calls or phone meetings. It rejects outside noise well. Overall these Sony headphones are a great buy but expensive, but if you want the best they are definitely worth the outlay."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always look forward to getting new tech. Less so, when I am replacing an item like for like due to a breakdown or fault. Less so too, if I’m just getting an upgrade to an existing piece of kit that I have. No, for me, the real excitement begins when I get a piece of tech that I haven’t owned/used before. Step forth the Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. Sure I’ve had headphones, but not the noise cancelling variety. Resplendent and shiny new in what Sony describe as their environmental packaging initiative. No plastic in the packaging and the Product Box is made using Sony’s Original Blended Material. I took a further look in to this and it appears that the headphones are also made of recycled materials. I don’t tend to buy items based on their environmental credentials, but seeing the attention that Sony are giving to it, it clearly is something that a lot of people care about. I would even go as far as to say, it’s woken me up to the fact and I should be a little more considerate in my buying habits going forward. The first impression you get is one of quality and environmental consideration. Nice one Sony. Once you get inside the box, which is worth keeping to protect your headphones case from future misdemeanours, you are greeted by a further case, this time in a grey hard cloth finish that is attractive and functional. Undoing the gold zipper just helps build the anticipation and once fully opened you aren’t disappointed, though at first sight I am surprised at how little is in the case. But wait, those crafty folk at Sony have worked some magic and as I start to explore I realise that everything I need is in the pack. A discreet flap hides the location of the headphones cable and USB charging cable. The first thing that strikes you is how beautifully styled the headphones are. Everything is colour matched in a quality matt black finish. They’re light and softly rounded rather than futuristically angular.They ooze quality. Considering this was new tech to me, I was a little anxious about understanding and mastering it’s complexities. I needn’t have worried. The sleeve (Again in recycled material) that contains all the documentation shows a QR code that when scanned takes you to a User Manual for the headphones. Next, download the Sony Headphones Connect App. Follow the instructions makes setting up the headphone's simple. Sony have also included a variety of options that allow you to trial for free any one of four music streaming services that provide the 360 Reality Audio Experience. The good news is that the trials are for three months+ in most cases, giving you ample time to trial your chosen service. The concept of the 360 Reality Audio is that instead of you hearing the sound in just a stereo environment it is relayed to you as if you were in your very own musical sphere. I may not have done it justice with my description but I can promise you the most wonderful listening experience. Clarity and depth are the words that come to mind to describe it. To get the best listening experience you have to create your own personalised profile. Again, a really simple experience that involves using an app to guide you. The app assesses the shape of your head and ears that allows the software to build a unique profile to enhance your listening. I saw a TV drama only a few days after I started using the WH-1000XM5’s and the lead character in it said she only listened to her music via headphones. Strangely, that is something I’ve begun doing myself since I got the headphones for all my music listening except when using the radio in the car. The noise cancelling element of the headphones is brilliant. The first time I used them brought back to me a recent flight I took that lasted over four hours. Had I had the headphones then I would have used them to cut out all the background noise on the plane. I fly about five times a year so they will be invaluable to enhance the quality of my journey. In use, the headphones are simple to use. You can do most things by using the touch controls on the right headphone. You can play, stop, pause and skip through tracks while raising and lowering the volume just by moving you fingers in a particular direction. The same actions can be used when taking calls. If you cover the whole right headphone in the cup of your hand the sound is reduced to a mere whisper allowing you to listen more attentively to your surroundings. Combine this with the Ambient or noise cancelling button on the left headphone and you can alter the sound to include the local ambient noise or have noise cancelling on. With music playing you can speak and the sound cuts out allowing you to hear your voice and locality more clearly. Any alerts on your phone are acknowledged with a sound in your headphones to keep you in touch with the rest of your social network. Remove the headphones and the music playback pauses and restarts when you put them back on. So useful. By now you may be beginning to realise how much I’ve fallen in love with my Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelling Headphones. I love them, and can’t believe I haven’t found myself searching them out before. I use them at my computer while working (Even wrote this review while using them). When my wife chooses to catch up on her soaps or talent shows of an evening I slip the headphones on and take myself to the immersive sound experience created by my WH-1000XM5’s. However to conclude this review, a word of warning. When I started using them I found myself moving about the house singing along to the tunes I was listening to. I was having a great time until my enraged red faced wife tapped me on the shoulder and told me to stop the noise. Maybe Sony should put a warning on the packaging discouraging those of us that can’t sing to be mindful of others around us when we use them?"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ## Design - No folding available in this iteration, just the usual cup tilt and pan. Works for me, don\'t mind the lack of foldability. - I personally appreciate the new design and can describe it as far more sturdy and quality feel. No more plasticy sounds when adjusting the headphones or moving your head - The cups are comfortable, with memory foam, coated with some kind of artificial leather - The proximity sensor is no longer visible(compared to M4), but is still there - Headband is comfortable and narrower. However, when at the gym and bench-pressing/dumbbell fly they still slide back off my head. - Approx. 5gr lighter on the scales than previous models. I can\'t really tell the difference when wearing either model, so doesn\'t make a difference to me but appreciate the change. Overall a welcome change. The cups seem a bit thicker in profile than previous iterations but overall with same comfort and nice fake leather coating material. Those are a fingerprint magnet(if you have the black headphones). Yet I prefer this design. The mics are quite visible though and given the grills are the trademark bronze/gold colour they stand out. Not really a fan of that color choice but given what it provides in other departments I have made my piece with it. Might not be for anyone. Definitely though would prefer the mics grills color to be same as the cups color. ## Active Noise Cancelling and mics - 7 visible mics positioned strategically around the ear cup for noise cancelling and voice calls - wind noise reduction is significantly improved (in NC mode only) - while listening and for the other side of a phone call - voice calls recipients no longer complaint about muffled or unclear speech, difference is quite audible. - Adaptive mode is very accurate in changing profiles both action and location based. Super useful in your everyday commute, gym, run/walk and in the office due to personalised ambient sound levels available through the app. You can save frequent locations with predefined ANC/ambient sound levels. Manually entered several of those and all worked well. But that is more on usability and the mobile app, yet worth mentioning. Overall very happy with the improvement in noise cancelling, especially in windy conditions such as the one I encounter every day in my park walks. Gym feeling is the same top notch. ## Buttons, controls and inputs - Same two button operation plus the same gesture controls as before: double tap, swipe up/down/left and right and tap and hold with palm - Still no dedicated button for multipoint connection control. You can pair the headphones with two devices and switch between them but only through the app. I really believe a dedicated button provides far better user experience - Same USB-C charging with fast charging available - Same audio cable provided to connect to your device if you do not want to use wireless - Same touch controls on the right cup, quite responsive and with nice sound feedback ## Connectivity - BT 5.2 - I appreciate that every iteration is supporting the latest BT protocol - Same frequency response as previous models in wired or wireless mode ## Features - Supports most Digital assistants - Google/Alexa/Siri - Connected apps option - chose what connected and supported app to run when double or triple clicking the NC button. I am using Spotify and when double click the NC button music starts playing from that app. - Speak-to-chat feature where once you speak transparency mode is activated until your voice is no longer picked by the headphones mics(5/15/30s or auto timeout). No more sing along in this mode :) - Battery life claimed is same as previous models - around 30h. I managed to get ~22h(100% down to 20%) with adaptive mode on and volume 30-50% . Quite a good deal. It could be different for you based on your prefered volume levels, EQ and NC mode. Worth noting that I received a firmware upgrade(1.1.1) right after the test. ## Sound - Playing the same song with default EQ seem to give this new XM5 a clearer mid-range than previous iterations(XM3 and XM4). For the casual listener I doubt it would make any change. For me personally I always use the EQ to adjust mid-high frequencies and also crank up the Clear Bass to +7. You must hear it for yourself with your favourite track to be able to appreciate the difference. - Quite a big technical change is the new drive - 30mm down from 40mm but with some better insulation and lighter mats such as carbon. Frequency response is same both wired and BT. All that signifies a change in the drive cavity and how bass resonates to produce the same quality low frequencies. - Each and every one of us has slightly different sensitivity for different frequency bands and self preferences as well therefore a head to head comparison of the output over a microphone(with different frequency sensitivity bands and possibly remastered post recording) gives some perspective but is in no way a fair depiction of what you, yourself, might take out of those headphones(or any audio device for that matter) and classify as ""good"" or ""bad"". Overall seem like an improvement(in the mid-range frequencies) and very much so appreciated. An audiofile will definitely hear a difference if comparing with predecessor. I still do and yet I am not a professional audio engineer. Given everything I mentioned, if you had any previous WH1000X model, I can describe this new one as a good step forward. In any other case prepare to be blown away. Coming from the other two brands competing with Sony will still feel very different and an improvement in most aspects. A very welcome upgrade I\'d say - noise cancellation, audio quality, connectivity(with the exception of multipoint management) are all top level. A must have for travel on the tube, going to the gym or for a walk in the park. Adaptive ANC is brilliant. I very much want to see a hardware change for multipoint device management on the headphones themselves. Maybe a dedicated button to switch between connected/registered devices. Also, can\'t wait to see what Sony can offer in future iterations with regards to further improving noise cancelling, especially dynamic wind noise removal and would they offer multi-drive and true DD5.1(that would be amazing!) version of this product one day.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The connection to my new Sony headphones via Bluetooth was extremely easy, the headphones themselves ooze quality and are comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time, this is probably helped by there light weight. The sound quality is out-standing and even when listening to an audio book in a very noisy environment, the noise cancellation works very well, letting you hear just what you want to hear, even the carry case is well designed. So these get a rare 5 stars from me.']"

So loud that I don't turn the volume of the earbuds to there maximum level. The bass hits hard! If you are a lover of bass, you won't be disappointed! There's an equalizer setting from opening the Galaxy variable app. This is where you'll find six presets of normal, bass boost, soft, dynamic, clear, and treble boost.

I suspect I have so it\'s ears but alas, they look ""normal"" to me so there\'s no way to know for sure. I do enjoy the case being able to charge and I bought the pokeball case holder so maybe I won\'t lose these ones. I have dropped the ball (ha!).l once or twice at this point and I was disappointed when the buds went flying out in different directions. This is a review on the buds tho so nevermind that. I like them, but do I $200 dollars like them? No. I think I like them maybe a $100 at best lol', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are some of the best Buds out, especially if you own other compatible Samsung products. I use these daily on the job site, and in the office since I work in IT, and frequently need to take calls and talk hands- free while working. The downloadable Samsung App also gives you so many options, such as notifying you when you have left your Buds behind, and will track and lead you to exact location of them. If you have lost them in a place such as a bed, or couch, or just set them down and can't remember where you left them, they have a noise chirp feature to help lead you to them. Also you can choose between noise cancellation, ambient sound, or both, so if someone is nearby trying to get your attention, they can automatically switch from noise cancellation so you can physically hear them. You can answer and end calls at the touch of the Bud, and the case not only is rechargable and waterproof as are the Buds, but will also charge your Buds when you place them in there. You can also use an equalizer to tone your favourite sounds to your music, and can also skip tracks, pause, or replay them by simply touching the Buds - just the same as answering phone calls. You can even set them to automatically end the call if no voice is heard after 5, 10, or 15 seconds. The battery life for both the Buds and Case lasts extremely long, and can be monitored as well within the app. They also come with a three year warranty if they are new- you just have to register them with Samsung on your account. Five stars hands down the best wireless earbuds I've ever owned! They are a bit more expensive, but you get the quality you pay for. They also have wireless charging capability, equalizers, neck stretch reminders, and so much more. I would also recommend keeping your ears clean since these Buds fit directly in your ears by way of silicone fittings. They come with several sizes of fittings for the perfect fit, and are very easy to change. I also would recommended getting an extra protective case to give them a bit of more protection. It's worth it. Wait until you hear, see, and feel the quality of these Buds and you'll never want any others."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had a pair of these earbuds for 2 years now, and i still use them daily. They might look a little rough now. The nice rubbery overmold finish is almost completely gone. Leaving just a plastic finish. Looks aside they still work great. The battery life is a bit shorter than when i first got them, but for the age still surprisingly good. I listen to podcast and audio books for around 6 hours a day and only charge them 2 or 3 times a week. The noise canceling was amazing before an update about 3 months after I got them , now its just mehh.', 'Received these as a gift close to a year ago exactly. The comfortable fit is just second to none. I was amazed at the sound quality all around. Personally, they sound immensely better than my ""big-brand"" headphones. Never had any problems, enjoyed all varieties of features. A few months ago, I had to let one go due to an accident & less than ideal location. Have yet to find anything that compares for me personally, nearly going as far to say that the 1 Galaxy Bud 2 pro is better for me, than both of anything else haha. Wrapping up, didn\'t know what to expect before trying them, & they ended up being better than I ever imagined.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The galaxy buds 2 pro pack a lot of punch into a small package. As seen in the pics, the case is quite small and quite slim. The matte rubbery finish gives good grip and looks good as well. You can charge with USB-C or wirelessly. Since I have a galaxy S20 FE, I can use the phone to wirelessly top up the case. They are very quick to charge, even wirelessly and last quite a while. I have them in almost all day during work and every few days I give them a quick top up if I'm near my various wireless pads around the house or if I have a cable nearby Set up is easy, as soon as I opened the lid, my phone and laptop both picked them up and wanted me to confirm pairing. When they connect you get a popup showing the charge left in the case and the buds. Very handy to give a heads up when it's time to top up Audio quality is great. Calls come in very clear and the other side hears me really well. They can't tell I was using them vs my headset. Controls are easy to use. Single tap for pause/play, double for skip, triple for previous. I tend to often use only one bud at a time so I can pay attention to others working of needed, and what is great about these is that the commands are the same on both sides. Other sets usually have different controls on either side (ie left is previous/vol down, right is next/vol up) which is annoying when using 1 bud. You can volume control as well, but you have to go into the wearable app and go to lab. In there you'll find the volume enable. Don't like how buried it was. Part of the reason I only keep one bud in, is company policy at work, especially when walking around. Though when I'm sitting I like to put both in because the ANC is fantastic. Blocks out pretty much everything. Ambient is good too, I can hear what's around me clearly, incase I need to be paying attention Fitment is ok. It keeps slipping out of my left ear. I imagine it is something is wrong with my one ear, it may be too shallow where the bud sits. Given how low profile these are, it doesn't sit as well as other styles/brands. However it's only a real issue when I'm doing something active. For those times I'll use a cheaper set that sits better but I don't mind getting knocked around. I'll daily drive these when I'm sitting around."", ""I finally purchased the Buds Pro 2. I've owned multiple Buds in the past, Buds Live being my favorite, & Samsung continues to be the leader in innovation. Buds Pro2 are lightweight, finally waterproof, fit perfect in ear and sound great! Seamless connectivity to my Samsung Neo TV & my S22 Ultra 5G.alactus. My only dislike is I wish they offered more colors. it would be cool to have a red pair. I also like that the graphite color is a matte finish instead of glossy. Cant wait to see the 2023 lineup! #GALAXYGANG #TEAMSAMSUNG""]"
Belkin SoundForm Nano In-Ear Sound Isolating Truly Wireless Kids Headphones - Blue,$29.97,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/belkin-soundform-nano-in-ear-sound-isolating-truly-wireless-kids-headphones-blue/16448431/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Belkin- SOUNDFORM Nano Wireless Earbuds for Kids didn’t work for long. I really wanted to love these and I did at first. They worked incredibly well for my daughter at first. I think for maybe a week or two they worked exactly as they should. Then only one earbud would work and the other one wouldn’t. Then both would work again and then only one would work. Then they would only work when inside the charger. I am not sure why they are “glitchy” but that seems to be what they are. She can’t use them anymore and was really only able to for two weeks. I wish they would have continued to work for much longer because she really loved them at first. They were comfortable in her ears and great. If only…', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got the Belkin - SOUNDFORM Nano Wireless Earbuds for Kids in white for my 9 year old grandson, so he could use it on the computer for homework or for fun. I actually tried it out first and i am amazed by the simplicity of connecting it to devices. the biggest tip size fit me too, it comes with 5 different tip sizes for all sizes. It goes in the ear easy and fits great. The sound and clarity is great. It comes in a great case that is also the charger. Great Product !!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Loved these for my 9 year old who was so excited to try them. They don’t get extremely loud and they hold the charge really well. The box says the buds will last over 4 hours and the charge of the case lasts 17. I’m not sure they really met those times, but they did what we needed them to do. Definitely should have adjusted the ear bud size (which does come in the pack) but we tried these for the first time in the car. Now, one is missing because it fell out of his ear so definitely make sure you size everything properly before use. Definitely recommend to get a kiddo so you don’t have to do AirPods.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been wanting to get my son a pair of earbuds but wasn't quite sure how he'd do. He is Autistic and has sensory issues, especially when it comes to his ears. I came across these Belkin SoundForm Nano Wireless Earbuds and decided to give them a try. These are for kids ages 7 years and older. My son is 8, and even with his sensory issues he's doing great with these! He really seems to like them, and actually leaves them in. They're very comfortable when wearing, and fit his ears perfectly! These came with 4 different earbud tips that can be changed out to fit better. There is an XXS, XS, S, M, L size tips that are designed for smaller ears. One thing I really like with these is, they prevent loudness over 85dB for a safe listening experience. Next, pairing these was very easy! They paired to his tablet and TV within seconds of turning on the Bluetooth. He can control several features from the earbuds. To turn the volume up use the right one, down use the left. Play/pause can be controlled by either earbud. Skip forward, tap the right one 3 times, backwards, tap the left 3 times. To answer a phone call tap twice on the left, to decline tap twice on the right. Lastly, the battery life is fantastic! These hold up over 24 hours on a full 2 hour charge. The charging box comes with the cable, you will need a power source. This is definitely a great quality pair of earbuds for kids. If your child is wanting a pair, I'd definitely check into these."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These ear buds are designed perfectly for kids. They come in an easy to open case that keeps them safe when not in use. They come with different size covers that would fit all ear sizes. The volume is much lower than adult made earbuds. I feel they wouldn’t damage their ears compared to other brands. It’s easy to charge and easy to store the bright colored case. My kids loved them!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ok, so we wanted to really like these, they are for kids so wasn’t exactly expecting lossless audio here. That said, they are average and the sound is acceptable. If they are going to compete with anyone above bottom tier they will not survive. The build of the case is garbage, cheapest plastic available and not just the feel, you can see the cheapness. I’m my son was embarrassed to have them out, and he’s still rocking original AirPods from 2016. Anyway. Three stars is generous, but there forgettable and that’s a shame. These are a swing and a miss, but they’ll do in a pinch.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are light weight and pack a lot of power. The sound control is wonderful. Just loud enough for kids. It comes with 5 different sized tips to change out. It’s designed for kids with small ears. My daughter loves them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds were great for my 10-year-old she especially likes how easy they are to connect. She currently has an iPhone so using Bluetooth makes it so incredibly easy to connect her phone. The music always sounds crisp and has bass but she really likes considering she’s really into Pop music currently. She said her favorite part of these earbuds are actually the color, she loves the color pink. Overall the quality and design of these earbuds are excellent I love the compact ability of the case and the charging is super easy because most people already have the cord sitting around their house.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So I got these originally for my toddler daughter, unfortunately her ears were to small, luckily I have an 11 year old son and they fit just fine! Super comfortable, fast charging, works great for car rides or at home for just chilling. I like that they're made for children's ears so they're not to loud but give them that great sound quality, comes with a compact carrying case that charges the ear bud, micro USB charging cable that connects and charges the earbuds pretty quick, includes 5 sizes of silicone ear tips that should help fit different ears comfortably, so far these have been super durable and no complaints yet!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these earbuds! Yes, I'm an adult, but I have been through dozens of different earbuds with no luck on fit. These are the first ones that have ever fit, and now I know what I've been missing! The way they block out all the extra noise is astounding! They fit beautifully, the sound quality is fantastic, and I am so excited that I actually have a pair of earbuds that finally fit!""]"
Sony WF-C510 In-Ear True Wireless Earbuds - Blue,$69.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wf-c510-in-ear-true-wireless-earbuds-blue/18389315/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very impressed with the packaging with only cardboard and shaped paper no plastic of any type, which is brilliant. Found the buds connected very quickly to my android tablet and Hi Res player and easy to use I headphones app . They only come with one size silicone bud but has no issues and found them comfortable to wear and secure whilst wearing them. I have not tried connecting to mobile yet so cannot comment yet, as I don't normally listen to music etc via mobile. Now the main point the sound and I very shocked in a good way the sound was full of rich bass and treble just right and found the sound field very detailed and impressed in positive way . I cannot find any faults or disappointment."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent set of earbuds. Small and compact with charging case included. They are very comfortable and fit well into my ears. I set them up via the Sony connect app which has lots of nice features and sound adjustments. Sound quality is good with minimal disruption from external noise, I took them on a hike while in Skye and they lasted for hours and still had a fair bit of juice left. Haven’t yet tried them out during fitness but they are water resistant, so sweat shouldn’t pose any issues. Overall, very impressed, can see me taking these everywhere given the small size.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pleasantly Surprised! Amazing value for money, I could not believe the quality of the sound from a set of Wireless Headphones, so competitively priced. The fit was perfect with the buds fitted straight out of the box and they were extremely comfortable and held well in the ear, better than some more expensive Headphones that I have owned previously. Some clever features available within the Sony Headphones Connect App, which I would not have expected at this price point. The Headphones are a nice compact size, likewise the charging case, ideal for commute or travelling. Battery life was good and easily topped up on the go in the charging case. Sony Packaging was compact and all able to be recycled. All in all, an impressive set of Wireless Headphones at this price, I would recommend.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have reviewed the C510 in comparison with Linkbuds S, SP700N, WF 1000XM3 and ULT wear. These C510 are lightweight, the fit very comfortable and they are unobtrusive to wear. These buds pair easily with the headphones app and have all the normal adjustments of the more expensive earbuds The sound is loud and clear but rather raw especially compared to the WF1000 XM3', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are good headphones, and I mean no disrespect when I say that I hadn't expected them to be as good as they are. I think Sony has done a good job with these. I tested them on a range of music (1970s and 1980s mostly, but also jazz) and with radio and podcasts. Unboxing was easy. The safety and compliance documentation, as always, is printed in tiny type, so some people may need a magnifying glass. However, I'm genuinely unsure how many people read this. Setting up took literally seconds: just add them as a Bluetooth device and you're up and running (my experience was in adding them to a MacBook Air and to an iPhone). The user guide can be accessed by using QR code. There is an app to download, but as I already had another set of Sony headphones I already had a copy. I listen to more voice – radio and podcast – than music, and in that category these headphones operate well. I also want to highlight that I have a slight hearing problem (age-related), often having to ask for words or phrases to be repeated. I did not have any hearing problems when using these headphones: all words were intelligible on first listening. The number of button presses causes certain actions to take place, for example four presses of the right button increases volume. The buttons work flawlessly."", ""I got these earphones about two months ago. I love them. They are bassy, loud, light weight (sometimes I forget I'm wearing them) and the battery life is outstanding. I accidentally found out that tapping the right bud four times increases the volume and the left side decrease the volume. Ive also dropped them a couple of times from about waist height, for both the buds themselves and the case but they still m working perfectly without any compromise to the y and no scratches (the case is made of a matte like finish and I haven't found any issues with them. One downside is call quality, it isnt that great especially outdoors in noisy environments such as restaurants, the street and parks. There also isn't ANC but they do a very great job canceling out the noise using passive notice cancellation (I mean just plug them in your ears and they seal perfectly, blocking out outside noise). I also wish I could assign a pause and play function on my left bud in the Sony Sound Connect app, that way I'm not forced to wear my right bud all the time which over time will degrade my battery on the right side more than the left side (I like to balance the use of both sides). I also wish the 360 feature worked for Spotify. Other than that I havent seen any discolouration on the case and buds so far, they're great to listen to podcasts, movies and music on, and they have an outstanding battery life."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The new Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless Headphones now incorporate stunning audio advances with immense benefits for earbud listeners. It goes without saying that they are compact, lightweight, comfortable, unobtrusive, JPX-certified to be sweat and water-splash resistant and come with small, medium, and large, easily interchangeable silicone rubber earbud tips for an absolutely perfect fit. Available in an attractive selection of four colours (black, light blue, yellow and white), they now boast up to twenty-two hours battery life (eleven in the buds themselves and a further eleven hours’ charge in the pocket or hand-bag sized, cylindrical charging case) together with a five-minute quick-charging facility permitting an additional hour’s extended listening if required. Four further, wonderful enhancements include multipoint connectivity for simultaneous playback from two Bluetooth devices so that if you listen to music on one device and a call comes in on another, Sony’s technological magic pauses the music, allows you to respond, then resumes the music automatically. The second feature concerns the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine which ensures high-quality clarity and richness particularly for higher frequency sounds and musical registers. Additionally, when connected to the Sony Headphones Connect App, music and speech can be adjusted precisely to reflect personal, listening tastes and preferences. Thirdly, these earbuds, powered by a highly reliable Bluetooth chip and antenna, transmit sound simultaneously to both ears, rather than employing a more conventional left to right Bluetooth relay transmission. A control button on each headset (pressing, once, twice, three times, together with a hold function) instantly controls music volume, playback, phone calls and advanced voice assistant operations. A forth feature relating to the Ambient Sound external microphones on the earbuds enables listeners always to remain alert to their surroundings. I found pairing the earbuds to be quick, easy, and reliable with Windows ten and eleven desktops and laptops, Apple iMacs, Macbooks, and iPads, and Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and tablets. These earbuds guarantee an outstanding listening experience for all with a crisp clarity of sound and an authentic voice quality for telephone calls, speech, and drama podcasts, and rich and fully immersive stereophony for music, choral and concert hall performances. Optimum help and guidance are best sought from the Sony website and associated videos because the literature supplied is minimal both in content and font size which makes reading and understanding difficult. Nevertheless, while the sound quality will exceed most expectations, the advanced audio technology, versatility, and ease of use of these new earbuds will bring pleasure to all music lovers allowing even those with hearing impairments to enjoy anew cherished listening experiences.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used these ear buds for a week now they're are so much better than the wf c510 witch i have already the sound quality is absolutely amazing . they paired with my phone without a problem. They do not come with any charging cable but they do come with extra ear bud covers. They come really well packaged. Also they are very comfortable in the ear"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WF-C510 have been an inspiration of sound design and battery life. They are so easy to pair once you download the Sony app. I tried them on various devices including my mobile, tablet, laptop and tv. They have an exceptional long battery life, I managed to get 10+ hours and there was still plenty of power left. They are so comfortable to wear and they have good noise cancelling. I can highly recommend them to anyone who wants a quality product for a reasonable price. I use earbuds daily for 8 hours + and wouldn’t hesitate to use these daily. The only negative thing I can say is that they don’t come with a usb lead so you have to purchase one separately. But given the low cost of the earbuds it’s still a great choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very neat earbuds, complete with charger case. They setup with my android Google pixel phone was simple using the free Sony Headphones app. There's a tutorial on the app and an easy to use equaliser tool which adapts to your personal sounds. I tried Vocals and instruments with a clear range and details. I was very impressed with the 3D sound effects. Buttons on the buds gives you control without having to use your device. USB C cord supplied and the initial charge was about 3 hours, the battery life is good. It comes with a selection of ear cushions to enable a close ear fit, and comfort. The case is small easily fitting into a bag or pocket. The case is quality and has a spring closer. I really like these both for comfort and user ease.""]"
Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Wireless Gaming Headset for PC/PlayStation - Black - Only at Best Buy,$109.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-600-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-playstation-black-only-at-best-buy/17933294/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like that they are comfortable and fit perfectly to my head, I love that the battery lasts 80 hours non-stop, I like that it is a wireless connection, the sound is fantastic, super clear and clear, it has a built-in microphone, excellent in precision auditory. A score of 100%, it is made with high quality and resistant materials. And a plus is that it can not only be used to play PlayStation®, Nintendo Switch™, Steam Deck™, but also on PC, and cell phones. I love it...I love my new toy', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The first thing I had to do was charge the Turtle Beach Shealth 600 headphones. I used the included charging cable and the block from my iPhone, It had a nice long cord which I really liked. I hate it when headphones come with a short cord. It seemed to take a long time to charge them the first time. The second time did not seem to take as long. The headset is so comfortable on my head. Not tight nor lose. It does not move around on my head yet it is in no way restrictive. I also like the microphone. It is not so long that it gets in my way. It is just the perfect size. When I am not using it, it stores easily out of sight in a slotted place on the headset. Totally out of sight. The ear part is so soft. Feels like my pillow. It moves from side to side to get that perfect fit. I do love the feel and comfort of it. I had to make sure my headset was updated with the latest firmware by scanning the code found in the instructions. It took me straight to the APP Store and the APP Swarm II. Sure enough there was a mandatory update. So I attempted to update that. I did have problems with that but after some time I managed to accomplish that. Once I had the update completed It was so easy to reconnect to the computer using the USB Wifeless Transmitter. I also added it to my iPad and iPhone using blue tooth. It was so easy. I just had to turn on Bluetooth on my iPhone and then turn on the headset, For some strange reason I had hold down the Bluetooth button and the Quick Switch Button at the same time then it paired perfectly. I like to carry my headphones with me when I travel. So I was disappointed that this came without a case to carry it in. I do not like to just leave my headphones laying on the bed in a motel or on the car seat while I go in somewhere to eat. I need a case to store it in out of sight. If it had a case I would have rated this a 5 star.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 Quick Overview ================================= There are a tons of choices in all different price brackets to consider when shopping for gaming headsets. At this price point, there\'s especially fierce competition from major brands like Logitech and Steel Series, to smaller/niche ones like Nacon\'s RIG line of headsets. Now we\'ll look at Turtle Beach\'s latest version of their multi-platform wireless headphones, the Stealth 600 Gen 3. Overall build ================================= Plastic may not be the most premium material, but there are certainly varying degrees of quality. Here, Turtle Beach has some very nice, dense, matte-finished plastic that definitely doesn\'t feel cheap. The earcups are a soft cloth with an even softer memory foam padding inside the for maximum comfort, even for those who wear glasses. In the box, you\'ll also get the 2.4 Ghz USB-A dongle, a charging cable (USB-A to USB-C). The dongle itself is small and I\'m a bit surprised it\'s USB-A only, but that\'s fine since I suppose we\'re all still making the transition. There are no controls on the right earcup, so everything is on the left including the flip-out boom mic. Starting from the front where the flip-to-mute mic is, there\'s a power button with a ring that lights up while charging, a Mode button, and the BT button (hold down to pair). To the rear there\'s a master volume knob and a chat/game mix knob, each with a differently knurled finish to differentiate by touch. Lastly there\'s a Quick Switch button by the USB-C charging port which can flip between BT audio and the 2.4 Ghz dongle. It\'s a nice touch and works with just a half-second press. The headphones have quite a few clicks of adjustment and even on my med-large head, it only required about 4-5 clicks on each side out of the 10-11 maximum. Initial setup ================================= I let it charge for a few hours so I could properly test it. The circular ring surrounding the power button glows red while charging then turned off when it was ready. I wanted to make sure they were fully charged, so I connected it to a USB-C charging cable and waited. After plugging in the dongle, I was ready to go from a ""default Windows sound"" perspective, but I figured I should download the software. Here\'s where things went a bit awry and I think TB could make the process smoother. I downloaded their Swarm II software and installed it. During that time, it noticed my headset was connected and there was an update available for both the dongle and the headphones. Great! I let it update and after that I was having issues connecting. Though I could hear Windows audio, the app itself (Swarm II) couldn\'t see the headphones so I couldn\'t customize it. I decided to try BT mode and also test the mobile app at the same time. BT pairing was easy enough. I just held down the BT button and selected it on my phone (Pixel 8 Pro) when it popped up. I then installed the Turtle Beach Swarm II app from the Google Play store and saw it had a lot of EQ and other parameters to tweak. It looked nice enough and showed my firmware was up to date. I then switched back to ""Wireless mode"" (that\'s what the audio prompt says) and the Windows Swarm II app still couldn\'t see my Stealth 600 Gen 3s! I decided to reboot and when I came back online, my headphones appeared in the Swarm II app! Yay? Well, after firing it up again, it said I had another update - this time for Waves for 3D audio. I let it install that and rebooted once more. After that, Swarm II prompted for yet another firmware update for the dongle and headphones! After going through this process one more time (and another reboot), I was finally able to see more options in the Swarm II app including EQ modes, Macro, and fine-tuning of the different buttons and knobs that could be reprogrammed. Overall, it\'s nice to have this much customizability! I worry that some other less-persistent PC users may have given up before this point, because I\'m leaving out a lot of power toggling, USB dongle disconnect/reconnecting, and rebooting. Now that we were ready to go, I was finally ready to play some games and listen to music! Performance ================================= The mic is actually very good. It\'s much better than I expected! I record audio for technical marketing videos and repair videos online with a dedicated ""Australian Mic Manufacturer\'s"" mic and this TB Stealth 600 Gen 3 nearly matched it. I\'d say most people may not notice the difference! I was impressed and I also like that I could configure things like the ""noise floor"", sensitivity, and more in the app. For testing the sound, I listed to multiple FLAC and Spotify songs that I knew very well and that I\'ve tested with ""audiophile"" headphones/amps and other gaming headphones. I also played some Sniper Elite 4 and Cyberpunk 2077. Overall, I\'d call these headphones more accurate than they are musical, and that\'s OK! If gaming is your thing, I think these headphones are probably superior to the more musical ones. Sure, a lot of people like powerful, booming bass when it comes to music or watching movies, but when it comes to sneaking around as a sniper in WWII, you want detail. These Stealth 600 Gen 3s are super-clear and what they may have lacked in pure bass output, they made up for in clarity and resolution. I really liked these in Sniper Elite 4 as they helped me really focus on what was going on. Superhuman hearing was also a very nice option (as it has been w/TB for years), but it\'s hard to say if it helped a ton in this game because the clarity really helped me hear the details I might have missed with other headphones. In Cyberpunk 2077 these also performed really well. Yes, CP2077 benefits from powerful, musical headphones with its soundtrack and action scenes, but there\'s also a ton of detail in Night City and you can hear it with these Stealth 600 Gen 3s. Musically, I think the biggest thing I missed was the bass/sub-bass but overall these are great headphones for gaming and music because of their detail and resolution. Even tweaking the EQ to boost the bass can\'t get it up to the same levels as some bass-heavy favorites, but again - these are very pleasant and accurate. Conclusion ================================= I\'ve had the pleasure of testing multiple wireless gaming headphones over the years from the PS3 era to the best and newest ones that include an HDMI switcher! These headphones are surprisingly one of my favorites! I typically like some extra ""oomph"" in the lower registers since bass in music and movies can make things more exciting and fun, but I love the accuracy of these! Not only that, they don\'t distort if they can\'t hit the low frequencies (unlike some other headphones I\'ve had). Everything from PC, to Android, to Steam Deck to Spotify was clear and accurate. Barring the initial setup hassles, I\'d recommend these if you\'re focused on gaming first and music/movies second.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones have a variety of pros and cons. The pros: they are super comfortable. The ear pads are cushiony and the top is soft as well. The battery life is very impressive, I used it for at least 18 hours and they’ve still got plenty of charge left. They just feel generally good quality and are nice to wear. I will also say that I enjoy that they can go between Bluetooth and usb direct connection. The Bluetooth definitely works better than the usb in terms of quality when listening. Specifically, listening from a phone sounds great. They are easy to control for volume and otherwise. The charging is also using a usb-c cord, which is pretty convenient to find these days. Unfortunately there are some cons as well to these that bring the rating down to 3 stars. The cons: the wired connection from usb has more static than other pairs of headphones I have used, which takes away from the overall gaming experience. Additionally, if using these with Bluetooth to a pc, there is slight lag from whatever you are doing. Additionally, the microphone is probably a 6/10 as far as quality goes. Overall decent pair of headphones that are comfortable with a long battery life and an easy ability to toggle between Bluetooth and usb connection.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First, I'll start with the good things. The sound quality is amazing, it has a strong handle. Also the ears have some cushions that stop me from getting earaches. Now, for the reason I rate it so low. When I tried to connect it says it's compatible with mobile on the box but when I tried to connect with my phone it was not working. It showed up but I couldn't connect with my phone. I tried with my gaming laptop. It was only able to connect with the USB through wireless, even when I changed the mode to Bluetooth the video would keep playing and there wouldn't be any sound. I even tried with my iPad the same thing happened. Now I can't even update it."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Right off the rip I have to say these new stealth 600 series gen 3 maintain the old tried and true fitment of years past so if you enjoy any turtle beach headset this one will also fit great but if you have even a remotely larger head (think like L/XL flex fit needed) it will have a higher clamping force and I recommend you check these out at your local Best Buy display to ensure fitment. That said im part of the clamp crew though they do stretch with time. The stealth 600 series from turtle beach is by far the most recognizable name in gaming headsets. This new gen 3 style for 2024 really steps the bar up by adding bluetooth functionality to the already stellar 2.4ghz wifi connection. This particular model can connect easily to PC, playstation, switch, and mobile via low latency wireless or bluetooth depending. The new AI based mic noise reduction and echo canceling is actually a lot better than last years model I also have which is nice my friends noticed the difference right away. This has the newer 50mm nanoclear drivers which sound full and up front so you can hear foot steps well with the right EQ settings. Speaking of EQ settings you can customize the 3d audio settings, EQ, mic settings and everything else right in the Swarm II desktop or mobile app. Beyond fitment the athletic weave fabric ear cups are a hate it or love it type of deal and personal preference. The real choice on that is these allow your ears to breath well over a long period of time but they dont keep sound in that well if your trying to be discrete. The mic flips up to mute which is a turtle beach classic and much appreciated. Another appreciated thing is the ability to lay these flat on your desk and the ear cups swivel to allow. There is switches on the ear cups for mode, a new quick switch button to swap between 2.4ghz wireless and bluetooth modes which only takes a couple seconds to connect. Overall you cant ask for much more value for the money here on a wireless pair these days. I wouldnt hesitate to pick up a pair (unless you have a large head then try them on first lol).', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Turtle Beach Stealth 600 has impressive sound paired with practical controls and above average wireless distance coverage. But first: What in the box: -Charging cable USB-A to USB-C, USB A Dongle, Haadset Connections: - Bluetooth 5.2, 2.4GHz Wireless Hardware Controls: 1. On/Off button / Superhuman Hearing 2. EQ Mode 3. Variable Mic-Monitoring on Play Station and PC Version 4. Master Volume 5. QuickSwitch Button (switch between Wireless and Bluetooth) 6. Connect Bluetooth 7. USB-C Port Paring: Pairing process has been simple at first attempt. Connection with Dongle or via Bluetooth, was able to complete immediately and didn’t take second trial. Using the controls: The controls are dedicated hardware buttons for each function. Unlike the trend in different brands that is based on touch or sensors requiring several taps to perform the action, with Turtle Beach Stealth 600 that process feels more accurate and easier or more effective. To increase the volume for instance, it just takes rolling the dial. Or switching from bluetooth connection to wireless just takes a press in a separate button. As result, it is just about remembering the buttons rather than how many times to tap for each functionality. EQ Mode / Sound Experience: EQ comes pre set of Signature Sound, Bass Boos, Bass & Treble Boost, and Vocal Boost. They are all exceptional modes depending on each situation of game. It is clear and crisp that impressed me as comparing to twice more expensive headsets. It can feel the little sound effect created on the rear to the front as objects and shooting for instance happening on the diagonal direction while instantly others details popping up in the screen and still synchronized simultaneously. Then using for conference call and listening video recording works perfectly well without dropping of connection or latency during long call. Wearing it: The cup covers very well such to isolate external noise much as possible. Sound from the street nearly can be felt as I have used near the street with construction and lawnmowers works in progress. And probably the experience vary depending on how big is the user, but as small ear I have, the cup sits nicely without causing pain on the ear and feels comfortable. Connectivity It can be connected via Bluetooth and/or Dongle USB-A. Every connection being done, a voice tells which one being connected. Mic Activating it is based on expanding the mic or same as unmute. As unmute, it generate beeps sound to indicate such mode being activated, and same for mute mode by flipping back. In summary, the headset from Turtle Beach Stealth 600 is made for gamers that provide exceptional sound as crisp and with nicely synchronized sound effects, and reasonably good sound isolation from external context and noise cancellation. It only require memorize position of buttons, and only in one button to Single/Double/Triple press for Media Playback Play/Pause/Next Track/Previous Track, Accept/Reject/End Call/ Incoming Calls. Wish it were better: 1. Little lighter 2. Bit Less pressure to ears 3. More explosive sound effect during the game. Although it has reasonable bass, in more explosive scenarios feels to comes bit short. 4.

Skullcandy Hesh ANC Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - White,$119.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/skullcandy-hesh-anc-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-white/14899376/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use these headphones all day. I’m obsessed with the comfort, quality sound and noise canceling. I actually hadn’t noticed the low droning sound in the gym, until after I turned off the noise canceling. I have even used the headphones for the noise canceling alone when over stimulated at the end of the day with 3 small kids. I like the white color with the tan ear pads. It looks classy. I like that the logo is subtly displayed. The charge lasts days for daily use, hours on end. I love these headphones and have already recommended them to friends.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Keeping in mind Skullcandy produces decent, mid-tier headphones, these Hesh ANC headphones are probably on the higher end of their mid-tier products. Upon opening, I was pleasantly surprised to see the color scheme was presented well and didn't look tacky. The earpads are nice and cushy, and are comfortable for wearing for a few hours at a time. I love the ability to use both wired and wireless. Hinge design makes for easy storage. They're definitely noise-cancelling, and do provide good acoustics. Only thing I'm worried about is the plastic finishing on the headband portion. I want to wear these to the gym but I'm worried the white won't stay white for long. Overall good quality headphones and happy to have it."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These wireless headphones are awesome. They're very comfortable, easy to use and you can easily take them on the go because they can be collapsed. The battery lasts a long time. I used them for hours for over a week and didn't need to charge them. The noise canceling works great.I love the tile feature thats included but I haven't used it yet (thankfully haven't had to). I definitely would recommend them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I chose these Skullcandy Hesh ANC Over-Ear Headphones to help me have better focus while I work. They truly have an active noise-cancelling feature that blocks out almost all background noise. I love how comfortable these headphones are. There is a memory foam pad on the top that rests on your head while wearing the headphones. There are also circular memory foam pads that surround the ears. The battery life on a single charge is 22 hours, which is crazy! The microphone is also stellar - it actively cancels out background noise, so that whoever you are speaking to can hear you crystal-clear. I also love that it has a built-in Tile tracker so you can keep this investment safe. These headphones also come with a short USB-C to USB charging cord, but no AC adapter to plug it into. You will likely want to invest in a longer charging cable so it's easier to charge at your desk. I never expected to love these headphones so much! These are way more comfortable than the in-ear ones."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love Skullcandy, haven't tried a bad pair of headphones or earbuds from them in the 15 years I've been using their products, and these headphones are no exception. First of all I love the design, in real life the white color is more of an eggshell shade which looks great with the brownish cuffs. These are comfortable, with decent size adjustment options and padding for the top of your head, and they're easy to wear for several hours in a row. The sound quality is great, with an emphasis on bass that I liked. The battery lasts a long time and holds a charge well. I really appreciate that like all of their other headphones I've tried, these charge via USB-C (as opposed to micro-USB or something proprietary which seems to be the norm for a lot of headphones). Really these are just fantastic headphones through and through, and they feel high quality too. I have two small complaints however: the headphones come with a carrying pouch, which is extremely flimsy and thin. I think for the price point, these should come with something more protective, like a hard case or even just a pouch made from thicker material. Lastly, I don't like how these can't connect to the Skullcandy app like some of their other headphones. That app provides neat options such as EQ stuff, and again, for the price point, I don't see why these don't have that extra functionality. But overall I'm so happy with these headphones that neither of those issues are that big of a deal to me. Can highly recommend these and anything else the company puts out."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My husband has a pair of noise canceling headphones that he swears by and when we planned an international trip, it was time for me to get a pair. These Skullcandy headphones were perfect for me. The ear pieces are soft, comfortable, and fit my ears well. The noise canceling works great! It's amazing how much white noise there is in the average environment. My husband said that the sound quality wasn't quite as good as the ones he has, but I don't have any complaints! The battery life lasts as advertised (~20 hrs), and they recharge quickly.

Razer Kaira Pro Dual Wireless Gaming Headset for PS5,$159.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/razer-kaira-pro-dual-wireless-gaming-headset-for-ps5/17213282/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When it comes to a gaming headset, undoubtedly, Razer is one of the famous brands that attracts me to invest my bucks into gaming or computer peripherals. First, I\'m into the Razer ecosystem. Second, I\'m immensely fond of Razer quality and its ongoing innovation in releasing new accessories that catch up with the evolving technology. This Kaira Pro headset is well made and has premium quality blended into many features that enable it to stand out from other options available in the market. It has a nice wearing feel and does not apply pressure to my head, even for long gaming sessions. The design is stunning and matches the color of the PS5, just like it is a Sony-designed product. Most importantly, it is a multi-platform headset. It is equipped with Bluetooth and USB 2.4 dongle capability, making the connectivity to PS5, PC, Nintendo, and any Bluetooth-enabled smartphones and tablets a much-needed headset. But the game-changer is the hyperdense haptic feature and the RGB Chroma. However, the RGB is subtle but still my favorite feature. The HyperClear mic is amazingly clear and detachable and provides noise isolation. The other nice feature this Razer Kaira Pro has is the ""SmartSwitch,"" which allows the headset to be connected to two devices and switch between them by pressing the dedicated button on the headset. However, it does allow the headset to be connected to Bluetooth and dongle simultaneously. Although this headset delivers the most needed functionality, configuring it is a bit bummer unless I leave it to default. The audio is configurable via Razer audio app on the smartphone, but NOT on the PS5 console. Few adjustments can be done through the smartphone app, such as EQ and Do not Disturb to block incoming phone calls besides gaming mode and Smart Link to connect to BT. But, to customize the RGB, there is a separate app called Razer Chroma RGB which to me is a hassle and does make sense to have two different apps to customize this headset. The music and gaming experience was impressive. I connected it via BT to my iPhone and listened to music, and I could tell it sounded great. Gaming is where Kaira triumphed for the clarity of sound and effects that I could hear around my head. Impressive headset, and I hope Razer will release a new app that combines the headset configuration in one app.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Razer Kaira Pro has been an impressive headset that I have absolutely loved for gaming and listening to my various forms of media. These are gamer headphones for a sound and haptic sensation like nothing I have ever experienced before. I didn't realize how much I would love the Razer HyperSense for its haptic ability. This set of headphones is compatible with PC, Mobile, PS5, and PS4. I love the look of these white headphones as they look upscale and modern at the same time. The frost white contrasts with the black and the LED Razer logo color of your choosing. The supercardioid mic is detachable which I really like, so I can plug it in only when I want to game. Otherwise I can use these headphones for listening to music or streaming movies without having a microphone in the way. The mic on this is really nice and gives nice voice isolation that helps to have my voice heard clearly when gaming. The haptics built into the earcups is intriguing and takes you by surprise. The haptics are paired with natural lifelike sensations when gaming with the Intelligent Digital Signal processing. The audio on these headphones is deep, rich, and produces great clarity. I have been using these headphones for more than just gaming because the Razer Triforce Titanium 50mm are out of this world. With the app you can customize the sound to your choosing and adjust highs, mids, and lows individually. There are also preset sound options available that all sound really nice depending on your preference. I have been using these headphones paired via Bluetooth with my iPhone and they sound great for music and media. There is also the USB-C dongle which allows for a connection to your computer or gaming system. The earcups are cushioned very well with the plush leatherette memory foam and can be worn for hours without any discomfort. Battery life comes in at almost 50 hours without any haptics or LED lighting, and about 11 hours of battery life if you are using all the lighting and haptic effects. On the ear cups there are lots of buttons and dials that are easy to learn. Left cup has the power button / pairing, volume control dial, and microphone mute. The right cup has the Razer Smartswitch button, Razer Hypersense button, and Sidetone wheel. The headband is adjustable and padded in the top center for hours of comfortable usage. There are also a couple of Razer apps you'll want to install on your smartphone so you can control your headphones from your device. PRO: Style Comfort Big sound Haptic sound CON: None"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Razer Kaira Pro wireless gaming headset was designed for PlayStation (both 5 and 4 compatible, along with PC and mobile devices) and the black and white color scheme it comes in is aesthetically perfect for the PS5. The PS version contains “HyperSense” functionality which is a haptics-based system designed to add accurate positional information in games. It also functions in other media including movies and music. The construction is mostly a high quality textured plastic, with some brushed metal trim on the headband that appears to be mostly cosmetic in function, but does add a higher-end look and feel to the headset. The headband has a cloth-covered, padded area in the middle where it rests on the top of your head, and the ear cups are spacious with memory foam padding covered in soft vinyl and cloth. I could find nothing in the product’s documentation stating that the ear cup pads are replaceable, nor did I find any replacement parts listed (not even the foam microphone “windscreen”) - this could become an issue for those gamers that are hard on equipment. Comfort is a highly subjective thing, but being an eyeglass and hearing aid wearer, my ears are quite busy during the day. Like I said before, the ear cups are generously sized without appearing huge, and the foam that Razer uses I found to be both compliant and comfortable even during gaming sessions a few hours long. I did find that the ear cup pads do make a squeaking or rubbing noise on the bows of my glasses when I move my head around and that noise is heard inside the ear cups. All other headsets and headphones I have tried do the same thing and the noise does not happen when I take my eyeglasses off. The microphone boom is a flexible stalk that allows you to position it where you need to and will bend out of the way if you bump into it. While it does disconnect from the left ear cup by pulling on it (it is held in place by the two-conductor 3.5mm mini phone plug), it does not conveniently store away like some competitor products that can be pushed into the ear cup or folded against the ear cup. It appears there is a built-in mic on the left ear cup that I assume is intended for you to make phone calls without using the boom mic. My wife did tell me that it was harder for her to hear me if I used the headset without the boom mic than it was if I used my cell phone without the headset and just used the phone’s mic. I can find no mention in the documentation if this hole in the ear cup is indeed a microphone or not. I can only assume it is because why else would you make the microphone boom detachable? When you take off the foam windscreen from the boom mic, you see that there are two distinct “sides” to the microphone, one is the mic’s diaphragm and the other is an air vent. The plug at the base of the boom has a flat spot on it so that you can insert the mic boom into the jack on the ear cup in only the proper orientation so that the mic diaphragm side of the boom ends up facing your mouth. The headset comes packed with a USB-A to USB-C charging cord, with the USB-C end plugging into the headset - thank you Razer for using USB-C so that I don’t have to squint at the port looking for proper orientation of the plug as with micro-USB. The cord is a good-sized 52 inches long and of a nice quality. The 2.4 GHz transmitter (dongle) that plugs into the PlayStation or computer has a USB-C plug on it so it can plug into the front port on a PS5, AND the plug is offset to one end of the dongle so that it doesn’t obstruct the front USB-A port on the PS5 like some dongles for other headsets do. If the device you need to plug this transmitter into doesn’t have a USB-C port (such as a PS4) Razer also includes a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable that is 20 inches long to make things easy to hook up. Very nicely done, Razer. While the sound quality of the Kaira Pro is not on par with audiophile headphones when using them for music, the frequency profile matches nicely with what is needed for gaming for the sonic effects of the game and the voice clarity needed for team activities. The haptics that rumble in the ear cups compliment in-game activities nicely. There are five different sound equalization profiles that you can switch between using a button on the right ear cup and one of them is a 10-band graphic equalizer to allow you to custom tailor the sound to your liking. The user controls are spread between both ear cups rather than having them all crammed onto one like some manufacturers do. There is a mix of push buttons, thumb wheels, and a slide switch to allow you to easily tell them apart by feel. Only one button serves multiple functions and that one will toggle between the wireless connections, the 2.4 GHz dongle used for PlayStation and PC connections and Bluetooth used for connecting to a smart phone for either gaming or phone calls. This button also cycles through the five EQ settings I mentioned previously. There is a dedicated button on the right ear cup to cycle through the HyperSense (haptic) vibrations - low, medium, and high intensities and disable. The user guide states that the HyperSense intensity can be custom tailored in the audio app, but I could not find this feature in any of the menus or settings - maybe it is coming in a future firmware update. There are two smartphone apps that allow you to customize features of the headset. One is “Razer Audio” and the other is “Chroma RGB”. The audio app lets you customize the one EQ setting and also to cycle through all of the settings, block incoming calls while gaming via the 2.4 GHz dongle, turn Smart Link on and off (this is for gaming on a mobile device via Bluetooth), and turn the lighting on the ear cups on or off (referred to as Chroma Effect). The “Chroma RGB” app gives you the ability to customize the lighting effects seen on the outside of the ear cups. Colors can be adjusted, four different types of effects can be chosen, and you can adjust the brightness of the logo (three intertwined snakes - I’m not a snake fan, so mine is turned off) on the ear cups. Naturally, using the lighting effects and the HyperSense rumbling will shorten the battery life. Razer claims up to 50 hours of play time without these effects and up to 20 hours with them enabled. The Razer Kaira Pro sits at the top of the Razer gaming headset price range along with a couple other of their models. About the only thing missing is active noise cancelling. I can’t imagine anyone being disappointed with the feature set this model contains.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] BOTTOM LINE: As much as I love Razer\'s unapologetically over-the-top sense of style & gaming esthetic in their PC & console accessories, I was left cold by the Kraken, Nari, & Blackshark headsets for comfort, sound, or software issues. I converted when the Barracuda X came out of nowhere to turn in some incredibly capable gaming & multimedia performance without some of the issues I experienced in the past. Now the Kaira Pro enters with a few other tricks up its sleeve including haptics, RGB, & multi-console/platform compatibility. Razer REALLY impressed once more with an outstanding headset that offers a compelling mix of style, sound, performance, usability, features, & comfort...DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED! PROs: - This is my fourth Razer headset, & nearly the 30th I\'ve tried from the likes of HyperX, Logitech, Turtle Beach, Audeze, Astro, Corsair, Steelseries & others. The Kaira Pro easily places in the top tier of that crowd by turning in a very engaging & immersive soundfield with sound quality that is also conveniently well-suited for music & videos. They are not hyper-accurate to the point where they might sound harsh or fatiguing, nor are they so overblown & bloated that they feel muddy or boomy (unless you want to EQ that low). - The big draw here, aside from matching the PS5 colorway, is the Hypersense tactile feedback. I was skeptical as to how compelling I would find the effect—but it really does add some additional immersion when the in-game action heats up. At the low setting, it simply feels like a decent, chest-rattling subwoofer is in the room—the added bass “kick” or “oomph” is positively palpable. It was also effective/enjoyable for music & videos because it livened and thickened up the soundstage. At the mid-level setting, you can really “feel it” when you take damage or deliver a powerful attack; it was a heck of a lot of fun & immediately noticeable/less preferable when I turned the effect back off! Some people may enjoy the maximum setting, but I found it fatiguing over time & required multiple breaks--YMMV. - The sound profile has 4 built-in presets: \'Default\'--the most listenable & ""fun"" of the bunch; \'Enhanced Bass\'--self-explanatory, though once you add in Hypersense feedback, I found it a bit too much; \'Amplified\'--basically boosts everything & was not very pleasant to my ears; & \'FPS\'--for enhanced detection of subtle environmental cues--probably best only when needed due to the unnatural treble emphasis. If you pair your headset with a smartphone, you can also use the Razer app & its 10-band EQ to create a custom profile you can save to the headset\'s memory. - Connectivity options include Bluetooth & 2.4 Ghz wireless via included USB-C dongle. There is also a USB-A to USB-C cable included, but it is for charging only. Using the wireless dongle I could venture 3 rooms away--more than 80 feet & around 2 corners--from my console & PC before any dropouts. In Bluetooth, you can also engage ""Gaming Mode"" which uses a lower-latency connection for less A/V lag. I though A/V lag was already minimal; and while the improvement in Gaming Mode was *barely* perceptible, it still seemed to help soundtracks align with onscreen action & lip movements just a hair. - RGB! RGB! RGB! The Chroma app (you don’t need the huge Synapse client, thankfully) allows you to customize the RGB logos on each earcup. You can’t set each independently, but you can adjust the logos to no color, static, breathing, rainbow, & sound meter which flashes the logos in time with the soundtrack/intensity. - Kudos to Razer for taking pains to make the headset user-friendly so you can activate the controls by feel without much overlap. There are separate volume wheels for headset & sidetone, but each is on a different earcup so you won’t fumble for one & accidentally adjust the other. The same goes for the power switch & Hypersense button—both are shaped similarly but are on the bottom of opposite earcups. The mic control is a slider switch on the left earcup while the EQ/Mode adjust control is a button on right earcup. The headband is marked with hashes & numbers so you can readjust to size without manual corrections every time. - The headset is light--344g w/the mic (332g without), yet inward clamping pressure was still enough to keep it firmly in place without becoming too overbearing. Earpads are a glasses-friendly memory foam wrapped in leatherette while the underside of the headband features soft foam padding with a mesh fabric covering. Surprisingly, my ears did not get overly hot despite the nonporous padding, & I was able to wear the headset for several hours at a time without any hotspots or needing constant readjustment. - Razer promises battery capacity, especially when haptics & RGB are off, should last up to 50 hours. I haven’t had any gaming sessions THAT long, but I did not notice any inordinately fast battery drain, although turning up haptics with RGB cranked to full brightness meant I needed a recharge after about 3-4 days. A spoken indicator will let you know when the battery runs low, but you can also check level by percentage in the Razer app. - Mic response has typical vocal frequency cutoffs below 100Hz & above 10Khz. I wouldn’t want to record a studio album with it, but the mic is MORE than adequate for clear multiplayer chat without voices sounding watery or over-processed. - In Bluetooth mode, the power button serves overtime via single, double, & triple presses for play/pause, call answer/hold/reject, skip tracks, & BT pairing. It’s a lot to remember; but being able to take calls or control playback remotely makes this headset a more suitable all-arounder. CONs: - As nice as the voice prompts are, two were sorely missed. One: mic status. There is no audible tone or spoken indicator for muting the mic--the mic mute switch does show a hint of red on the slider when engaged, but the switch is on the back of the earcup. Two: Hypersense/haptics level. One of three rising tones indicates intensity (1-3) while a series of falling tones indicates Hypoersense is off--a spoken indicator of the current setting would have been helpful. - The adjustable boom mic has an idiot-proof socket to ensure the diaphragm rather than the air vent is facing your mouth once the boom is installed, but the only way to mute the mic is to flip the tiny switch at the back of the left earcup; there is no shortcut tap/button or raise-to-mute. It’s a decent tradeoff for being able to remove the mic entirely, but you’ll likely have to fumble around just a bit to find the mute switch. - It was nice not to have to install Razer’s Synapse client on a PC to make RGB adjustments, but it would be nice if Chroma RGB wasn’t separate from the Razer Audio app which is necessary for things like setting power-off delays or custom EQ. Speaking of RGB, Razer estimates that RGB along with haptics may cut runtime as much as 60-80%! - I could stream Bluetooth on my iPhone 12 up to 24-bit/44-kHz, but Windows reported the USB dongle locked at 16-bit/48kHz. This is VERY good audio quality (DVD-level), but falls short of higher definition bit-depths/sampling rates. - The earcups fold flat making it easier to pack, but it’s still a big headset & there is not even a cloth sack to keep the headphones, mic, dongle, cable, etc. together. The recessed USB-C cutout on the left earcup also means that some 3rd party cables won’t fit into the charging port because the connector will be too wide/thick. - The all-plastic construction feels just a tad “light”; it is hard to know how much punishment this headset will take over time. Tolerance between moving parts is also just a little “sloppy”—the hanger pivots flex & bend just enough that they can get hung up on the edges of the headphone hanger creating friction or even creaking/light snapping noises when pivoting/adjusting the headset while donned. I have tried to show this gap in the attached photos. It’s not hugely intrusive, but it happens enough to make me take notice. - The dongle\'s asymmetrical design allows access to the PS5’s front USB port, but if you plan to use the dongle for Switch or PC audio, the paddle will sit a bit off-center which may or may not impact other ports or ergonomics. - Unlike the round & oversized earcups on something like the Krakens, the Kaira Pro features a slightly tilted oval-shaped earcup & opening to better accommodate the natural shape of the outer ear. While the earpads do feature some generously sized openings, they are still not quite large enough to be considered circumaural for many adult-sized ears. If you are sensitive to the feeling of on-ear headphones, note that at least a portion of the earpad will still rest on some portion of the surface of the ear itself.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve owned multiple Razer products, including headsets, and I’ve loved everything from that company. I was excited for the Kaira Pro because I loved the idea of force feedback in the headset. However, while I desperately wanted to love this headset, I cannot recommend it, especially at this price point. I should note that you can use this headset with PC, PS5 or as a Bluetooth headset for your phone. I myself used it only for my PS5 and phone. IN THE BOX The box is compact and protects the headset. Inside is the headset, the microphone (which is removable, it plugs in what I will call an audio jack), the USB-C wireless adapter, a USB-A to USB-C charging cable and a USB extending cable. In typical Razer fashion, all of the cables are braided and high quality. DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY As I said, the Kaira Pro is built well like virtually all Razer products. It’s made mostly of plastic which keeps it light, but it feels premium. The ear cushions are large and feel extremely comfortable. It just feels nice for lack of a better word. It looks great as well, matching the PS5 aesthetics. It’s white and black on the outside and blue is inside the ear cups. It looks great. There are a lot of buttons and several dials on the headset. I found them a little daunting at first, because when I was using them I forgot what buttons did what and I had to find them by feel, but after a little time, I memorized where everything was. There’s a dial for side tone (so you can hear yourself) the volume, slide button to mute microphone, a button to switch between headset and connect to your phone and yet another button to turn on/off the RGB lights and rumble features. I’ll just add that it’s extremely comfortable to wear, which is a plus. FEATURES This comes packed with features. I mentioned sidetone, which I’m a big fan of, as well as the ability to switch between your phone (if you get a call) and your PS5. But the one that gave me the most excitement - and ultimately disappointment - was the vibration feature in the headset. I love the rumble features in the Dualshock 5 and was excited to experience it in the headset. Another small feature is the audio cues when you’re turning it on/off or changing audio profiles. When you turn it on a voice tells you the power is on, and when you switch the audio profiles, you’re told which one you’re on. This is a small, but very much appreciated design inclusion. You can also change the EQ of the sound, but you have to both download the Razer Audio app on your phone and connect it via Bluetooth. Once connected with the app open you can adjust the EQ settings under the Custom profile. I must admit, I found this to be extremely unuseful. I’m no audiophile, and there were some 10 sliders that you can alter. But I didn’t have any sound to test the changes. I played some music, but that doesn’t help me when I’m trying to finetune the sound for playing on the PS5. I do sometimes get calls during my gaming session and while the headset doesn’t allow you to talk on the phone AND hear your game at the same time, keeping your headset on does beat taking it off to answer your phone. All you need to do is hit the switch button and you can take the call while you continue playing. SOUND QUALITY I want to break up my comments between the sound and the microphone into two. I found the sound to be pretty good, but the microphone was a different issue. Just playing a single player game, I found the default sound settings to be adequate. There wasn’t a lot of bass, but I found the sound to be accurate. The FPS setting was nice because you could hear footsteps (it takes down the bass levels). I want to add that the 3D audio that the PS5 is known for, worked well. You could hear all around your character. I didn’t find too much to distinguish between the sound quality among the profiles other than the FPS setting which, as I said, drops the bass down. All in all, the sound quality was pretty good, I really didn’t have any complaints there. I didn’t think it was any better or any worse than my PS5 Astro model. MICROPHONE This is the part that I can’t really get past. When I switched from my Astro headset to the Razer Kaira Pro, I got tons of complaints from my friends when chatting on PS5. They said it sounded like I was in a box. I moved the microphone closer to my mouth but all that did was make me sound louder, inside that box. Granted, I can’t really hear myself, but when my friends are complaining about how I sound, I take notice. Sure, they could hear me, but the point is that for $200 I expect to sound great on the other end of the line so to speak. This was basically a deal breaker for me. HAPTIC FEEDBACK I want to specifically mention the haptic feedback because it’s the first time I wore a gaming headset that vibrated. It has 3 different levels of vibration. While at first it’s cool, and makes the bass seem deeper, it becomes an issue after a while. Forget about the highest vibration setting, as it’s too annoying and distracting. At the lowest setting, however, it was still distracting. Call of Duty, for example, was cool at first. Feeling the explosions was an additional level of immersion. It was neat. But after a bit it was a bit annoying. When my friends talked however, was when I turned it off. It vibrates whenever my friends talk, so when I’m playing Call of Duty with my friends, it seems like it was constantly vibrating. Almost made my friends talking sound like it was reverberating and not natural speech. It got to the point where you felt like you were hearing motors vs feeling the feedback. I ultimately turned it off. CONCLUSION At $200, I simply cannot recommend this headset. The audio quality is fine, but the microphone quality is its achilles heel. And if the vibrations didn’t become so annoying or noticeable, it might have overcome my complaints about the microphone but it doesn’t. Because I turned that off too. It’s really comfortable, but there are just as good sounding headphones at a cheaper price point.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: Great Aesthetics which match the PS5 Fairly lightweight/comfortable for longer durations Default sound signature is fairly neutral and enjoyable out of the box Vocals in particular sound excellent right out of the box Haptics are a surprisingly fun addition to audio, with three different intensity levels (+off) based on your preference All of the necessary functions (BT Connect, Volume, Mic, EQ, Haptics, etc.) are all adjustable using buttons on the earcups Sounds great with the PS5’s 3D Audio feature Razer SmartSwitch allows you to swap between 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth quickly Detachable microphone CONS: Earpad material gets a bit warm over longer sessions Mic quality sounds overly processed Headband could use a slightly wider cushion area Battery life is only okay AESTHETICS: The Razer Kaira Pro is a unique proposition of a headset in the crowded gaming headset space today. Its aesthetic cues follow that of the Playstation 5, with a white outer headband, black earcups/inner headband, and a subtle blue fabric inside the ear cups covering the drivers. Having been lucky enough to get a PS5 shortly after it released, and living with it for over a year-and-a-half now, it’s actually quite amazing how well this headset matches the PS5’s aesthetic form. In fact, when they are turned off, at a glance you would be hard pressed to tell that they are a Razer product at all, with only subtle etchings of Razer’s triple snake logo on each ear cup and the name “RAZER” etched into the top of the headband. There are no overly bright colors, edgy design cues, exaggerated lines, or other elements that can tend to come with a “gaming” product. The only real significant gaming aesthetic comes when the headphones are powered on, and the razer logo on each ear cup glows with the traditional Razer Chroma RGB. However, these RGB colors are fully tunable via Razer’s Chroma app, allowing you to select a variety of presets or single colors, all to match your preference. All-in-all, I certainly would feel more than comfortable taking these to work without feeling like I am wearing something overly flashy, and when playing my PS5 with my white DualSense controller, these fit right in perfectly. BUILD/COMFORT: When it comes to build quality, these are about 95% hard plastic, with the only metal pieces visible being the connectors from the headband to the earcups (arguably the most important piece since this tends to be where most headphones break), and the outer frame of the adjustable headband scale. With plastic though comes a much lighter weight headset, which while not insignificant, never felt too heavy, even after several hours of gaming. The earpads look to be made of a soft, leather-like material on the outside, with a slightly softer fabric on the inner ring of the earpad. The pads themselves feel like memory-foam, very soft and comfortable, but do tend to get noticeably warm the longer you wear them. In terms of the headband, the top ~⅓ is a soft padded material, while the sides are also a hard plastic. While mostly comfortable, I did find myself wishing the headband had a wider cushion area, as my larger head did tend to get a bit irritated after several hours. Nothing to write home about, as it is still a very comfortable headset, but could be a nice improvement on future headsets. Not the most uncomfortable headphones I have used, but also not the best either. FEATURES/PERFORMANCE: In terms of the feature-set, the Kaira Pro is mostly full-featured, with enough of the essentials to make the $199.99 price tag worth it. You get a wireless 2.4 GHz USB-C adapter for wireless connectivity to your console/PC (I used mine with the PS5), and also Bluetooth for connecting to your phone, PC, or other devices. You also get several EQ presets to choose from (Default, Amplified, Enhanced Bass, FPS, & Custom, which as the name suggests, you can fully customize). I tended to prefer to stick to the default preset, which had a fairly flat/neutral curve that I favored. This being said, I did find the FPS preset to be a useful mode for multiplayer shooters where hearing footsteps are important. The other modes were less to my taste, but at least the options are there for those who prefer them. When it comes to Razer HyperSense haptics, you get 4 total options to choose from: off, low, medium, & high. The haptics are a fun feature, and while they seem like a niche trick that you try once and quickly turn off, I actually found they did increase immersion in games where they are well utilized. By default, the haptics are set to “Medium” which is good for some games, but I found to be a bit overpowering for more bombastic games. Generally, I tended to prefer the haptics on low, where they are more subtle, but compliment the haptics coming from the PS5 DualSense quite well. High is way too strong for my taste, but can be a fun trick to demo what the headset is capable of. When watching movies/videos, I tended to turn haptics off, as they became more distracting than immersive. In terms of sound quality, the headset sounds very good, especially with games where it counts most. With 3D audio on the PS5, the headphones displayed good imaging and soundstage for a closed-back headset, with no trouble locating enemy placements in COD or effect localization in Ratchet & Clank. The bass is present, but not overpowering or boomy, and the highs are very clear. The mids, in particular vocals, are where the headset shines best, with dialogue coming through clear and pronounced, particularly in light of other effects or music. When it comes to the mic, the headset uses a Razer HyperClear Supercardioid Mic, which is one of the weaker points of the headset for me overall. It isn’t a deal breaker, as I mainly use the mic for playing online with friends, rather than streaming or broadcasting, but it is noticeable when you hear yourself speak. The mic has great background sound suppression and voice isolation, but as a result, sounds a bit overly processed, and almost clouded or veiled. One of my friends said it almost sounded like I was talking behind a curtain, again not a dealbreaker, but one noticeable flaw among the other great features. A few things to note on the Razer Audio app and control over the headset. Specifically, that 1: you can skip using the app and not worry about missing anything significant, and 2: the onboard headset controls are great. In terms of the app, you can control the EQ presets (along with building your custom EQ), view the battery life, and manage firmware updates. Beyond that, there really isn’t much to do, and assuming you don’t do a lot of EQ adjustments, you probably won’t find yourself using the app much, which is great, because the on-headset controls are great. On the left earcup you have a button to mute the headset, volume wheel, and power/control button. On the right earcup, you have a smart switch which allows you to quickly flip between the 2.4 GHz connection and bluetooth (as well as cycle through the EQ presets), a mic volume wheel, and a haptic button which allows you to switch the various haptic levels. You can also control calls, skipping songs, and all other headset features right on the headset itself. While it seems like a simple thing to have all of these controls on the headset, having used several headsets with mandatory apps or non-intuitive controls, this headset is amazing from a utility perspective. Finally, battery life is okay, but nothing to write home about. You will have no trouble getting through a full gaming session on a charge, but you will find you need to charge the headset after just a couple of sessions if you play with the haptics a lot. Thankfully, charging is easy with the included USB adapters, and shouldn’t be an issue for most. My only other wishlist item for this headset would be an included carrying case, since I would tend to bring these around with me if I could transport them easily enough. They tick all of the boxes for a good portable pair of headphones to use for music and travel.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love almost everything about this headset. It looks great, has a solid build quality and feels premium, nice features like Bluetooth phone pairing, works on PlayStation or PC, and sounds fantastic. I only have one big issue with it that I have had with many headsets over the years since I have a very large head, and that is the long-term comfort. Right from the start upon opening the box you can tell this is on a different level. Even the packaging is very premium and gives you the impression it is going to be awesome. Included are the headset itself, USB-C dongle that has an offset plug so it won’t block the other port on the PS5, a converter cable for hooking the dongle up to USB-A, a USB-C charging cable, the detachable mic, and instructions. As soon as you power it on you can feel the HyperSense vibrating to let you know its there. HyperSense adds additional pulsation to the sound primarily for Bass and can be adjusted in 3 levels or turned off. It is at level 2 by default, and I felt like that was a nice balance after trying all 3. Quick Connect for switching between the 2.4 dongle on Consoles and PC or Bluetooth for phone is a small button on the back of the right earcup, and while it does not allow you to use both simultaneously which is unfortunate, it is quick as advertised allowing you to switch over and answer an important call without having to take off your headset. The TriForce Titanium 50mm drivers produce balanced sound with nothing getting left behind. I can feel the Bass and hear the highs and mids without any distortion, and the 3D audio works wonderfully on PS5. I prefer to hear my games as the devs intended rather than adding any additional sound mixing and I feel like these are perfect for that preference. The mic sounds good with excellent noise cancellation, and a slight mic monitoring effect so you can avoid finding yourself yelling into it. It is removable for those times when a single player game is all you need. Battery life has been of no concern for me, all I ever want is for the battery to outlast me when I sit down and play, and this does. Seems like it would easily go around 10 hours from a full charge with HyperSense running. At my age that is more than enough for my needs, gaming marathons are very rare these days. Comfort is my biggest concern. I love the way the earcups feel, the leatherette outer shell is easy to keep clean and provides excellent sound isolation, and unclear in the pictures the inside against your head is actually a fine mesh-like material to enhance breathability. The weak point is the headband, as it has a short, skinny padded area that doesn’t quite cut it for my very large dome. So as a result, if I wear the headset for more than a few hours it can start to become uncomfortable at the band. Thankfully the earcups don’t press hard on my glasses so at least I can avoid any other forms of discomfort other than the headband. Aesthetically pleasing, it looks like it was designed specifically for the PS5. The Chroma RGB is a nice little addition for anyone like a streamer who wants their headphones to be showier although for me its something I forget is even there. As previously mentioned, it is very well built, feels solid, and seems like it will be very durable in the long run. I really like it and will keep using it since my gaming sessions are usually limited enough that I don’t run into comfort issues before I am done playing anyways.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve recently gotten addicted to collecting various headsets. I\'ve tried many, many different brands over the past few years. I do have a small hearing issue, so finding a great headset that allows high(er) volume levels, customization and great sound are crucial for me, as well as Bluetooth functionality. These Razer Kaira Pro PS5\'s fit the bill...mostly. Let\'s start off with the unboxing. Overall, the box/packaging is great and really feels premium on both the outside and inside, as is the usual for Razer products. Inside, you get the headset itself, the detachable mic, a USB-C receiver, a charging cable and a USB to USB-C cable so you can plug it into a regular USB port, if needed. Overall, I like the packaging and unboxing experience. The headset itself looks sharp. I love the white/black color scheme, which fits the PS5 really well. The earpads are pretty comfortable and have not yet gotten sweaty on me or anything. The clamp force, at least for me, was a bit between light and medium. Not too tight, but not too lose. If you shake your head violently, they WILL come off, lol - but that shouldn\'t happen often, haha. The look of the mic came across to me as pretty standard and quite frankly, cheap looking. It is detachable, thankfully, so if you don\'t plan on chatting while gaming or taking a Bluetooth call, you can just keep it detached. Setup was pretty quick and easy. I had no issues connecting it to my PS5. I did download the Razer Audio app and it\'s really bare-bones - I honestly don\'t see a need for this. There\'s only a few options within, along with the current firmware version. That\'s it. Oh and if you want to mess with the Chroma lights, there\'s another app for that. I find that needing two apps for this headset is a little unnecessary. Because of this, I decided I\'m just gonna leave the RGB at the defaults. During use, I didn\'t notice any audio drop-outs or anything of that nature and everything seemed pretty stable. I just never could figure out how to update the firmware...I know on my Kaira Pro\'s for the Xbox, there\'s a Kaira Pro program for the PC that does the updating. But there doesn\'t seem to be anything like that for these. Perhaps the Razer Audio app takes care of this and there just currently wasn\'t an update at the time I received them? I was unable to locate any information on this in my Google searches, either. As for Audio, these cans sound pretty great. I had no complaints in regards to the audio quality and they do get pretty loud. Not quite as loud as my primary gaming headset, but pretty close. Bass sounds great, as well. Now, about the Hypersense. As someone with a hearing disability and being used to rely on vibrations as a ""secondary"" sense, I was really hoping this technology would help make up for some of my issues. Such as, vibrating on footsteps within say, Call of Duty. Alas, it just doesn\'t seem to work that way. It\'s more of an extension to the overall audio itself and to me, felt more reliant on the bass for feedback more than anything. At first, it\'s really neat and you\'re just soaking it all in because it\'s new. But after about 2 hours of Vanguard, I felt myself wanting to lower the intensity of it or turning it off, altogether. However, Elden Ring was a much more pleasant experience, as the vibrations weren\'t so constant and jarring. Over time, though, it just feels like this feature can become ""gimmicky"". Not to mention the extra battery drain. With Hypersense on Medium and the default Chroma RGB, I got about 18-20 hours of juice, which is pretty subpar, as most headsets these days boast at least 40 hours of battery and some upwards to even 50. My biggest peeve with this headset and one of the main reasons I\'m not 5-starring it is because of the Razer ""Smartswitch"" feature. Really? This is a FEATURE? Wow...it\'s more or less like an advertisement for a downgrade. My primary gaming headset, along with others I own, fall into the $100 - $150 price range and allow me to game AND use Bluetooth at the same time. I\'m playing Elden Ring and I get a call? Great, I can answer it and talk to whomever and the game audio is lowered in the background, but I can still lightly hear it. Not with these Razer Kaira Pro\'s...if you are gaming and say, a call comes thru, you have to hit the ""Smartswitch"" button to change over to Bluetooth on your phone or whatever device is connected/paired. This, in 2022 AND at this price point, should not be the case. Oh and if I\'m gaming and my phone dings, I don\'t hear it over the headphones and the audio, so I miss out on things like that. Really, really unintuitive and requires more micromanagement than needed. Bluetooth should be simultaneous. And lastly, the mic. Wow...this has to be one of the worst headset mics that I have used. When testing it on a call or even PS5 Party Chat, I was told pretty consistently that I sounded really bad and hard to understand (as well as not very loud), which is a first for me. I switched to my other headset I use on the regular and was told it was MUCH better. I\'ll keep these Kaira Pro\'s for Solo play, when I want to enjoy the Hypersense...and just keep the mic detached. I\'ll use my other headphones for when I need quality voice chat and/or I just don\'t want the Hypersense functionality. So, in conclusion, I\'m rating these a 3 out of 5. I\'m docking majorly for the limited Bluetooth functionality and calling it a ""feature"", the bare-bones phone app, the fact that two apps are needed to fully customize/configure the headset, being unable to locate HOW to update the Firmware (which I\'m pretty sure is via the Razer Audio app) and the 20 hour battery life (yes, I get it will be higher with Bluetooth and Hypersense off). Oh, and the abysmal mic. If you don\'t care about the Bluetooth functionality, then, maybe consider these a 4 out of 5.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this headset, amazing sound quality. And they are very comfortable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a gamer, you understand that having total sound immersion is just as important as audio immersion. With the that being said, the Razer Kaira Pro HyperSense fully deliver on that! PROS: - Unboxing and setup was a breeze! They are pretty much good to go besides making sure they are charged and downloading the optional apps for them. - The headphones themselves look beautiful! I love the white and black design, they have a high quality feel to them, and just have a nice blend of simple and detailed. - One of my favorite aspects of these headphones is out versatile their connection can be. They connect via Bluetooth, USB-C, USB-A, or wired. And to me that is just great functionality! - Once turned on and connected, the sound definitely is impactful! The sound is crisp, bass is deep, and the headphones provide a great seal to make sure you are really immersed. - On top of that, they have an excellent microphone attachment which came in very clear and was easy to use. - Although these are advertised for the PlayStation 5, you can use them for just about anything! PC, Mobile phone, tablet, Nintendo Switch, or your streaming device to even watch movies! - The RGB lighting is really cool on it too! Really gives it that gamer look to it. - Finally, I love the hypersense haptics vibration feedback are game changers!! Really adds a whole new level to your gaming experience. CONS: - I think these are beautiful headphones, I just wish they were a little bit slimmer and had a more low profile look to them. BOTTOM LINE: - If you are looking for gaming headphones to add to your experience, these are the way to go! They offer a premium feel, really solid sound for the price, a great microphone, and excellent additional features like the RGB and Haptic Feedback. Razer has provided another excellent move into the headphone realm!']"

I think Sony has done a good job with these. I tested them on a range of music (1970s and 1980s mostly, but also jazz) and with radio and podcasts. Unboxing was easy. The safety and compliance documentation, as always, is printed in tiny type, so some people may need a magnifying glass. However, I'm genuinely unsure how many people read this. Setting up took literally seconds: just add them as a Bluetooth device and you're up and running (my experience was in adding them to a MacBook Air and to an iPhone). The user guide can be accessed by using QR code. There is an app to download, but as I already had another set of Sony headphones I already had a copy. I listen to more voice – radio and podcast – than music, and in that category these headphones operate well. I also want to highlight that I have a slight hearing problem (age-related), often having to ask for words or phrases to be repeated. I did not have any hearing problems when using these headphones: all words were intelligible on first listening. The number of button presses causes certain actions to take place, for example four presses of the right button increases volume. The buttons work flawlessly."", ""I got these earphones about two months ago. I love them. They are bassy, loud, light weight (sometimes I forget I'm wearing them) and the battery life is outstanding. I accidentally found out that tapping the right bud four times increases the volume and the left side decrease the volume. Ive also dropped them a couple of times from about waist height, for both the buds themselves and the case but they still m working perfectly without any compromise to the y and no scratches (the case is made of a matte like finish and I haven't found any issues with them. One downside is call quality, it isnt that great especially outdoors in noisy environments such as restaurants, the street and parks. There also isn't ANC but they do a very great job canceling out the noise using passive notice cancellation (I mean just plug them in your ears and they seal perfectly, blocking out outside noise). I also wish I could assign a pause and play function on my left bud in the Sony Sound Connect app, that way I'm not forced to wear my right bud all the time which over time will degrade my battery on the right side more than the left side (I like to balance the use of both sides). I also wish the 360 feature worked for Spotify. Other than that I havent seen any discolouration on the case and buds so far, they're great to listen to podcasts, movies and music on, and they have an outstanding battery life."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have the WFC510's in a baby blue which is a nice change to white or black as most earbuds. Time will tell how dirty they show. Not a fan of white headphones traditionally for that. The buds come in a very compact case that looks very sleek (picture with anywhere mouse for reference) comes with a charge cord and a few size tips to swap depending on your ear size Setup is incredibly easy, as soon as i pulled them out of of the case, a popup on my phone came on asking if i want to pair, selected yes and away we go. the Sound Connect app is pretty straight forward to use. you can view playtime, battery for each bud and case, adjust ambient settings the battery is great on this. Especially if you turn ambient sound off. To test the battery life i put on a 10+ hour YouTube video and let it go. After the first 8 hours, the buds were at 50%. i put them back in the case to get back to 100%. once they were recharged, (which didn't' take very long) the case was still at 70% remaining. after another 8 hours i was back down to about 50%. based on this and the fact that i could probably do this 2 more times with the case, i could likely get away charging this only once per week easily based on how much they'd get used at work or during activities. My only complaint is the lack of ANC. There is only Ambient sound and nothing. However, when set to nothing, i can't hear much. They fit so well into my ear and make a tight seal that i can't hear much, so its close enough. For the price, can't really complain about that. i rarely use ANC with my other headphones anyways unless i'm on a plane or train"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are in the market for budget friendly wireless earbuds that don’t compromise sound quality, then look no further. Don’t be fooled by the low price point because it doesn’t mean Sony has compromised on sound fidelity. These excellent wireless earbuds sound almost as good as more expensive earbuds. I have long used Sony products so setup was as easy as I expected. The Sony App is not required to use these earbuds, but it greatly enhances the user experience. The App offers numerous ways to customize the controls and sound. There is a 5 band equalizer and several different sound presets to customize the sound profile. Out of the box the earbuds are tuned to a pleasant but neutral sound profile. My personal preference is towards traditional click buttons, so I especially like that these earbuds use a mechanical button instead of touch controls. I found the battery power to be excellent. I was able to use the earbuds for a few hours each day without needing to recharge until after a couple of days. One earbud can be used at a time for the times that the use of both earbuds is not desired. Included in the box is a selection of small, medium, and large ear tips. Using the right size ear tip will not only create the best sound quality, but also create a nice level of passive noise cancellation. I plan to use these earbuds for outside activities where there is a risk of damage or loss. I have more expensive earbuds that I use for critical listening in my home. I find that any time I take my earbuds outside that there is a risk of them not making it back intact, so I like to have a set of less expensive earbuds that will not be as financially painful if they are lost or damaged. I am continuously amazed at how far Bluetooth earbuds have come in such a short time. What was reserved for more expensive earbuds, has now trickled down to the entry to middle range models. As long as you don’t need active noise canceling, then I think most people will be very pleased with how good these earbuds sound.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The new Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless Headphones now incorporate stunning audio advances with immense benefits for earbud listeners. It goes without saying that they are compact, lightweight, comfortable, unobtrusive, JPX-certified to be sweat and water-splash resistant and come with small, medium, and large, easily interchangeable silicone rubber earbud tips for an absolutely perfect fit. Available in an attractive selection of four colours (black, light blue, yellow and white), they now boast up to twenty-two hours battery life (eleven in the buds themselves and a further eleven hours’ charge in the pocket or hand-bag sized, cylindrical charging case) together with a five-minute quick-charging facility permitting an additional hour’s extended listening if required. Four further, wonderful enhancements include multipoint connectivity for simultaneous playback from two Bluetooth devices so that if you listen to music on one device and a call comes in on another, Sony’s technological magic pauses the music, allows you to respond, then resumes the music automatically. The second feature concerns the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine which ensures high-quality clarity and richness particularly for higher frequency sounds and musical registers. Additionally, when connected to the Sony Headphones Connect App, music and speech can be adjusted precisely to reflect personal, listening tastes and preferences. Thirdly, these earbuds, powered by a highly reliable Bluetooth chip and antenna, transmit sound simultaneously to both ears, rather than employing a more conventional left to right Bluetooth relay transmission. A control button on each headset (pressing, once, twice, three times, together with a hold function) instantly controls music volume, playback, phone calls and advanced voice assistant operations. A forth feature relating to the Ambient Sound external microphones on the earbuds enables listeners always to remain alert to their surroundings. I found pairing the earbuds to be quick, easy, and reliable with Windows ten and eleven desktops and laptops, Apple iMacs, Macbooks, and iPads, and Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and tablets. These earbuds guarantee an outstanding listening experience for all with a crisp clarity of sound and an authentic voice quality for telephone calls, speech, and drama podcasts, and rich and fully immersive stereophony for music, choral and concert hall performances. Optimum help and guidance are best sought from the Sony website and associated videos because the literature supplied is minimal both in content and font size which makes reading and understanding difficult. Nevertheless, while the sound quality will exceed most expectations, the advanced audio technology, versatility, and ease of use of these new earbuds will bring pleasure to all music lovers allowing even those with hearing impairments to enjoy anew cherished listening experiences.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used these ear buds for a week now they're are so much better than the wf c510 witch i have already the sound quality is absolutely amazing . they paired with my phone without a problem. They do not come with any charging cable but they do come with extra ear bud covers. They come really well packaged. Also they are very comfortable in the ear""]"

The number of button presses causes certain actions to take place, for example four presses of the right button increases volume. The buttons work flawlessly."", ""I got these earphones about two months ago. I love them. They are bassy, loud, light weight (sometimes I forget I'm wearing them) and the battery life is outstanding. I accidentally found out that tapping the right bud four times increases the volume and the left side decrease the volume. Ive also dropped them a couple of times from about waist height, for both the buds themselves and the case but they still m working perfectly without any compromise to the y and no scratches (the case is made of a matte like finish and I haven't found any issues with them. One downside is call quality, it isnt that great especially outdoors in noisy environments such as restaurants, the street and parks. There also isn't ANC but they do a very great job canceling out the noise using passive notice cancellation (I mean just plug them in your ears and they seal perfectly, blocking out outside noise). I also wish I could assign a pause and play function on my left bud in the Sony Sound Connect app, that way I'm not forced to wear my right bud all the time which over time will degrade my battery on the right side more than the left side (I like to balance the use of both sides). I also wish the 360 feature worked for Spotify. Other than that I havent seen any discolouration on the case and buds so far, they're great to listen to podcasts, movies and music on, and they have an outstanding battery life."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The new Sony WF-C510 Truly Wireless Headphones now incorporate stunning audio advances with immense benefits for earbud listeners. It goes without saying that they are compact, lightweight, comfortable, unobtrusive, JPX-certified to be sweat and water-splash resistant and come with small, medium, and large, easily interchangeable silicone rubber earbud tips for an absolutely perfect fit. Available in an attractive selection of four colours (black, light blue, yellow and white), they now boast up to twenty-two hours battery life (eleven in the buds themselves and a further eleven hours’ charge in the pocket or hand-bag sized, cylindrical charging case) together with a five-minute quick-charging facility permitting an additional hour’s extended listening if required. Four further, wonderful enhancements include multipoint connectivity for simultaneous playback from two Bluetooth devices so that if you listen to music on one device and a call comes in on another, Sony’s technological magic pauses the music, allows you to respond, then resumes the music automatically. The second feature concerns the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine which ensures high-quality clarity and richness particularly for higher frequency sounds and musical registers. Additionally, when connected to the Sony Headphones Connect App, music and speech can be adjusted precisely to reflect personal, listening tastes and preferences. Thirdly, these earbuds, powered by a highly reliable Bluetooth chip and antenna, transmit sound simultaneously to both ears, rather than employing a more conventional left to right Bluetooth relay transmission. A control button on each headset (pressing, once, twice, three times, together with a hold function) instantly controls music volume, playback, phone calls and advanced voice assistant operations. A forth feature relating to the Ambient Sound external microphones on the earbuds enables listeners always to remain alert to their surroundings. I found pairing the earbuds to be quick, easy, and reliable with Windows ten and eleven desktops and laptops, Apple iMacs, Macbooks, and iPads, and Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and tablets. These earbuds guarantee an outstanding listening experience for all with a crisp clarity of sound and an authentic voice quality for telephone calls, speech, and drama podcasts, and rich and fully immersive stereophony for music, choral and concert hall performances. Optimum help and guidance are best sought from the Sony website and associated videos because the literature supplied is minimal both in content and font size which makes reading and understanding difficult. Nevertheless, while the sound quality will exceed most expectations, the advanced audio technology, versatility, and ease of use of these new earbuds will bring pleasure to all music lovers allowing even those with hearing impairments to enjoy anew cherished listening experiences.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used these ear buds for a week now they're are so much better than the wf c510 witch i have already the sound quality is absolutely amazing . they paired with my phone without a problem.

Also they are very comfortable in the ear"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WF-C510 have been an inspiration of sound design and battery life. They are so easy to pair once you download the Sony app. I tried them on various devices including my mobile, tablet, laptop and tv. They have an exceptional long battery life, I managed to get 10+ hours and there was still plenty of power left. They are so comfortable to wear and they have good noise cancelling. I can highly recommend them to anyone who wants a quality product for a reasonable price. I use earbuds daily for 8 hours + and wouldn’t hesitate to use these daily. The only negative thing I can say is that they don’t come with a usb lead so you have to purchase one separately. But given the low cost of the earbuds it’s still a great choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very neat earbuds, complete with charger case. They setup with my android Google pixel phone was simple using the free Sony Headphones app. There's a tutorial on the app and an easy to use equaliser tool which adapts to your personal sounds. I tried Vocals and instruments with a clear range and details. I was very impressed with the 3D sound effects. Buttons on the buds gives you control without having to use your device. USB C cord supplied and the initial charge was about 3 hours, the battery life is good. It comes with a selection of ear cushions to enable a close ear fit, and comfort. The case is small easily fitting into a bag or pocket. The case is quality and has a spring closer. I really like these both for comfort and user ease.""]"

It had the feature where you push the mic up and it would mute. Thought that was cool until moving it up/down so many times made it loose and wouldn't hold in place anymore. This HyperX CloudX model has the mute feature as a switch on the cord which I thought was better. This way you don't have to move the mic up and down.

So the outside maybe made with metal and hard plastic materials but their interior parts are probably cheap or not secured enough to handle being tossed onto a bed for a two foot fall onto carpet. And in my opinion it wasn’t even worth it to have geek squad fix it so I tossed it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] You cannot go wrong with these, coming from the Hyper X Stingers, these are amazing. For comfort, they are light weight, no excessive pressure, padding is super soft. For microphone, super clear, the noice canceling feature of them are on another level, my wife can have her video on full volume next to me, and the microphone will not pick up anything but my voice. The microphone stick it self is very sturdy, stays in which ever place you want it. For the sound quality, they are very clear, foot steps and 3D audio work really good, they are not $100+ headsets so don’t expect too much bass or crazy punch. For the overall build quality, sturdy, flexible, good materials. These headsets should not be rated low just because of defects that can easily be taken of by the warranty.']"

Regarding the cosmetics and the look/feel of the headset, its feels a bit lighter compared to another headset that I own as its doesn't feel or look bulky all around. What I indeed do indeed like, is the volume knob which is easy to find by touch/feel, unlike a rocker or volume wheel which can be uneasy to find by touch or there may be another rocker wheel that is around the same area but either on the side or below/above; This volume knob is perfect. There is also a mute button for the microphone for easy mute and unmute, as opposed to where some headsets don't have a mute button but only to fold up the mic to turn it off and fold it down to turn the mic on. Also the mic is removable. Another feature I like is the EQ button on the right side (or Smartswitch to toggle between Bluetooth and the 2.4 Dongle Audio Source by holding the button down for a specific amount of time). Currently the presets are Game, Music, Movie and Custom - from what I understand you need this Synapse Software to create Custom Presets. Unfortunately for the time being, I have a Mac and that Synapse software is Windows 10/11 only (Soon I'll have an Asus Rog, handheld gaming PC with Win 11). I did game a couple of Sessions on PS5 playing COD MW II and its sounds good so far - Bass seems good enough if the volume is not too high, and on the Movie sound preset profile, and of course good surround sound to hear what's coming or what's around. But its only a matter of time to create a custom EQ profile soon once I get a Win 11 handheld gaming pc and embed it into the Headset - But Razer should look into consideration if at all possible to make Synapse for iOS, or have this specific Blackshark headset model included in the compatibly for using this other iOS app called Razer Audio (though the app ratings aren't doing too well). Next, I have tried this on my SteamDeck (its a Linux handheld gaming console that runs some PC games from Steam), through their official USB-C/thunderbolt dock that has a number of usb ports and I have also plugged in the 2.4ghz receiver into the available port. It does show up as the audio output source choice in settings; Went ahead and played Deadspace 2 - well it's scarier with the surrounding audio and especially on the Movie EQ setting. Later on played a bit of Halo Infinite and also awesome boom and gunning sounds as well. Overall, it is a great headset for both console and PC, especially customizable EQ settings and the volume knob along with the removable microphone are a couple of things I praised which my older headset didn't have."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro wireless gaming headset is a high-end offering from the popular gaming peripheral brand that is designed to deliver top-notch audio quality and comfort for gamers. It boasts of THX Spatial Audio technology that simulates a surround sound experience, making it an ideal choice for gamers who want to be fully immersed in their gaming sessions. The Razer V2 Pro has a sleek and stylish design that is reminiscent of a fighter pilot headset. The black matte finish gives it a striking appearance that is sure to turn heads. This headset is built with superior quality materials that are lightweight durable and very comfortable to wear for longer periods. The ear cups are lined with memory foam and covered with a breathable fabric that helps to reduce heat and sweat buildup. The headset is adjustable and nicely padded, ensuring a secure and most comfortable fit. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro's sound quality is exceptional, thanks to the THX Spatial Audio technology that simulates a 7.1 surround sound experience. The headset delivers crisp and clear audio with a deep bass that gives explosions and gunfire a satisfying punch. The directional sound is also excellent, making it easy to locate the source of sounds in-game. The Razer BlackShark microphone is detachable and flexible, allowing you to position it for optimal sound capture. The microphone's sound quality is impressive, with clear and crisp voice communication. The microphone also has background noise canceling features that filter out unnecessary noises ensuring clear communication even in noisy environments. This V2 Pro uses a USB dongle as well as Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to a PC, PS5, PS4, or Nintendo Switch, The headset has a long wireless range too providing ample distance for gamers to move around while gaming. The battery life of the headset is also great as described by manufacturer it lasts near to 70 hours on a single charge. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro can be customized using the Razer Synapse software. The software allows gamers to adjust the equalizer settings, customize and program buttons on the headset. The software is easy to use and intuitive, allowing gamers to tailor the headset to their preferences but one thing i want the Razer to work on is to develop an App for Android and IOS platforms. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is one of the most comfortable gaming headsets i have tried till date. The lightweight design, memory foam ear cups, and well-padded headband make it easy to wear for extended periods without causing discomfort. The breathable fabric on the ear cups also helps to reduce heat and sweat buildup, making it ideal for intense gaming sessions.

The headset connectivity options and impressive long lasting battery life make it a great option for anyone who value freedom of movement. On a whole Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is an excellent value for serious gamers who want to take their gaming experience to the next level."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ----- SUMMARY ----- Verdict: The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro checks all the boxes. The comfort, audio performance, mic quality, and battery life exceeded my expectations. These features make for a phenomenal headset worth considering. Pros: - Comfortable, even during prolonged use - Excellent audio performance - Impressive mic quality - EQ profiles pre-loaded - 70-hour battery life Cons: - None ----- DETAILS ----- Design & Comfort: With its lightweight design and comfy earcups, the BlackShark V2 Pro can be on my head for hours without discomfort. The clamping force feels just right, and I can wear glasses comfortably with the headset. Since I use the BlackShark V2 Pro for both work and gaming, comfort during hours of use is huge for me. You’ll find the USB Type C charging port, boom microphone jack, microphone mute switch, power button, and volume knob on the left earcup. The right earcup just has one button, but it has multiple functions. Pressing it once changes the selected EQ preset. In standard EQ mode, there are game, movie, music, and custom presets. Holding the EQ button down for three seconds switches the headset to eSports EQ mode where you can swap between presets designed for Fortnite, Valorant, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and CS:GO. The same button is also used to switch between the 2.4 GHz connection or Bluetooth. As for build quality, the BlackShark V2 Pro strikes a good balance between lightweight and durable. The headband is flexible, and the earcup sliders are thin but made of stainless steel. Though the earcups are just plastic, they feel solid. Audio Performance: The BlackShark V2 Pro has crystal-clear audio and rich bass. The default EQ profile is pretty balanced. To me, it seems to favor the mids and highs and leaves a little to be desired in terms of bass, but that can be easily adjusted in the Razer Synapse software (more on that later). Whether I’m exploring an open-world single-player game like Red Dead Redemption 2 or competing with other players in a game like Call of Duty, I’m often pleasantly surprised by the level of detail and immersive surround sound produced by the BlackShark V2 Pro. In a game like Call of Duty, hearing faint noises like footsteps can be a significant advantage. Using either the 2.4 GHz connection or Bluetooth, I haven’t experienced any loss of audio or other connectivity issues. Mic Quality: The first time I used the BlackShark V2 Pro headset during a remote work meeting, one of my teammates commented that my voice sounded like it changed to high definition. I had previously used another Razer headset, and my teammates were impressed by the drastic improvement. I recorded my voice to listen for myself, and I agreed with my teammates. The mic quality is exceptional. Features & Software: To custom-tune the sound equalizer, you’ll need to install the Razer Synapse software. If you don’t have it already, you should be prompted to install it once you insert the USB dongle and power on the headset. If you don’t get a prompt, it’s easy to download from Razer’s website. It only takes a few minutes to install. In Razer Synapse, you can set up custom profiles for specific apps and games. As I previously mentioned, there are also pre-built profiles for popular games like Fortnite, Valorant, Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and CS:GO. The pre-built profiles come loaded into the headset itself, so Razer Synapse isn’t required to use or swap between the profiles. You simply hold the EQ button on the headset down for three seconds to activate eSports EQ then tap once to switch between the game profiles. When trying out the Fortnite and Call of Duty game profiles for each of those games, I did notice that footsteps, weapon swapping, reloading, and other faint noises seemed to stand out more. I’m not a pro gamer, so I need all the help I can get. Beyond the EQ settings, there are quite a few other useful settings in Razer Synapse as well, such as mic volume normalization, sound normalization, and power saving (the ability to set the auto turn-off duration). Battery Life: With around 70 hours of battery life, I’ve barely had to think about charging the BlackShark V2 Pro. If you solely use the Bluetooth connection, Razer says you could get up to 90 hours. In addition to gaming, I use this headset for working remotely. During meeting-heavy weeks, I’d typically drain most (if not all) of the battery on my previous headset. I think the average battery life of it was around 24 hours. Now, with the BlackShark V2 Pro, I should be able to consistently get two or more weeks of use on one charge. What makes it even better is that charging is fast. In just 15 minutes, the BlackShark V2 Pro can get about 6 hours of battery life. ----- WHAT’S IN THE BOX ----- 1 x Razer BlackShark V2 PRO Wireless Headset 1 x Removeable Razer HyperClear Super Wideband Mic 1 x Wireless USB Dongle 1 x USB Type A Adapter Cable 1 x USB Type A to Type C Charging Cable 1 x Product Manual', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are an amazing headset for gaming!

The combination of form-fitting pads and breathable material provides the most comfortable headset to wear. The mic is a good size and adjustable. The sound quality is amazing and they also have great noise canceling ability. The range is on point as well! They are very well made and durable. Hands down the best headset we have ever had! Absolutely great product!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Audio is a fundamental part in video games, either to improve our record or if we want to play competitively, also communication with your team is extremely important to achieve a victory. It is clear that there are multiple options on the market, however, a headset that combines comfort, audio quality, a microphone with a clear and loud sound, the least amount of buttons, a battery that lasts a long periods of time and at a reasonable price, is a little difficult to find. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro (2023) gaming headset meets practically all of these features and then some. Included in the box are the headset, microphone, wireless USB dongle, USB Type-A adapter, USB Type-A to Type-C charger cable and some documentation. The connection is very simple and easy, I have connected the headset to my PC with the wireless USB dongle and via bluetooth to my smartphone, in both cases the sound quality is quite good. In terms of performance the headset meet my expectations, or practically the demands that PC gaming and gaming in general currently require. The audio quality is outstanding, although I must say that in THX Spatial Audio mode there is not a big change, but it does improve the experience a bit. In relation to comfort I have nothing more to say, I have had them on for several hours daily and I have gotten used to them very quickly, to the point that sometimes I forget that I have them on. I have used them to play video games primarily, to listen to music, watch movies, YT content, listen to podcasts while I'm playing, in fact for multiple purposes and the result is satisfactory. The battery lasts a long time and it really lasts, I have been using these headset for a few days in a row with only a full charge and I have not reached 50% yet, this is a very strong point and that personally is appreciated. And speaking of things that stand out, the microphone is what most receives my attention because normally the microphones of wireless headset and more if they are detachable, don't always deliver a clear and strong sound as one would like, but in this case Razer has made an extra effort and it is noticeable, at all times my teammates hear me correctly and clearly, I have been very satisfied in this area. Regarding the design I can say that they are not the most aesthetic headset I've had because I consider them a little big, but I like them and mainly because they are comfortable. They come in matte black color, with sufficiently large earcups that cover my ear completely, at the moment it seems that I am using noise canceling headset. On the right earcup there is a knob that serves to modulate the volume, two buttons that are power and to mute or activate the microphone, on the right earcup the button to manage the bluetooth connection and also fulfills other functions such as switching device as well as selecting the equalization depending on the game you are playing, the software (Razer Synapse) has 5 presets for games that are Apex Legends, Call of Duty, CS:GO, Fortnite, Valorant, you can also create different presets to taste. In summary and based on my experience using gaming headset of different ranges, I can say that these headset offer enough and a little more for its price, there are headset that are around twice the price with practically the same performance, this product meets, and dare I say, exceeds my expectations. I can certainly recommend them highly."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the Best quality, Comfortable, Clear sound headset I have used. They are very comfortable on ears and head, the memory foam padding is soft & good quality. Its light weight.

The volume knob on the side is also very convenient. Battery life is good. It has noise cancellation effect; while playing I don’t like to be disturbed and this headset fairly cancels surrounding/external noises. No doubt this is my favorite among others. Love playing games wearing this headset. I have done meetings with it as well. One drawback, the foam padding is not replaceable, so better take care and keep it clean.

Nice that you can use Bluetooth to connect to your phone (or portal PC) on the go. What I don’t like: Must use as wireless, even though it comes with a long cord that you’d think you could connect to your PC and use as a wired headset. Weird microphone, maybe just my preference, but I like one that can flip up and down to mute and unmute, this one is kind of there and you have a button to press to mute that I don't particularly like. THX needs to be bought as an extra cost. Overall: Generally, I’ve enjoyed the headset, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good sounding wireless headset especially if you have other Razor accessories. There are a couple of weird design choices, but those don’t take away from the good experience I’ve had."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro 2023 improves upon an already solid device. It has a great microphone, audio output that is optimized for multiplayer gaming, extra cushioning, and a USB-C connector to complete the package. The BlackShark V2 Pro has a rich mid-range, as well as a highend that sounds incredible. They utilize Razer TRIFORCE TITANIUM 50 MM drivers to provide superb sound for any game genre. The microphone is one significant upgrade Razer made to this year's design. One of the greatest headphone microphones (wired or wireless) I have ever used, it is clear and sharp. The sound quality has drawn several accolades from people that I game with, which is great. The headset does not include head adjustments, but instead uses a band that molds around your head. I for one really like not having to manually adjust the headset since the BlackShark does it all on its own. It is extremely comfortable, and I have not had an issue with headaches or heaviness that you feel with some headsets. Long gaming sessions are not a problem at all. The headset also boasts 70 hours of use before having to charge it. As with most Razer products, you can customize the BlackShark V2 Pro using the Raze Synapse but keep in mind it does have pro-tuned profiles on board that you can choose from, which is extremely handy if you play different types of game types. Overall, the headset sounds amazing, and the microphone is, in my opinion, one of the best (if not the best) microphones on any headset. Razer killed it with the 2023 BlackShark V2 Pro.""]"

Still in very good condition and everything works perfectly fine.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m always a Hyper X gaming headset type of gamer!

Got some of my friends buying the very next day!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I went through a few different headsets for my PS5. This one definitely has everything I need. From comfort to sound everything is just right. The 7.1 works on PS5 and it adds a nice boost to everything without going overboard. Good for all around gaming. From FPS, RPGs, and much more. Side tone and mic quality are a good improvement over the cloud 2 wired. My only minor complaint is that the ear cups could be a lot bigger. I got some off Amazon that are thicker and breathe much easier. Check out the Wicked Cushion brand. All in all a great choice for a good all around experience!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great wireless headset! Great sound quality but the mic could be better but not complaining as people can still hear me kind of clear. Good feeling over the ears! Battery also last so long.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros: no latency issue. Plug in and start using right off the box. You can install hyperx ngenuity app for further customization like mic monitoring or turning on 7.1 surround sound or checking the charge on the headset (can also be toggled from headset itself but you wouldn't know for sure if it's turned on/off). There's physical button to increase/decrease volume or mic on/off which is the best. Biggest con for me is that the extender to fit it to the head is not that extendable. I never had this issue before with a headphone, im extended to the max right now. Another con is that my ears got a bit warm after wearing it for sometime but it wasnt that bad, my previous wired Razer had more breathability to it. All in all I haven't seen any sound lag while playing games in my PC which matters the most for me so definitely a win for buying this wireless headphones. Another important point which is more of a pro than a con but kinda annoying oa that ot goes into Sleep Mode after kept idle for a few minutes (like 5 mins) and you have to turn it on again. I guess that ia good because ots saving battery rather than ataying on and wasting a lot of the battery"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I ordered this thing to replace my Corsair Void Wireless, which had the headband cracked due to dropping it after a VR gaming session. This listing said it had 7.1 surround sound. I got the headset, it did not have 7.1 surround sound, only DTS. DTS sounds like garbage; it sounded like garbage in my Void, and it sounded like garbage in this headset. I confirmed with HyperX support (screenshot included), this model of the headset is not supposed to have 7.1, only DTS. It's probably a good pair of headphones, fits super comfortably, but I specifically wanted a pair that had decent positional audio capabilities, which this did not have."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones sound great and feel comfortable and the wireless range is great, but then the plastic holding one of the head phones in broke causing the red metal that slides into the plastic to fall out. Very annoying. The plastic is pretty thin so it\'s not too surprising that it broke, but I expected more out of headphones that I spent 122.99 on just last October 2022, and I can\'t think of anything out of the ordinary that I did to cause the plastic to break, either. The website did advertise them as being ""tough enough to withstand the perils of daily gaming"" whatever that means. For now I guess its gorilla glue, electrical tape and hope for the best.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] LOVE these. I had the wired HyperX Cloud II for years and loved them. Buying the wireless one was an easy purchase. It keeps the same fantastic comfort and build of the wired. Love the battery life. The mic mute button is easy to locate with just feel and the mic-mute red ring around the mic is a fantastic addition. Would buy these over and over. The mic quality isn't the best from what I've heard, but not bad at all for just comms. USB-C charger a plus for sure. Works fantastic with dongle on PC."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They feel sturdy, the sound quality right out of the box is great, and the Ngenuity software suite is minimally obtrusive. I was shocked to see they have added an EQ functionality to the Ngenuity software which makes these headphones even better. Just open the software, click enable 7.1 surround sound, choose an EQ setting (or create your own) if that's your preference, and you're ready to go. These blow the Arctis 7+ that I returned out of the water, seriously, there is no comparison. My only complaint is the color scheme, the red is a little loud. Please release this same headset in a grey/black variation and you'll cover all your bases from a user-preference standpoint.""]"

I love the fabric earmuffs and they are very comfortable to wear. Everything was working well, it was compatible with PC and above my expectations for the price I got it at, but one issue that I found was that the mic didn’t work for the headset. After doing a bunch of research on the internet, I found that in order for the microphone to work; I would need to buy a 3.5 mm headphone splitter.

I would recommend as a good affordable option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received these products for free from @influenster and @skullcandy in exchange for my honest review- I love these earphones because they are small and compact meaning you can take them anywhere. They also have a battery life of 20 hours so I do not have to worry about them dying. They are comfortable and stay put in the ear. They have amazing sound making my music and films enjoyable to listen too, as the earphones block out background noise.

The earphones connected quickly and to be honest the charge last longer than my AirPods. I would say for the price you can’t be the quality.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product for free from Influenster and Skullcandy in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try these because I personally didn’t have any wireless headphones and have been wanting some for a while. Once I set them up the first time it was easy, but the directions included were kind of vague and small to read. There are still some settings I have trouble figuring out, but once I use them and know I’m sure it will be simple. I like that the headphones charge and the case charges too. It helps the headphones last for a while. I used them on a 5 ish hour flight and then put them back in the case and the next time I used them was on another 5 ish hour flight. I didn’t have to charge them or anything. The case has a little loop to attach to something, I’m assuming, but not sure if that actually helps with securing them. I wish there was an easy way to know how much charge is left in the headphones and how much charge is left in the case. That would make it much easier to know when to charge and how much is left. Overall, I am happy I got to try these and will keep using these as my Bluetooth wireless headphones. The cost for these is low, so if you don’t want to spend a bunch of money on headphones these seem like a good basic option. I don’t know if I would purchase them personally.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are just fine especially for the price. The sound quality is ok. I’m not much of an audiophile but they’re definitely not as good quality as the older AirPods. I also had a lot of technical issues with the case. One of the earbuds only charges intermittently and it has to be right in the right spot for it to charge. It shouldn’t be that difficult considering they fit right into the case to charge but one of them still wasn’t charged on first use because of the contact issue. The instructions are also confusing for pairing more than one device. If you need something cheap and wireless, these are fine, but I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone except for that', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Skullcandy Dime 3’s case is very lightweight. It can be easily clipped to almost anything due to the build in loop. Which makes them incredibly convenient to carry around and quickly access. The earbuds fits nicely in my ears and it was very easy to pair with my phone. I was really impressed with the audio quality. Plus the battery lasts a long time. Overall I would say these are great quality and definitely would recommend it, plus the price is fantastic.']"

The safety and compliance documentation, as always, is printed in tiny type, so some people may need a magnifying glass. However, I'm genuinely unsure how many people read this. Setting up took literally seconds: just add them as a Bluetooth device and you're up and running (my experience was in adding them to a MacBook Air and to an iPhone). The user guide can be accessed by using QR code. There is an app to download, but as I already had another set of Sony headphones I already had a copy. I listen to more voice – radio and podcast – than music, and in that category these headphones operate well. I also want to highlight that I have a slight hearing problem (age-related), often having to ask for words or phrases to be repeated. I did not have any hearing problems when using these headphones: all words were intelligible on first listening. The number of button presses causes certain actions to take place, for example four presses of the right button increases volume. The buttons work flawlessly."", ""I got these earphones about two months ago. I love them. They are bassy, loud, light weight (sometimes I forget I'm wearing them) and the battery life is outstanding. I accidentally found out that tapping the right bud four times increases the volume and the left side decrease the volume. Ive also dropped them a couple of times from about waist height, for both the buds themselves and the case but they still m working perfectly without any compromise to the y and no scratches (the case is made of a matte like finish and I haven't found any issues with them. One downside is call quality, it isnt that great especially outdoors in noisy environments such as restaurants, the street and parks. There also isn't ANC but they do a very great job canceling out the noise using passive notice cancellation (I mean just plug them in your ears and they seal perfectly, blocking out outside noise). I also wish I could assign a pause and play function on my left bud in the Sony Sound Connect app, that way I'm not forced to wear my right bud all the time which over time will degrade my battery on the right side more than the left side (I like to balance the use of both sides). I also wish the 360 feature worked for Spotify.

Four further, wonderful enhancements include multipoint connectivity for simultaneous playback from two Bluetooth devices so that if you listen to music on one device and a call comes in on another, Sony’s technological magic pauses the music, allows you to respond, then resumes the music automatically. The second feature concerns the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine which ensures high-quality clarity and richness particularly for higher frequency sounds and musical registers. Additionally, when connected to the Sony Headphones Connect App, music and speech can be adjusted precisely to reflect personal, listening tastes and preferences. Thirdly, these earbuds, powered by a highly reliable Bluetooth chip and antenna, transmit sound simultaneously to both ears, rather than employing a more conventional left to right Bluetooth relay transmission. A control button on each headset (pressing, once, twice, three times, together with a hold function) instantly controls music volume, playback, phone calls and advanced voice assistant operations. A forth feature relating to the Ambient Sound external microphones on the earbuds enables listeners always to remain alert to their surroundings. I found pairing the earbuds to be quick, easy, and reliable with Windows ten and eleven desktops and laptops, Apple iMacs, Macbooks, and iPads, and Samsung Galaxy mobile phones and tablets. These earbuds guarantee an outstanding listening experience for all with a crisp clarity of sound and an authentic voice quality for telephone calls, speech, and drama podcasts, and rich and fully immersive stereophony for music, choral and concert hall performances. Optimum help and guidance are best sought from the Sony website and associated videos because the literature supplied is minimal both in content and font size which makes reading and understanding difficult. Nevertheless, while the sound quality will exceed most expectations, the advanced audio technology, versatility, and ease of use of these new earbuds will bring pleasure to all music lovers allowing even those with hearing impairments to enjoy anew cherished listening experiences.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used these ear buds for a week now they're are so much better than the wf c510 witch i have already the sound quality is absolutely amazing . they paired with my phone without a problem. They do not come with any charging cable but they do come with extra ear bud covers. They come really well packaged. Also they are very comfortable in the ear"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The WF-C510 have been an inspiration of sound design and battery life. They are so easy to pair once you download the Sony app. I tried them on various devices including my mobile, tablet, laptop and tv. They have an exceptional long battery life, I managed to get 10+ hours and there was still plenty of power left. They are so comfortable to wear and they have good noise cancelling. I can highly recommend them to anyone who wants a quality product for a reasonable price. I use earbuds daily for 8 hours + and wouldn’t hesitate to use these daily. The only negative thing I can say is that they don’t come with a usb lead so you have to purchase one separately. But given the low cost of the earbuds it’s still a great choice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very neat earbuds, complete with charger case. They setup with my android Google pixel phone was simple using the free Sony Headphones app. There's a tutorial on the app and an easy to use equaliser tool which adapts to your personal sounds. I tried Vocals and instruments with a clear range and details. I was very impressed with the 3D sound effects. Buttons on the buds gives you control without having to use your device. USB C cord supplied and the initial charge was about 3 hours, the battery life is good. It comes with a selection of ear cushions to enable a close ear fit, and comfort. The case is small easily fitting into a bag or pocket. The case is quality and has a spring closer. I really like these both for comfort and user ease.""]"
Refurbished (Excellent) - JBL Live 660NC Wireless Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - White,$179.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/refurbished-excellent-jbl-live-660nc-wireless-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-white/16540317/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After using these headphones for now quite some time, they are fantastic. The best parts about them is how durable and strongly built they are, in addition to being also lightweight. They really seem to quite handle any sort of situation. They also fold up and the ear cups do twist, making them super portable. I have used the headphones on a flight and they were perfect for the airport, on and off the plane, and simple connectivity to my phone. The noise cancelling is one of the most impressive things about the JBL Tune 660\'s! They took out the outside sound with no problems. I couldn\'t even hear people talking, and I hardly heard the typical airplane engine sound. In my opinion, they match almost equal to over ear style headphones noise cancellation (I have JBL E65btnc for reference). That\'s super impressive for on ear style headphones! That really took me for surprise! As for button controls are basic for what they are. Volume up, down, play, pause all worked fine with my phone. (I just find it easier to use my phone to adjust play/pause volume up/down.) As for sound quality, they are great, but not amazing. The Bass is definitely there. Mid\'s, Hi\'s Low\'s are pretty clear. I do think a lot of sound does go missing since they\'re on ear and not over ear. So you\'re kind of missing that ""3D surround sound"" that you\'ll get from over ear. To sum it up, for middle class style headphones they\'re great! If you\'re a type of person who\'s very on the move, and while in a car, train, plane, etc. wants to jam up some nice sounding music, then these are the right headphones for you. If you\'re more of a Sound guy or studio who cares a lot about the sound quality, go with the over ear to get the full experience. Highly recommended for the average buyer!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this when it was in sale for $150 and i love the sound. Noise cancellation is solid but youll definitely need to be playing something (music, podcast) to block out exterior noise like loud coworkers. Battery life is pretty awesome too - dont forget to download the JBL app. This fits my giant head with room to spare. Biggest downsides for me are the buttons are hard to differentiate when you have the headphones on and the noise cancellation can be stronger, but not bad for $150.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great quality and have great sound. I love how well the noise canceling works. I took these with on our road trip and it helped me keep my anxiety under control for the whole six hour drive.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PERFECT!!! AMAZING CONSTRUCTION!!!! COMFORTABLE!!! PERFECT SOUND!!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the Live 660NC for a week now. Upon receiving them and opening them up I first charged them using the included usb-c cable. They charged very fast. After using them for almost a week and for a few hours a day, they are still almost fully charged. Rated for up to 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. Pairing was easy. Once I turned them on and paired to my iPhone I utilized the Jbl Headphone app to setup more features. The app asks what assistant you would like to utilize. Your options are Google or Alexa. I’m using Alexa at the moment. Using the assistant requires you to either touch the left ear cup or simply say the assistant’s name. I typically call upon Alexa using moderate volume to turn on and off lights in my house and switching my alarm on and off. Works quickly and flawlessly. Great feature to have built into a headphone. The app also allows you to adjust the NC feature. You can have it on or off. Adjust your ambient awareness by amplifying the sound around you. Talk through raises ambient awareness and reduces Audio listening volume in order to have a conversation with someone while utilizing the headphones. NC works great with no annoying hissing at zero volume. The fit is a little tight but that is to aid in the function of NC. If they are to loose then the feature would work poorly and make unwanted sounds through the speakers. Sound quality is on point. The app allows you to adjust equalizer curves but I enjoy them flat. All sounds from bass to treble are present with nothing under or overbearing. Just a clear full sound at any listening volume. These get decently loud without hardly any sound leakage. The headphone are built tough! Super soft ear cups and strong headband with plenty of adjustment. I am truly enjoying these. They are my new go to headphone due to the sound quality, features and how comfortable they are to wear. I use them for hours without fatigue. I have headphones that have similar features but these are superior in every way. I highly recommend the live 660NC!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First off I want to say these headphones are very comfy. They are adjustable and fit nicely over my ears. I do have smaller ears, so for me I think it’s a great fit. The headphones themselves are aesthetically pleasing. I like the simple and sleek design. The right side has your power button, volume adjustment, noise cancelling button adjustment and the jack for the cord if that’s your preference. I really like that JBL added that feature, so you can choose between that or using Bluetooth. The left side has the port for charging the headphones. Both sides swivel which is cool too. Now as far as sound goes I’ve tried all genres from rock to hip hop, dance and different types of electronic. The sound is great, but when you are listening to a song with deep bass I noticed you need to have the headphones on perfectly, otherwise you get some reverb. In my case, the left ear piece seemed to have the reverb. (Mind you, this only happened with the music turned all the way up.) After playing around with the headphones and listening to other songs I realized If they are off slightly from your head the reverb can happen. Once I realized this I didn’t have any issues. These headphones really do sound good. I honestly can turn up the volume on most songs. As far as the noise cancelling feature they really do block out sounds very well. I used these while walking around the house, brushing my teeth with my electric toothbrush and lots of other background noises. I couldn’t hear a thing. These headphones have three features for noise cancellation. You can choose how much you want to block out, which I think that’s an awesome feature. These headphones also come with Google assistant and Alexa built-in. Unfortunately, I don’t use either of those so I can’t review that aspect. I do have an iPhone, so Siri can be activated too. Overall these are really nice headphones. I would definitely recommend them if the features described are something you’re looking for. One thing that’s really cool is when you’re listening to music and take them off they pause the music. Then when you put them back on they resume. I love that! You can also adjust this feature. JBL never disappoints with sound quality. They really out did themselves with these. Style and comfort are a 10/10. Sound and performance I would also give a 10/10. I love these headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Trust my review I am very picky when it comes to headphones. I definitely recommend these JBL Tune 660NC. These on ear headphones will surprise you for the price. Here is my rating and a couple of feedback for each category for them so that you know how they will work for you like they worked for me and my rating for them. I do have a full review below that though. Overall for Google Phones they connect fast, work hand in hand with the features of Google such as Voice Assistant and for me the active noise cancelling feature works awesome for me to where I don't have to take them off if I want to talk to someone or when I don't want to hear anything else around me when playing music or taking a call. >Fit 4/5 Covers my ears almost completely and a little snug though but with anyone with bigger ears will get that on ear headphone feel and fit. Can use it for active use such as in the Gym for like walking, running and weightlifting but would not recommend for crossfit or high intensity workouts when I tried it they would slip off or would not stay on. No upside down either. >Connectivity/Use 5/5 Paired fast with Google Pair and worked seamlessly with music, phone calls and voice assistant app Google Assistant >Battery 5/5 Have not had to charge it yet and its been 5 days! Sound 4/5 Clear crisp JBL sound I love. Could be a little louder though. Used it with different genres so you can def hear the individual highs, mid and lows. Can use your equalizer in your app to adjust it Also people around you cannot hear you turn it up so great to use on airplane and library. >Noise Cancelling Feature 4/5 Only cancels completely when playing music which that what JBL means by Active Noise Cancelling. But love it cause I don't have to take them off when having a conversation with people. Cancels Noise when I need them too. Only 4 because if someone is looking for noise cancelling completely you wont get that with these. Full Review Below!! Fit: They fit really well and are really comfortable. They seem built pretty sturdy. They sit on my ear pretty well. For everyday use they are comfortable and even work well while wearing glasses and a football hat. For active use they work well with sweat and your normal cardio like running and weightlifting. I wouldn't recommend them for like crossfit though cause for too much movement they kind of slip off. Connectivity: So I used my Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus for this test. When opening them out of the box my google used Google Fast Pair and automatically detected them and connected them without me having to go to settings which was pretty cool so if you do not know how to connect headphones that will eliminate stress. Did not lose connection with them. From being upstairs with them and forgot to leave my phone downstairs I was able to take a phone call and listen to music without interruption. Taking phone calls was pretty easy. The buttons on the headphones even let you mute, accept and even hang up on your calls. You can even use Google Assistant with and any other voice apps such as siri with apple phones and bixby with Samsung. With music can pause a song, go to previous and next song and of course adjust volume. Battery: Opened it up since last saturday and since a full charge has been a week of being off and on them and have not had to charge them and battery is only at 50%. So I would say the battery is definitely impressive. They do pretty well conserving battery they turn off after a while of not being used which never had that before with previous bluetooth headphones. Sound: The sound of the headphones were pretty clear and crisp and was even able to use the equalizer of my amazon music player to adjust it to different pre sets which really allowed me to watch the headphones adjust to jazz to rock to pop and really experience the headphones true range which they did not disappoint. I can turn them all the way up and people around me don't hear them so its great if you want to jam and not worry about disturbing anybody so feel free to turn them up in a library or airplane! lol Noise Cancelling Feature: So I gave them a 4/5 cause the Noise cancelling does not completely cancel the noise, I can still talk to someone with them on except they sound muffled whenever I am not playing music. Now when I play music I definitely cannot hear anyone or anything. I think that's where the active part of noise cancelling comes in they activate whenever you are playing music or on a phone call which I think is a really helpful feature to use most noise cancelling headphones you have to take off if you want to have a conversation with someone especially when working out in the gym but with these you will not have that problem."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Durability 5/5 Battery last forever so do not have to worry about having to charge them everyday or every other day. They are built really well. Ear muffs are real leather and the build and quality of them do not feel plastic like at all. Definitely headphones you can take with you anywhere. Carrying Case Helps Alot. Sound Quality 4/5 What you expect of JBL Sound Clear Crisp Defined Sound that makes you feel like you are in the Studio. While I wish they were louder cannot complain about what I am getting for the price. Technologically Advanced 5/5 Will Pause Music When You Take Them Off and On! Adaptive Noise Cancelling, Google Assistant to where I can play music and make phone calls without grabbing my phone or having to go into my music app saves me time and makes it very convenient. Value 5/5 Everything you get for this price and the features in these headphones will keep you out of the headphone market for a good while and provide you longevity for the future and updates with the JBL app that will give it access to new features or upgrades it gets in the future. Comfort 4/5 Are Adjustable and fit any kind of ear, Really Comfortable and don't fallout. Just be aware can get hot and sweaty after a while of wearing them if you are using it for active use so make sure you wipe it down so that you don't get anything in them. More Detailed Review Below: Durability: 5/5 These Headphones are very sturdy and will hold up well for your active listeners. Helps Also they come with Carrying Case for the Gym! The ear muffs are leather and they are not plastic like and seem like they really put good work and quality in them I am impressed. The battery has lasted me for almost 5 days after full charge from using them at the gym and I work out for about 1 to 2 hours. So the standby time and active time cannot be beat after 10 hours of active time and over 5 days of standby time. Sound Quality 4/5 Sound is crisp can hear every instrument as well as your lows, mids and highs. Almost makes you feel like you are listening to your music in the studio or in person. Love the three features on the headphones where you can activate adaptive noie cancelling , have it off or even activate the headphones to have a clear conversation with anyone. One thing I will mention is be careful what app you use to listen to your music My Amazon Music with HD played louder and clearer than my Spotify. For a moment I was wondering why the music wasn't as loud and I discovered it was from that. Still wish the headphones could go a little louder in my opinion. Technologically Advanced 5/5: These headphones work for you and connect you in more ways than one. When first turning on I learned I can connect them thru the JBL App which allows me to set them up and keep them updated so its nice to know a company that provides update for their headphones meaning that even after a year they can have some of the same features and access as new ones release which helps with longevity of the headphones. I love the feature where whenever you take your headphones off it pauses the music and when you put them back on it plays again! Google Assistant is awesome on these headphones you can actually get access two ways. One by tapping your left headphone or activating voice recognition which just by saying Hey Google and say your command she does whatever you ask like send text message play music which means I don't even have to open my music app to listen to music or make a phone call. It does it for me from these Headphones that is awesome. You can of course with the buttons on the headphone itself pause music, skip/previous song, accept/hang up calls, pause calls and your normal volume up and down buttons which complete the easy accessibility and convenience these headphones provide. Value: Cannot beat the price for everything you get with these headphones and like I mentioned before the durability and build of the headphones itself to where they fit comfortably, the clear and crisp sound of the headphones and last but not least the JBL App and Features these provide will make you not have to replace your headphones for a while. Comfort: They fit well and are adjustable and the ear muffs can cover a wide variety of ears from small to big to which my ears were small and my big brothers were big and it fit both of us well. They also stay put well too to where if you do decide to do exercise they are not cumbersome and uncomfortable. Only thing I would say is they can get a little hot and can get sweaty when working out which is normal not alot of breathability when wearing them only thing that could bother someone. Honestly my days at the gym just got better and I might go more often since now I can listen to the JBL 660NC there and enjoy them and not worry about having to hear anyone or anything just the music unless I am taking a call of course."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Enough bass, nice clear trebs and mids. Button controls are simple and easy to find. Pairs very well and battery life is not an issue. Noise cancellation works great and has a good transparency mode. The mic is ok for short calls. Fit is perfect for the gym and on the go. Very comfortable, especially for smaller people. You can’t go wrong at this 179.00 sale price.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We love the the Live 660nc. My wife tried them on and she just loved the noise cancelling. I thought the lightness was just right for me I don't like headsets that are to over exaggerated. These are the right size with an awesome sound. We really enjoy the Live 660nc . Awesome headset.""]"

More Detailed Review Below: Durability: 5/5 These Headphones are very sturdy and will hold up well for your active listeners. Helps Also they come with Carrying Case for the Gym! The ear muffs are leather and they are not plastic like and seem like they really put good work and quality in them I am impressed. The battery has lasted me for almost 5 days after full charge from using them at the gym and I work out for about 1 to 2 hours. So the standby time and active time cannot be beat after 10 hours of active time and over 5 days of standby time. Sound Quality 4/5 Sound is crisp can hear every instrument as well as your lows, mids and highs. Almost makes you feel like you are listening to your music in the studio or in person. Love the three features on the headphones where you can activate adaptive noie cancelling , have it off or even activate the headphones to have a clear conversation with anyone. One thing I will mention is be careful what app you use to listen to your music My Amazon Music with HD played louder and clearer than my Spotify. For a moment I was wondering why the music wasn't as loud and I discovered it was from that. Still wish the headphones could go a little louder in my opinion. Technologically Advanced 5/5: These headphones work for you and connect you in more ways than one. When first turning on I learned I can connect them thru the JBL App which allows me to set them up and keep them updated so its nice to know a company that provides update for their headphones meaning that even after a year they can have some of the same features and access as new ones release which helps with longevity of the headphones. I love the feature where whenever you take your headphones off it pauses the music and when you put them back on it plays again! Google Assistant is awesome on these headphones you can actually get access two ways. One by tapping your left headphone or activating voice recognition which just by saying Hey Google and say your command she does whatever you ask like send text message play music which means I don't even have to open my music app to listen to music or make a phone call. It does it for me from these Headphones that is awesome. You can of course with the buttons on the headphone itself pause music, skip/previous song, accept/hang up calls, pause calls and your normal volume up and down buttons which complete the easy accessibility and convenience these headphones provide. Value: Cannot beat the price for everything you get with these headphones and like I mentioned before the durability and build of the headphones itself to where they fit comfortably, the clear and crisp sound of the headphones and last but not least the JBL App and Features these provide will make you not have to replace your headphones for a while. Comfort: They fit well and are adjustable and the ear muffs can cover a wide variety of ears from small to big to which my ears were small and my big brothers were big and it fit both of us well. They also stay put well too to where if you do decide to do exercise they are not cumbersome and uncomfortable. Only thing I would say is they can get a little hot and can get sweaty when working out which is normal not alot of breathability when wearing them only thing that could bother someone. Honestly my days at the gym just got better and I might go more often since now I can listen to the JBL 660NC there and enjoy them and not worry about having to hear anyone or anything just the music unless I am taking a call of course."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Enough bass, nice clear trebs and mids. Button controls are simple and easy to find. Pairs very well and battery life is not an issue. Noise cancellation works great and has a good transparency mode. The mic is ok for short calls. Fit is perfect for the gym and on the go. Very comfortable, especially for smaller people. You can’t go wrong at this 179.00 sale price.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We love the the Live 660nc. My wife tried them on and she just loved the noise cancelling. I thought the lightness was just right for me I don't like headsets that are to over exaggerated. These are the right size with an awesome sound. We really enjoy the Live 660nc . Awesome headset.""]"
Turtle Beach Stealth 600X Gen 3 Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox Series X|S/Xbox One - White,$109.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-600x-gen-3-wireless-gaming-headset-for-xbox-series-xs-xbox-one-white/17919854/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones were amazing to say at the least. They fit so comfortably on my head and the sound quality was nothing short of perfect. I had no issues with connectivity or the battery life. The battery life lasts long which is a huge plus!!! Super easy to connect and I look forward to continue using these!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First off these things are absolutely made for more than just gaming! These are crystal clear right out of the box. They had a nice Sturdy frame and a nice balance to them, and the flippable microphone is very ""stealthy."" Overall these are absolutely one of my favorites for gaming now, the portability and battery life is incredible. 80 hours of battery life. They have a jersey like material for the ear cups. And these have some serious cushioning, like a lot! Lol but it\'s a good thing. These have built in A .I. Mic noise reduction and phone calls actually sound great in these! 2.5 Ghz wireless Bluetooth and the super low latency dongle which always came in handy for shooters and group chats. They had the ability to lay completely flat on display and on my neck. These are completely compatible with PC / PlayStation / Xbox / Switch and Mobile. Also you can configure the Equalizer to spec in the Swarm II desktop and mobile app. Overall I would totally give these five out of five for overall quality and reliability. These can easily be everyday headphones if u want them to be! Such an upgrade to being an all around essential pair of do-it-all headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been testing this headset for a week now whilst playing through Monster Hunter World for the first time (VERY fun game btw!) and it left me with a very positive impression. Firstly, I expected good things as I have owned previous Turtle Beach headsets in the past and they have held up very well with daily use, the Stealth 600 headset is no different. The headset itself has a nice and sleek look without any garish RGB elements, this feels like a headset for an adult with a really clean and sleek desk space that might lean more towards a wooden or black desk setup without a lot of the typical ""gamer"" lighting and a more refined style such as a home office/gaming area. The microphone can be pushed up and out of the way completely if you don\'t intend to use comms much and just want the game audio or even for listening to music. I downloaded the accompanying app because a big thing for me is having good mic monitoring so I don\'t stumble over my words and I\'m happy to say that with the app I turned mic monitoring up to max and it was decent enough that I could wear my headset and speak without getting confused. The app also allows you to tweak various other settings too which I did to enhance my audio experience. The audio quality is great, definitely no complaints on my end, and as previously mentioned things can be tweaked to your exact liking in the app. Having a wireless headset also takes away the frustration of getting tangled in cables or if I have to get up to do something I can just keep it on. I partied up with my husband and he felt that the microphone was good too and I came across clearly, not as clear as a dynamic or condenser microphone, the one I use is a Hyper X quad cast but for a built in headset mic it held its own and was definitely good enough! One last thing I\'ll add is that the headset was so comfortable! And as a girl I sometimes struggle to find headsets that fit but this is so adjustable I was able to headbang (for testing purposes haha) and the headset remained secure on my head, it didn\'t slip at all. Overall a 4.5/5 for me, not my favorite design but for the right person it looks sleek and refined and most importantly the audio quality is fantastic. I will absolutely continue to use this for Xbox gaming and it was a real treat to receive this product and get to enjoy it, thanks!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The way these adjust easily while doing so is magnificent! I love how it’s noise cancellation. The battery life does own up to what the brand says it lasts! These were so easy to set up, and to start using them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just perfect for XBOX fans! I note that their sound is just a bomb! They will last forever! very comfortable! Easy to connect in 1 minute! The battery lasts more than 24 hours!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headset is very comfortable I like the padding on the head and the wars. It connected to the Xbox with ease. It's very sturdy and has a long battery life. I love the sound especially playing CoD you can hear footsteps and things you wouldn't normally hear."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset has clear quality audio. It sounds like I’m inside the tv. They fit comfortably and have tons of padding around the ears for long lasting comfort. They are noise cancelling so I can’t hear anything outside of the headset while in game.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had a few headset from the standard one ear and mic to a wired turtle beach 10 years ago. Being a console gamer I’ll take any advantage I can. And the biggest upgrade from my 500 series is the AI noise cancellation. I play with the same guys all the time and they have often complained about background noise ( young kids). With this headset that is a thing of the past. They fit great and sound even better.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had never tried Turtle Beach products before, but I had always heard good things, so I was excited to try out their headphones! Things I loved - Not too heavy -Super comfortable to wear with glasses - Great audio settings, you can adjust your chat mix and master volume! Both wheels are textured differently so you more easily tell them apart quickly. - Long battery life - Collaspable mic - Can connect to my phone and laptop so I don't have to use it strictly for gaming. - A good amount of features for the price! Opportunities for improvement - The setup was a bit finicky but I eventually got it sorted. - The audio quality is good but not amazing, it gets the job done pretty well though!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like the sleek look of these and a plus that they are so comfortable. Very durable and doesn’t put too much pressure to cause headaches. The sound quality is crisp and clean, and it actually stays connected without disconnecting. The best part is I can play for hours without having to worry that they’ll need charging.']"
Steelseries Arctis Nova 4 Over-Ear Wireless Gaming Headset - Black,$99.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/steelseries-arctis-nova-4-over-ear-wireless-gaming-headset-black/18714613/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Steelseries Nova 4 are extremely good for the price. The battery lasts forever and charges quickly, its very comfy and will fit most peoples heads although the ears may get a little hot. It sounds pretty good with a profile put on it although getting Steelseries Sonar to work does take a little work sometimes. In the box you get the headphones, USB-A to USB-C charger, 2.4Ghz dongle, and a dongle extender. The microphone sounds decent but it does pick up some outside noise which the “Ai” microphone background noise cancellation doesn’t work amazingly. But I would recommend these headphones to everyone.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Nova Arctis 4 headphones have an amazing sound quality! I love that the cushioning around the ears is a nice thick padding for long wearing comfort. They were easy to connect to Bluetooth and the battery life last fairly long. I was using them for listening to music and telling my daughter how great they were so she quickly took them to try for her gaming system and she also said that the sound quality was really great on them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are soft and comfortable to wear while gaming. The surround sound and hear everything in all directions and where it's coming from. They are lightweight and easy to connect. The battery life is outstanding. I can use these on my PlayStation and PC. The microphone also works well.These are versatile and can be used with PC, PlayStation, Switch and Mobile."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 features a suspended headband design & a comfortable fabric in the ear cups which makes it comfortable for several hours of use. It is flexible & not overly stiff which makes it easy to take on & off. SteelSeries offers the SteelSeries GG app for using the headset with Windows or macOS. This provides the user some additional features that are useful like EQ customization & various settings for the headset. You can set up SteelSeries Sonar, which adds spatial audio features & expands the options for the EQ, but you have to sign up for a SteelSeries account to access these features. The SteelSeries GG app is similar to most gaming headset apps, but none of these are necessary to enjoy the headset though. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 advertises 36 hours playtime but I found it lasted for 39 hours. The headset charges using USB-C & charges really fast…six hours of playback after 15 minutes of charging!! Some of the other features are: * Great wireless performance * Super comfortable * Really long battery life * No Bluetooth Are there better gaming headsets out there….sure! But at a much higher price point!! This headset can keep up with any game & supply several days play time on one charge.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SteelSeries Arctic headphones are not only comfortable to wear for longer gaming sessions but also have great sound quality and they are easy to speak into as well. The cordless headphones hold a decent charge and are great for all ages. We did have some issues getting them to connect to the wireless controllers on an Xbox but they were easy to use on computers and other devices. My son loves them and would definitely recommend them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I don't usually use headphones for gaming just listening to music on my phone. However, these don't work well with my phone. I had to take off the case to plug-in the Bluetooth adapter otherwise it wouldn't go in all the way. Then while it was connected it would beep repeatedly while paused. That was annoying. So I tried it while gaming instead. You plug the Bluetooth adapter into a cord that plugs into the USB port on the system. The quality of sound was good and you can't really hear anything else in the background while wearing them. This is not something I can do because I game with my deaf brother who connects his cochlear implants to a mini-mic that he plugs into an aux port on the game controller. Because he does this, it is harder for him to hear me and wearing the headphones makes it harder for me to hear him. However, it's not impossible if the volume is very low or I remove one of the sides off of my ear. But if I were to game by myself then none of this would matter."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's comfy to wear for a long period of time with a stretch headband. The sound is okay. Connectivity is great but you will need to plug in the dongle. It also comes with a hidden microphone. I like the design overall."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset is awesome. Light and good quality. Easy to use and connect to other devices. Along with the wireless capability completely conquered me. It gives me a pleasant, comfortable feeling when wearing.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Steel series Arctis Nova 4 headphones are absolutely wonderful!

Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Wireless Gaming Headset for PC/Mac - Black,$229.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-700-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-mac-black/18338474/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Turtle Beach 700 G3 headphones come in black and white and have a PS5 and Xbox version (I tested the Playstation version on my gaming PC. They are wireless in 2 ways, they support a 2.4Ghz connection and Bluetooth.  I was easily able to connect to them directly from my PC and laptop via their BT.  I could also use the included USB dongles (two) which support either BT or 2.4Ghz RF. When using the dongle set to RF you can also connect to the headphones via BT, so I was able to stream music from my phone and PC (using \'crossplay\') to the headphones and still have them connected via 2.4Ghz.  On the bottom of the headphone you can control the primary selection (RF or BT); you must connect to each independentlythe first time, after that they connect automatically. The boom microphone is turned on/off when it\'s pulled down.  I used it with a phone call and intergame chat, and the sound quality was exceptional (I\'m told).  Their Stealth II App allows you to determine how you\'re connected and to update the headphones firmware (and dongles), if required (it was required when I unboxed).  I have several other wireless headphones, but these Turtle Beach headphones claim to have 80 hrs of battery life, nothing else that I have has more than 30 hours.  I had no problems getting them paired with either BT or RF.   The headphones are very comfortable, but a little on the heavy side, but how do they sound? I listened to several tracks from Boston\'s first album, and I was presently surprised by the quality and openness of the sound.  I have other wireless headphones that cost much more (but do have with much better noise cancellation) but doing an A-B listen to the Turtle Beach 700\'s were quite similar. The TB700\'s bass is actually a little deeper, but the highest highs not as tight, but the higher low end thru mid-range was just as good.  I went back and forth between ""More than a feeling"", ""Foreplay"" and ""Smokin"".  The bass deep and tight, overall exceptional.  The TB700\'s were every bit as good.  I then listened to Pink Floyd\'s DSOTM, and was quite impressed by the louder passages in ""Time"" and ""Money"". The quiet passages in ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" were better than I expected.  Some subtleties in the girls\' voices were more subtle, but they were 95% as good as something costing much more.  I wore the headphones for nearly two hours and except for being a tad heavy, the fit on my head and the cushioning was very comfortable.  Then tried playing same music from my phone (BT) and from my PC (RF) using the ""crossplay"" functionality, I could tell there was a difference in the sound, but it was very difficult to say which was better, I think the RF\'s very highs and deepest bass wasslightly better.  Listening to the deep bass heartbeats at the end of Eclipse, I could feel theimprovements from the RF transmissions. But it was hard tell the difference, and the crossplay does not cut over instantaneously, so a precise A-B is not possible. I proceeded to do some racing on Forza Motorsport, and I was so impressed I started smiling (something I try to avoid) I was very happy with the effects I heard. I then tried listening for footsteps in BF 2042, were they mine or theirs?  Which way were they coming from?  Everything I needed to hear/discern, I could picture in my head in different directions.  And the flying bullets sounded very realistic (I think) as they \'passed\' by... impressive.  And I\'m still smiling. With the chat mode (which TB claims uses AI to reduce background noise) the sound is very clear to listeners on the other end; here I really like flip-to-mute microphone, a very natural way to mute, and to then restart (much better than a key sequence).  There are volume dials for both audio and mic on the sides of the left headphones, right next to the power switch and ‘mode’ button which features some audio presets.  The headphones are charged via an included short usb-a to usb-c cable.  Turtle Beach claims the low-latency 2.4Ghz has zero delay between the sound you’re hearing and what\'s on the screen.  To be honest I could not tell the difference between Bluetooth and the 2.4Ghz RF link.  One other feature in the Stealth II app is found under custom settings for both headphones, and microphone.  This is the custom EQ setting for each.  A 10 band graphic equalizer allows up to 5 named custom settings.  This works very well and really elevates the perceived quality of the in/out sound. These are very nice gaming headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SOUND 10/10: I was interested in this guy for a lot of reasons. Most notably the new 60 mm Eclipse Dual Drivers with separate woofer and tweeter. And boy, they do not disappoint. The clarity here is EXCELLENT. The directionality (where someone is located in 3D space) is probably the most accurate I’ve tried. Explosions sound terrific. Crisp highs and mids for vocals are great. One of the few headsets that has true multi-purpose where I’m happy to listen to music, watch TV/movies, play single player games, or competitive multiplayer games and it does a fantastic job on all of them. Usually, a gaming headset will only do good in one or two of those situations. Sound quality here is a 10/10. Does support 24-bit 96,000 Hz wireless gaming audio mode on PC only. COMFORT 10/10: As for comfort. The earcups are huge. All ears will fit. Clamping force is light. Maybe a bit too light. Where if you lay down, they fall off your head. But I think that is one of the things that makes these so comfortable. Sometimes getting a full seal is hard due to that as well. Which requires minor adjustment. ProSpecs glasses relief tech works wonderful. I’m able to wear these all day long without getting temple pain with my glasses. The hybrid leatherette and athletic weave fabric keeps my ears cool, provides really good noise isolation, and is exceedingly soft and plushy. Good movement for the joints as well. Overall, probably one of the most comfortable headsets I’ve ever tried. Zero complaints here. CONTROLS 10/10: I’ve never seen better controls on a headset. On the left side from top to bottom you have your mode button which switches between four presets (which you can change in software and can be custom with a 10 band EQ), game volume wheel, voice volume wheel (when setup correctly), USB-C for charging, and a power on/off button with LED that notifies you of things. On the right earcup you have your CrossPlay Wireless button which will switch to your second dongle. Then a Bluetooth volume wheel, and last your Bluetooth multipurpose button (single press play/pause, double skip forward, Triple skip back). Along with an LED to notify you if connected or not. On the front left you have your retractable microphone. Which actually folds a bit towards your mouth for better positioning. It folds fully up into the headset where it lays quite flush making it pretty invisible. Additionally, the dongle will flash red notifying you are muted. As it is flip to mute. Also, like that you can put these around your neck comfortably as they lay flat. CrossPlay feature is really neat. You just press the button and instantly you are connected to the other dongle. CUSTOMIZATION 9/10: Inside the Swarm II App you can adjust nearly everything you could think of. Including noise gate, mic sensitivity, mic monitoring, mic presets, sound presets, remap wheel and mode button, 10-band EQ, how bright the dongle USB is, how loud the beeps on the headset are. My only complaint is that when I was first updating the headset it took forever, and I had to restart multiple times to get it to complete. I did this through my phone as that was what was recommended. They do have a PC app now too. It’s lightweight so not resource intensive. But if you have multiple Turtle Beach products they seem to have an individual product for each device which is frustrating. BUILD QUALITY 8/10: Main hinge is metal, but I think I saw one reviewer say the internals were plastic. The rest of the headset is mostly plastic. While it feels like high quality plastic, and I get no creaking it worries me a bit on durability. Moreso for those who are aggressive with their products. All buttons feel good to press. Wheels scroll nicely. None of them are loose in the socket. It’s a very large headset. BATTERY LIFE 10/10: 80 hours. 15-minute quick charge gets you 3 hours of play time. Can play while charging the headset. No complaints here. MICROPHONE 9/10: Uni-direction, flip-to-mute, has high-bandwidth on PC, which performs great for a wireless PC microphone. Turtle Beach continues to be one of the best when it comes to mic monitoring. My voice had good clarity while still having the lower end timbre of my voice making me sound mostly natural. Good enough that I’d use it for a YouTube video. Additionally, would use it for making calls. Has a slight amount of “headset” sound where you can tell I’m on a headset. But not nearly as bad as most. Also, got plenty loud. Flip to mute does not make a noise and is silent. Didn’t get peaking. Again, they did a fantastic job here. CONS: - Both of my wireless dongles are not great. One of them refuses to turn on about 50% of the time. The other one is spotty and loses connection semi-regularly. Despite being in a clear line of site with nothing else around it. So, I think both of them are semi-faulty. - Bluetooth 5.2 connects extremely fast. However, trying to pair to a new device is frustrating. As holding down the button doesn’t put it back into pairing mode. Seems like you have to disconnect from another device first. Do think some user error is happening. But due to them changing the usual song and dance compared to everyone else. But everything else is great. Had no issues with dropouts or it disconnecting. - Technically, my Stealth Pro and A50X sound a bit better. This has better directional quality and perhaps bass. But the other two have a full sound. For example, this is say 9/10 and those are 10/10. Minor difference. I’d pick this guy for the price almost all the time. - Updates are spotty (fail often), slow, and difficult.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve owned several Turtle Beach headphones in the past, including the Stealth 700 Gen 2 Max and Stealth Pro. While they\'ve all been pretty good, I\'ve eventually steered off from them to others, such as my Planar Magnetic ones, which have been my go-to, here recently. Problem is...they\'ve extremely heavy, so as much as I love the audio quality and such, they tend to get very uncomfortable after about 30-40 minutes of use. So, I seen that Turtle Beach just launched their new Stealth 700 Gen 3\'s and decided to give them a try, as comfort has never been an issue for me with Turtle Beach, in the past! Let me say that I\'m so glad I got these! As someone with a hearing disability (in my right ear), I almost always gravitate towards earbuds. But for gaming, headsets tend to be 95% of the options. My issue is with headphones, the overall volume ""overhead"" is pretty small, so even when nearing max volume, they still don\'t get very loud - especially on the PS5. Well, I\'m happy to say that is not an issue with these Stealth Gen 3\'s! As for the unboxing experience, it\'s pretty standard for Turtle Beach, if you\'ve had their products before. I do love their new-ish purple/black colorway they\'ve started using over the past year or so. The box is sealed on 3 sides, so once you break through that, it neatly unfolds, unveiling the headset inside. Everything is wrapped in a white ""bag"" looking material, including the USB dongles. Inside the box is the headset, two dongles (which is what this package is all about and a USB-C charging cable. After unboxing, I immediately put them on charge. They must have been pretty low on charge, out of the box, because it seemed like it took several hours for it get topped off. Also, I want to say that the charge light on this thing is BRIGHT! It\'s probably one of the brightest LED charge lights I\'ve seen on any device I\'ve ever had, lol. While charging, it glows a red-ish amber color and when fully charged, the light (thankfully) goes off. It was recommended to do the initial firmware update of the headset via the Swarm II app. Turtle Beach now allow OTA (Over-The-Air) updates, which was one huge plus for me, I\'ve always hated having to plug everything in to do the manual Firmware updates. So, I plugged one dongle into my PS5 and the other into my laptop, the app detected the headset and both dongles. It began the update and after about 17%, crashed. So, I force closed it and it proceeded back to updating and was successful. It took it about 15 min or so, all said and done, for all three pieces to get updated (headset and both dongles). Overall, this was a pretty seamless experience and I\'m glad to see Turtle Beach finally going this route - it\'s way more convenient, especially for console players! Once updated, I went in and set the ""Mode"" to Bass and Treble boost as this is the way, lol. Either that or set a ""smiley"" EQ, which has always sounded good on TB Headsets for me in the past. The first thing I noticed was how LOUD these things get. After several hours of playing Astrobot (the new one) with them, I had to turn them down to....40%. Yes, I have a hearing disability and anything beyond 50% volume was almost uncomfortable for me. Depending on the game, 40%-46% seems to be the sweet spot. On both the PS5 and PC. Usually, headsets sound much louder on PC than PS5, but not here! They are equal on both and this makes me so happy! Now, the star of the show! The dual-USB dongles! WOW. These are amazing and work way better than they should have any right to. Hitting the button on the headset IMMEDIATELY switches them to the other device. I had a game active on both my PS5 and PC and as soon as I hit the button, it went active to the other dongle. Yep, no waiting for it to connect or anything. INSTANT. Honestly, this was a very pleasant surprise and further cemented my love for this product. Audio quality is superb and again, it gets very loud. At max settings, it\'s loud enough that for an extended period of time, could potentially cause some hearing issues. So yeah, maybe don\'t do that, lol. BUT....I\'d much rather have them like this, with PLENTY of overhead, instead of being toned down and not getting loud enough. I\'ve tested these out with Astrobot, Space Marine II, Vampire Survivors, Black Myth: Wukong, Call of Duty and Elden Ring. All games sounded fantastic and I even had to tone-down the in-game audio for Modern Warfare III. Also, super quick - Battery life has been great and as advertised. I\'ve logged about 30 hours on these. They\'re rated for about 80 on a single charge and I\'ve nowhere near that. No issues holding charge or anything. Fantastic! Now, for just a few complaints and this is just mostly me nitpicking. Firstly, I hated how these were advertised. There\'s an Xbox Version, a PlayStation Version and a PC Version. The Xbox is fine, it\'s the normal Xbox version that works on PC. Same with the PlayStation - it works on PC too and also comes in White. BUT...the PC version has higher bit-rate options for the audio AND mic and let me tell you, at least for the mic, it does make a noticeable difference on PC. Initially, this made my decision between the PS and PC version very difficult. I just don\'t get why the PlayStation version exists. Just make the Xbox one and the PC one, which also works on PlayStation. If you have a PlayStation system, just get the PC version, unless you want the White color. Secondly (and lastly), the dongles. They\'re both regular USB-A. I\'d love to have seen one being USB-C and the other being USB-A, for versatility. Or both USB-C and just giving us two A to C cables. Why do I mention this? Because on the PS5 Slim (and upcoming Pro), there is no USB-A port in the front and only two in the back - of which one is being used by an external SSD for my PS4 games. This means that being in the back, I can\'t see the connection LED or know that\'s it\'s muted when I flip the mic (the LED turns red). It\'s fine on PC, obviously, but this just seems to be awkward on the PS5 slim, since both front ports are USB-C... Overall though, nitpicking aside, I\'m giving these a 5/5 star! I love them and can see them quickly overtaking my Planar Magnetic headphones as my daily driver, simply because they\'re just soooo much more comfortable, what with the weight and the memory foam ear cushions.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Once again Turtle beach has designed and made a good headset. The headset is comfortable to wear and has clear ad crisp sound. The microphone is slick and tucks away nicely. 2 USB transmitters allow to have it connected to 2 diffrend devices so no need to keep unplugging, a switch on the headset allows to effortlessly change between the two. The headset being Bluetooth is nice as there is no wires to navigate.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] To be honest it has been a minute since switching back to Turtle Beach gaming headsets. I have been using Corsair’s HS60 and HS70’s over the past couple of years due to the upgrades in Sound and battery life. I heard about the new Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3’s and there improvements on both Sound, cross play, and battery life and couldn’t wait to put them to the test. Let’s get into it… Starting with comfort, these baby’s have a balanced weight to it and adjust nicely to my slightly above average medium sized head. Note: I can’t vouch for those who have extra large domes, but there seems to be room to spare to accommodate. The head band seems durable compared to most headsets out there. I remember this being a problem back when I owned a pair of turtle beach’s in the past. It is great to see this has been improved. The ears are roomy using a hybrid of leatherette and athletic weave fabric as well as memory foam cushions for comfort. I would consider my ears above average in size making it difficult to wear some headphones long periods of time. After gaming for nine hours straight I am happy to say they still feel comfortable without irritation. Sound quality: Dang! These baby’s sound incredible! There 60mm dual drivers create clean rich quality sound to hear an approaching player while delivering quality bass that is adjustable with Turtle Beach’s Swarm II app. With the app you have many options to customize the sound to your liking. The standard default settings alone sound amazing. I still can’t believe these have 80 hours of battery life! On a single charge so far I am at 23 hours of game play and these baby’s are still rocking strong, which surpasses any headsets I have purchased in the past regardless of the battery life promise. A new feature for me which is pretty cool is the cross-play ability to switch from my PlayStation 5 to my PC with a press of a button. This feature works flawlessly as well as the Bluetooth ability to use discord to chat with your teammates while playing in game with easy adjustability volume controls for both voice and game play. The mic seems compact and durable with the flip to mute option capability. Overall, I am really impressed with the comfort, sound quality, and long battery life. For what’s out there on the market for a similar retail, these are top notch with the ability to customize your overall experience. A+ for you Turtle Beach!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3 are a good set of headphones with some novel features. Dual connectivity dongles and over the air connection to the Swarm 2 mobile app, are great benefits. Audio quality is exceptionally good. The audio is punchy, loud, and detail rich. Positional audio in games works well. The microphone sound is a bit muffled for my taste, the headset update process is a bit cumbersome, and the headset can get a bit warm on the head after a bit. Still, this is a good headset. I am impressed with the audio quality and breadth of features. Setup: Inside the box, you get the headset, two wireless USB dongles, and a USB-C to USB-A charging cable. My headset required an update out of the box. I used the SWARM 2 mobile app for my updates, but you should know that your dongles will need to be plugged in to two different devices in the same room while you update your headset. This is where I should speak about the app experience for a bit. You can customize the audio mix for the headphones and the microphone from the phone application. I really appreciated the ability to do everything I used to do with a desktop application from my phone. You get the benefit of a consistent audio experience no matter the source and one less application to load on the PC. Now there is a Swarm application for PC, but, honestly, I prefer the mobile application. My PC has enough applications along the taskbar. Experience: Audio quality and battery life are really this headset’s claim to fame. Positional audio works very well with the Dolby Atmos spatial audio enabled on Windows 11, and the 60mm drivers allow these speakers to get plenty loud. I found the headset more than loud enough during PC play sessions at 40 percent volume. Whether I was listening to music, TV, or games, I cannot say enough about how good the audio quality was while listening to this headset. I have truly been impressed with the audio quality. The wireless dongle toggle works well allowing you to switch between devices with a push of a button. I also like that the dongle itself has an LED indicator to let you know if the microphone is disabled or enabled. The headset has Bluetooth 5.2 built in. I evaluated the headset on gaming consoles and on a TV. Bluetooth works well. I noticed no syncing problems or latency issues. Battery life has been great. With a solid week of evening game and movies, I still have not had to charge the headset. Turtle Beach advertises that this headset will get 80 hours on a charge, and I believe them. The headset feels okay on my head, but my ears got warm during extended play sessions. This is a nitpick, but a cooler mesh option for the ear cushions would have been preferable to the cushions that come included by default. Also, the microphone sound is a bit off to me. Audio sounded a bit muffled for my taste, but I am still playing with the equalizer and hope I can get that a bit better. Conclusion: This is a solid headset. Audio quality and battery life are great. Bluetooth, multiple dongles, and a solid phone app experience elevate this headset above similar options. The firmware update process is a bit cumbersome, and I may change out the foam pads in the future, but nitpicks aside, this is an easy headset to recommend. 4.5/5', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this PC gaming headset from Turtle Beach. I love them. It is wireless/Bluetooth, and it is compatible for Playstation,xbox,PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile. It surrounds sound as well and has a strap instead as the regular padding. The sound quality is very good and has a ""superhuman hearing"" option to enhance the experience. The mic is really good quality, and it can gl up for when you\'re not using it . It looks very slick and blends well with the headset. I\'d said this product is a 10/10 and a MUST have as a Gamers. Especially if you don\'t wanna deal with Wire headset. I totally recommend this product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound is very clear. This headset is mostly comfortable to wear but it’s a little big, not bad that it’s big but it does feel a little heavy. The padding is pretty comfortable though. The only thing I wish was that this set was more versatile- and could be used for x box as well! Great battery life. No lagging. Controls on the side kind of get on my nerves because I accidentally hit them when adjusting the headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me start off by saying I use this headset for My PC & PS4. When I play my WOW the mic is good when speaking to my team players. It’s also good when speaking in it when using for my COD. The comfort is good and not too tight for my big head . I love that is bluetooth connection and it goes on mute when not used so I can switch from my gaming to music which is so cool. The battery life last for hours which is great when I’m in grinding mode listening to music. Overall for the price being high, I do believe it’s worth it.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve tested many headsets in my day and the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3 while impressive in some aspects, still has a few drawbacks that makes me wary from giving it 5 stars, however I think the pros definitely outshine the cons. Lets do a pro and con list. Pros: - The audio quality. No joke probably one of the only headsets i\'ve tried that legitimately sounds great out of the box. No tuning needed. These are 60mm drivers as well which as far as I know is some of the biggest drivers out there. - Comfy and big I have pretty big ears and my ears fit comfortably inside. While I did enjoy these earpads, they do overheat after a long session. Headset can also adjust to big heads. -Build quality. These look and feel nice. I am in love with the style of this headset, super sleek. -Headset mic. Sounds great, honestly. Better than 99% headset mics. -Battery. This thing lasts. Advertised 80 hour battery life and as far as I can tell, its accurate. -Comes with two 2.4hz connections. This allows to easily switch between a 2.4 connection from PC to an xbox or pc with a touch of a button. Pretty cool. Connection was also solid throughout the house. -Bluetooth. Specifically simultaneous. Definitely a nice plus in headsets nowadays. You can connect to your pc and your phone and easily hear notifications. Cons: - Software. Unfortunately like 90% of gaming headsets the software is just so disappointing. You can do the basics like change and adjust EQ with a few presets but thats about it. Theres supposedly some way to use chatmix but I couldn\'t find it. Also alot of unexplained adjustments like ""Superhuman hearing"" as far as I can tell it just boosts audio so you can hear footsteps but honestly it sounds so terrible I can\'t even recommend using it. - Weird Audio bug on pc? I had a situation where audio would stop coming through my headset but still play on my pc. Turning off the ""Waves"" enhancement on my pc seemed to fix this issue. Not sure if this was just my pc. -Weight of the headset. Definitely pretty heavy. I tend to like my headset on the heavier side but this was a little too heavy for my taste. -Weird setup? Perhaps this is fixed but the headsets required a firmware update that could only be performed through downloading the swarm app on the phone. There is also a Swarm PC app but that does not appear to work for the update. Conclusion: The quality of this headset shines very much. The build and feel alone are worth the price. If you care about audio and don\'t mind subpar software (with some possible bugs), I definitely think these are probably the best on the market right now. Plus, the software is receiving updates pretty frequently. If I could i\'d give this around 4.5 stars right now but because i can\'t and because of the potential, I lean towards 5 stars.']"
JBL Tune 520BT On-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$49.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-tune-520bt-on-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-black/17857921/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Another great product from JBL. JBL Tune 520BT Headphones are very well designed and simple to use. Very well packaged as well as graphics on box. The moment I unboxed I realized these were solidly built and designed which I am accustomed to from JBL. Packaging was on point with a quick and easy setup manual. Headphones were charged and ready go right out of the box. Easy to setup and connect to blue tooth. The Tune 520BT sound was very good from a basic easy to use headphones. They seemed to block out surrounding noise. I would like to try on a flight and see how they perform. I definitely believe if your looking for well priced and easy to use headphones with good build and sound quality these are a no brainer. The only negative is I wish they came with a better storage bag or case for protection when not in use or putting them in a book bag. These would be great for kids and teens. I definitely will use as my go to headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound on these headphones are absolutely amazing! Such great quality! The amount of time the battery last for is great too! Charging doesn't take too long and is easy to do. Connecting to Bluetooth is simple. The only thing I could see as a downfall is some people may not like the size of the ear pieces. They are on the smaller size."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones for music high on bass the app is a plus you have control over your settings at any time this is a very cool tool Seems like is a noise canceling headphones because I can’t hear outside noise even on low volume', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used these headphones for a few days now and for the price, I am very impressed. Decent padding on the top and ears. I can wear them comfortably for hours. The blue tooth range is good because I move from rooms to rooms without disconnection (upstairs) If I go down stairs, I lost connection. The sound is better than I expected for the price. Lyrics are clear and base is deep. The ability to connect the JBL Tune 520 BT to multiple devices simultaneously, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, makes my lives a lot easier because I connect them with my work computer and my phone. The only complaint I have is the charging cable is a bit too short.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using this JBL Tune 520 BT headphones for about 10 days. So far the best for the price in terms of build quality, sound quality, features and options it has. The box is included with the cable for charging. The best part is it has a JBL app supporting these headphones using which we can customize some of the settings and the setup is very easy. Coming to wearing it for a longer time is also good without any complaints with its long-lasting battery and feather kind of light weight. Coming to sound quality and bass is great for the price. It has the option of a multipoint connection, like connecting to 2 devices at a time and switching between them, but I found it a little hard to switch and there was no clear info about it. Other than that, the rest of the things are absolutely great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around experience. I enjoy using these headphones while in the office or chores around the house. They block out just enough sound without making me feel like I am missing anything going on around me. Very easy to connect to my phone and computer. The sound quality has been perfect for both music and podcasts. They are a good weight to where I do not feel bogged down while wearing. I look forward to using these when I need a little me time in the office.', ""The JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones are the best headphones I've had so far, the sound quality is sensational and they soundproof perfectly. They have a built-in microphone and volume control in the earpiece, which is very convenient to use. These are wireless earphones that connect via Bluetooth, and additionally work with the Google Assistant, so you can control them with your phone using voice commands. They last over 50 hours on a single charge and can be connected to a phone and a laptop at the same time. They are very comfortable to use - they have soft inserts and a headband with a large range of adjustment, and the headphones are foldable, thanks to which they can be easily packed into a purse or backpack. I use headphones every day to listen to music, give tutoring or talk on the phone and in each of these options they work great. Sometimes even children use them when they want to listen to their favorite children's songs and they are also delighted. I highly recommend :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tune 520 are over-ear headphones, made of plastic with faux-leather earcups. Like I said they’re very lightweight and the earcup padding is plush, but the clamping force is pretty high so those with larger heads (like me) will be uncomfortable after even a moderate listening session. Those with normal-sized heads might feel differently. Overall, the construction seems pretty good. The controls on the 520 are straightforward and similar to other JBL units. There are buttons on the right ear cup to help you turn the phones on and off, adjust volume, skip tracks forward and backwards, play/pause audio. The power button is also used for Bluetooth, and the upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 is a nice addition. The headphones support multi-point connection, which means that they can connect to two devices. Charging is handled by USB-C. You can also adjust the equalization using the JBL Headphones app. The 520s delivered very balanced sound out of the box. It was extremely flat, but connecting to the app allows you to tailor them to your liking. Stereo separation is great and the bass extension in the app provides a ton of punch. It took me a little while, but I was able to get the equalizer set to my liking. Bottom line: The JBL Tune 520 are a nice way to break into JBL headphones. They’re super lightweight, the battery life is tremendous, and if you like bass you’ll love these headphones. The ability to tailor the sound using JBL’s app (which I really like) is a big plus for headphones in this price range. You just better have a smaller head.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable, crisp, light weight and sleek. I like how they aren't bulky, I don't feel like they are wearing me..simple buttons with function. They are very comfortable on my ears for hours. They definitely have good bass sound for my daily tracks I wouldn't recommend for a bass enthusiast but they do enhance the bass in my tracks to make it sound crisp."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Starting off, the packaging is perfectly done with a good presentation. It’s strait to the point while keeping wasteful extras to a minimum. The build quality, this is something that is super important with headphones intended to be used every day. After vigorously testing and using these over a week, there is no apparent weakness and these are very well made while maintaining a super light weight. The adjustments above the ear cups are the only gripe found with these but once set in a comfortable spot they seem to stay there. Now, the most important part, the sound quality. As expected from JBL, the sound signature is near perfect strait out of the box. There is adjustable EQ capabilities on the app which brings the headphones to a new level. Punchy lows and crispy highs, these keep your tunes fresh for hours on end. The extremely respectable battery life on these outshine any others. I forgot to even charge these for the majority of the time using them so far. To finalize this, I can say without a doubt, these are a smart purchase for any average listener or school goers who need an extra upgrade in sound. I wouldn’t recommend these for any heavy movement activities but they do stay in place pretty well.']"

A free app is available for JVC Headphones that enables complete sound customization, a welcome addition. There are 3 memory positions, so you can save 3 favorite audio curves & switch them wirelessly, directly from the headphones. My favorite features of these headphones are their amazing comfort fit & lightweight design. You can wear them for hours without fatigue!

They perform at the top of the mid priced headphones & earn my recommendation.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When JVC's Over-the-Ears Noise-Cancelling Wireless Headphones, Model # HA-S75N, first arrived, I thought that there might be some mistake. The box was so light, I thought someone had removed the headphones. I was wrong. Upon opening the box, I found the lightest pair of over-the-ear headphones that I have ever encountered. I immediately placed them to charge via the provided USB C cable, being careful to read the instructions which say to use a 5V type charger. Since it was late, I allowed the headphones to charge overnight. The next day, after further reading of the setup leaflet that came in the box, I was quickly able to connect the headphones via Bluetooth to both my computer and cell phone. A voice notification will tell you when you are connected and what mode you are in. I placed the headphones on my head and easily adjusted them to my size. The headphones were so light and comfortable that I almost forgot that I had them on. JVC products has had a long-standing reputation for reproducing excellent sound quality. These headphones keep to that JVC tradition. While listening to some YouTube videos, the sound from my computer was clear and crisp I then used them for a quick Zoom meeting with my sister. She sounded great through them and she said the sound from my built-in microphone was clear and pleasant. I then had her call me on the phone. Again the sound was clear and sharp on both sides. At this point, I downloaded the JVC Headphones application onto my phone. You can view the full Instruction Manual on the application. The app allows you to control both Phone and Music volume separately. It allows you to turn the Noise Cancelling On / Off or switch to Ambient Sound. Among other things, it allows you to switch the Sound mode between FLAT, BASS & CLEAR and gives you 3 Custom equalizer presets for whatever your sound situation presents. Once I had the application, I connected to my music player and the sound through the HA-S75N's was awesome! The application also clearly indicates how much battery life you have via percentage and icon. Though I haven't used these headphones long enough to run out of battery, the are listed has having 50 hours of battery life if in Ambient and Normal mode and 35 hours of battery life in Noise Cancelling mode. There is a voice notification when the battery is getting low. If you are looking for a pair of great sounding, Noise Cancelling, extremely lightweight and comfortable, over-the-ears headphones with long battery life, then the JVC Over-the-Ears Wireless Headphones, Model # HA-S75N are a best bet!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the JVC HA-S75N Wireless Headphones with Noise Cancelling. Unboxing and setup were easy. While charging for a couple of hours, I downloaded the JVC Headphones app and reviewed the online manual. Once the headphones were fully charged, I paired them with my iPhone, connected to the app, and then paired them again with my desktop computer. The headphones are very lightweight and comfortable. I wore them for five hours without any discomfort. The ear cups fully cover my ears. Both sides of the headband are adjustable for height, and the top of the headband is cushioned. The construction is made of molded plastic, which is durable but has a toy-type quality feel. The buttons respond with a distinct click. The button indicators are hard to see since they're also of the same black embossed color. Same with the L/R indicators on the sides of the headband. I was amazed at how quiet the headphones are with the Noise Cancelling turned on. I use the headphones to listen to music and sounds from my desktop computer while working and gaming. I like having the ability to set the sound levels and equalizer from my phone while listening to music on my desktop. The sound is fairly crisp, though the bass tends to be muddy. I am happy with the headphones. The noise cancelling, and the sound quality is fairly decent for the price. Features • Read through online manual • Lightweight at 182 grams • Noice cancelling and Ambient noise modes • Up to 35 hours playtime with noise cancelling, max. 50 hours • Recharges in 3 hours • JVC Headphones app for Android/iOS • Normal, Bass, Clear, and custom sound EQ settings • Frequency range: 20 - 20,000 Hz • Magnet type: neodymium • Bluetooth 5.3 • USB-C • Can pair with two devices • SBC, AAC Audio formats"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JVC’s wireless noise canceling headphones are not the premium type but they are very well built. It is mostly made of plastic and the ear cup foam feels like a soft vinyl material. They are extremely light, one of the lightest I have used. So lightweight, you’ll hardly notice them on your head. Thanks to that lightweight they are also very comfortable. On the left ear cup it houses the power button and the USBC charging port. On the right it has the volume, noise canceling and the multifunction button (MFB). The setup is fairly simple: just turn them on and pair it. It can be paired directly from the Bluetooth settings on your mobile, tablet or PC without the requirement of an app. However, the benefit of using the JVC Headphone app will give you access to the device’s settings and ability to customize the multi function button (MFB) and other settings. The best part of the app is there's no need to create an account. When it comes to sound quality they don’t disappoint. They sound very good and they are loud for headphones at this price range. However, both the bass and noise canceling (ANC) could use some improvement. The bass has a bit of kick but not deep enough in my opinion. Even with the bass sound mode selected, the bass felt the same as the flat option, just slightly different. Same goes for the noise canceling (ANC) and ambient mode. Toggling between noise canceling and ambient sound there’s also a slightly noticeable difference. During phone calls it sounds really good and very clear. I did notice during phone calls the ambient sound became very apparent. I am not sure if that is a normal behavior or a glitch.The ambient noise does not sound like that when listening to music. It was very noticeable and it sounded good. I became very aware of my surroundings when the ambient sound was activated during calls. I really appreciate that the functionality of the app is very simple to use. One I really liked the most was the ability to customize the power and (MFB) buttons. You can make both buttons do multiple functions when it comes to controlling music and answering phone calls. You can even summon voice assistants. Overall these JVC’s noise canceling are very capable mid range headphones. They are extremely light and very comfortable, and can be worn for a long period. With 35 hrs of battery life they can go for several days without needing a charger. In the box you get the JVC headphone, short USB-A to USB-C cable and manuals."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] TLDR: Very comfortable over-ear, (NC) Noise Cancelling, very high quality true wireless headphone from a reputable sound manufacturer, JVC model HAS75NB. Enables wireless Bluetooth or wired use, has folding flat design, swivel-in for compact storage and lasts 50 hours on a charge w/o NC and 35 hours with Noise Cancelling on. It works with phone voice assistants. Includes a short USB-A to USB-C charge wire. The low price belies the extreme value this model provides. The sound quality is superb, the noise cancelling is very strong and the comfort level in use is ideal. In use for phone calls the received sound and transmitted sound is always clear and resonant and no one knows or comments that I sound off when using these headphones. It effectively blocks out outside noise when used in the noisy clang of the gym environment with constant background music, many people talking, loud group classes in session and the general sound of metal weights and other equipment. Per the supplied fold-out single large sheet instruction sheet, the right side has a 3-position push switch which offers 3 settings: Normal/Bass/Clear for sound settings. [Note: it seems JVC does not offer an app with this model that allows adjusting the sound tone equalizer settings for the headphone & upload firmware upgrades. I mention that since other premium brands do that.] It also does not include a carry case or pouch.] In outside environments, the blissful effect of blocking out street noise, vehicle rumble and other annoying noises while enjoying a relaxing lunch break away from a busy work environment is a major reason to buy full ear covering headphones. These JVC HAS75NB surely perform in that measure. It has large 40mm drivers for each ear to generate the great musical sounds. The large, padded ear pads effectively block out most noise and the electronic ANC Automatic Noise Cancellation circuit removes most of the remaining noise. The built-in microphone allows using “OK Google” or “Hey Google” on my Android phone to call anyone in my contacts list, to increase or decrease phone playback volume or to ask anything such as weather reports or any other google search topic. As above, everyone stated I sounded clear using this headphone on phone calls. It runs Bluetooth 5.3 which in my experience means the range is well in excess of the stated 10 meters (30 feet) and exceeds close to 100 feet with no obstructions between phone and headphone as tested at an outdoor pool deck. The JVC allows a multi-point connection feature such as for a phone and a computer with Bluetooth. With my Samsung phone on Bluetooth and my Gigabyte laptop on Bluetooth connected as “Device 1” and “Device 2” I can hit play on either the phone or computer to start the sound. The device that hits play last is the one heard through the headphone. Hitting play on the other stops the first and starts the 2nd. It is not water resistant nor waterproof; no claims to that were made by JVC per the printed documentation supplied. As stated above, JVC does not supply a protective storage case nor a storage pouch with this model.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Among the over-the-ear headphones currently on the market, these headphones reside in the decidedly middle ground, albeit at an affordable price point. As most are aware, JVC is a well-known brand name that has not been quite as popular and significant a player in the top-notch performance category for this market segment. Let’s see how they do. From the unboxing, anticipation and inspection, came the realization that these headphones are not revolutionary, not cutting edge, and do not have a surplus of unique features. However, at the friendly price point that these cans are coming from, these headphones represent a low-cost (relatively speaking) noise-cancelling, sound isolating (or not, as they are switch-selectable), very good-sounding alternative to other more expensive leading brands. Regarding features of these phones, they come with only a very short USB-C to USB-A charging cord. Lacking, is a travel pouch or case that might corral the cord and headphones together for safer travels. A feature that I use all the time while traveling by air with different noise cancelling headphones, is a 3.5 mm corded connection to allow use of seatback screens available on longer distance flights. Without this feature, these headphones limit your entertainment to what you may have previously downloaded to a Bluetooth-enabled source device, due to the poor performance and undependability of WIFI on airplanes. The headphones are also capable of use for taking or making clear-sounding telephone calls. Physically, these headphones are fairly light and comfortable, but may prove fatiguing over longer-term use depending on head size and shape. The clamping force is a bit high, the headband is narrow, and is not very well padded. The earcups are not very flexible from an articulating perspective, as they will rotate in one direction to lay flat, but will not rotate/fold to allow more compact storage. The Left/Right markings on the headband are also poorly marked and difficult to see. Lastly, attaining the headphone’s remaining power level is only accessible from the app in that when powering on, there is no remaining battery power estimation revealed on an internally-generated spoken voice as competing models offer. However, battery life is claimed to be a long 50 hours with a Bluetooth connection and without noise cancelling and 35 hours with Bluetooth and noise cancelling engaged. The Bluetooth version is 5.3, which is current as of this writing. A lithium battery is employed and requires at least 3.5 to 10 watts of power for the rated charging time of three hours. The limited warranty is stated as one year for both parts and labor with the serial number hidden under the left earcup’s pad just in case you need to refer to it. The noise-cancelling is effective, but does not sound quite as effective as several of the highest-rated headphones. There is also an option located on the same switch as the noise cancelling, that allows for ambient sound to be heard for safety and enhanced peripheral awareness. With a steady wind blowing, the ambient-detecting microphones reveal wind noise, but not excessively. There is an app available called “JVC Headphones” that is currently poorly rated with thirteen, one-star reviews claiming that the app doesn’t recognize most of the JVC products. However, as of this writing, it has recently been updated and when I tried it, it did recognize this newer model of headphones and allows for control and monitoring of the features of the headphones. The app seems to be working well now, so I wouldn’t be giving much credence to the relevance of past reviews, as it seems most of the issues have been addressed. Although the headphones allow simple, on-unit button control of the EQ in the form of a “Flat/Bass/Clear” button, the app will also allow the creation of three, custom equalization presets taken in the form of three points of parametric equalization that sets the volume, frequency and Q (width of frequency affected) for each preset. So, you should be able to tailor these phones to your liking through these controls, although for the unfamiliar, there will be a slight learning curve. The over-all sound for me was very good when compared to more expensive headphones. I didn’t hear any bothersome excessive accentuations or lack of response in any sonic areas. With a little custom adjustment via the app, a sound curve can probably be achieved to accommodate one’s desired sound. The microphone sound for phone use was also reported as being clear and well-articulated. If some of the shortcomings of this model are a deal-breaker, consider the older, pricier, JVC HAS100N that comes with a case, two-way articulating earcups and a 3.5 mm corded connection, but uses the older 5.0 Bluetooth connection and has only 25 hours of battery power with cordless, and 22 hours with the addition of ANC use. With those features and a price differentiation of two to three times the price, the HAS75NB seems like a bargain compared to the HAS100N. If you only need the addition of the corded connection capability, the slightly more costly HA-S95N with the same battery charge capability and most other features might be of interest.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JVC has produced many great audio over my life. They range from affordable to high end products. This audio cancelling headphones fall into the afforded range. So setup was super duper easy. Charge it up. Turn it on and link using Bluetooth and you are all set. No app required. Button use is super simple. Audio cancelling or ambient pass through on and off with 1 button. Volume up and down easy. Different sequences for long short button to do different things. Fit is good and comfy. Lightweight so easy to wear for long periods. Also battery life is phenomenal. 1 charge goes a long way. So audio cancelling is just ok. It does reduce significantly but not completely. Which is good and bad. Good if you want surrounding awareness for safety reasons. Bad if you want complete silence as I did not get that. Also 1 small issue that I encounter was my kid was taking Saxophone lesson and he hit a high F in his scale and it resonates in the audio cancelling mode (in other words it passed through and created a crackle in the headphones) . With that in mind these headphones would be a budget noise cancelling headphones knowing the limitations that I found.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Unboxing was easy and straightforward. It included the headphones in a small USBC to USB A cable. I charged them just to make sure they were ready for use. Setup was pretty straight forward. I powered them on and paired them through my phone. There were no additional prompts for an app to download or anything. Use: They played music good and clear around the house. I found them to be really light and comfortable. When I took them to the gym, I found them to easily slide off my head even when just doing the weight machines. This is frustrating since that is one of the main scenarios I use over the ear headphones. I tried to tighten the headband, but they still slid easily. The ANC was pretty good in ambient mode I can still hear my surroundings pretty good so if someone talks to me or I need to pay attention to someone I can. With the Noise Cancelling mode I found the sound blocked out the environment and I was able to focus on the music only. I did try to take a few meetings with these to test the microphone quality. I was able to hear the caller and they were able to hear me. When my family was nearby the caller did not hear them but just me. That is a sign to me they are quality. I did also like the sound mode of Clear the best. I did not feel like Bass added any better sound to the music I listened to and Flat is not a profile I would use. Even during a voice dialog. I would use clear. I did not use the buttons on the headset since I find them hard to find when trying to answer or end a call, so I typically use my phone or computer. If I had to make a request it would be to see them give more control to the fit over your head and make the call control buttons easier to find when feeling them on the side of your head.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones have a pleasant aesthetic; nothing extraordinary but stylish enough to wear on any occasion. This set is made of plastic and quite light, but somehow does not feel cheap. The headband is somewhat flexible and very thin. However, it is well cushioned. The pleather earpads are super soft. I found the headset comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time. The tactile controls are in easy-to-reach places and intuitive. The headset fold inward but do not collapse. Overall, the build quality is decent, but I wouldn’t want to expose it to harsh treatment. The HA-S75NB feature Bluetooth 5.3, so pairing them was easy, I did not experience any disconnects or hiccups, even at a distance. The controls handle everything, so there is no reason to reach for the device. The battery is excellent at 35-50 hours depending on noise cancelling or ambient modes. I had these for some days, and it is still at 45% charged. It takes 3 hours to fully charge from 0% and sadly there is no quick charge option. The call quality is OK. Indoors, the audio is good and I was heard clearly. Outdoors, the headset did pick up some wind noise and other ambient sounds, but again, I was able to carry a conversation with no real issues. The noise cancelling is not the best to be frank. While it will cancel some noise, I was surprised to hear lower sounds like an airplane flying or a bus passing by. It works well for crowds. The ambient mode is good with no harsh amplification, and helpful when needed. Now, the best thing about these cans is the audio quality. While there are only SBC and AAC codecs offered, the 36mm drivers at the “normal” setting deliver a warm, pleasant sound signature that goes well with any genre. The bass has impact and even some depth without being sloppy. The midrange is present making vocals and rhythm instruments pop, and the treble soars without being harsh or sibilant. Just in case you need a little extra bass or treble for clarity, there are 2 more presets to choose from. The channel separation is well-defined, the soundstage is expanse, and the imaging is distinct. Overall, it is very nice tuning. So, I think at the end of the day the HA-S75NB offers very good audio experience and options. While the ANC may not be the best, the decent value is undeniable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the JVC Over-The Ear Headphones for about a week now. These wireless headphones are pretty easy to get set up and start using. What’s included is the headphones, a charging cord and the instructions. The first thing you want to do is attach the cord to the left side of the headphones and plug into a USB charging block and then charge for the recommended 3 hours for the first time. Once it is charged you hold down the power button to activate the Bluetooth and it will then flash quickly. I had to read the instructions to figure this out. There isn’t anything that clearly displays the Bluetooth symbol. Once you are connected to your device - you will need to get used to the buttons on the right ear piece. There are three buttons. Volume, Noise Canceling, and MFB which does something different based on how many times you push it. One to fours times. It takes a little getting used to - but then is becomes habit. The headphones are very comfortable. You can turn on Noise canceling or listen to ambient sound. And you can switch between your phone calls and music. Definitely a decent headphone and I would recommend.']"
Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset with Microphone - White,$185.57,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/corsair-void-rgb-elite-wireless-gaming-headset-with-microphone-white/17342399/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these about a year ago. I had to pick them based on online reviews due to the pandemic. The sound is great. They are not very tight on my head. I have a medium sized head I'd say. If I move to fast they sway around. Additionally there was a tiny bolt in the right ear piece shaking around in there that I just removed today on my own. If it were not for the pandemic I would have tried to get a different pair but didn't feel like dealing with it then and lost track of time. So rather than ship them back to corsair I did it myself and got lucky. I keep these in a middle pocket of a laptop computer backpack and try to take good care of them. The battery length is optimal and they seem sturdy enough if you're not treating them like a barbarian."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset is truly a bargain, i got it for around 75$ Dollars 25 dollars off OM price and it is truly amazing, the headset looks beautiful and with that 16 hour battery life and around 5-8 hours usage a day its not amazing, but you can lower the lighting brightness through iCue, and it is truly amazing for the price, on sale or not. It has nice sounding drivers, amazing earcups (Doesn’t work for xbox though for you who wants to use it on xbox one to series, Playstation and Pc only.)', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very comfortable! Fits my head quite nicely! Quality Material! It can go very loud without distortion! Charges quickly! Great quality mic! Has RGB (but comes at a cost for battery life) Battery life is about 12-16 hrs. So here is the deal about the battery: 1) First charge took about an hour, I let it charge for 2 hours would not go past 96%. I received about 18 hours of audio (RGB off, brightness turned off and mic light was off(no red light)). 2) However, went from 96% to about 60% rather quickly(About 1- 2hrs). 3) Then stayed at 50-60% for about 2 hours. 4) Next stage went from 50% to 33% quickly (1-2 hrs). Stayed at about 30% for 2 hrs. At this stage at 30%, the audio started to become super choppy and rather annoying, every min or so sound would ""pop"" and/or ""crackle"". 5) Now, from 30% to 26% took about 2 hrs. (Audio continued to be ""poppy & crackling"". 6) Battery Life from 26% - 18% took about 2 hours. Stayed around 10-18% for about 1-2hrs. 7) I continued to use till about 2-5 % took about 2 hrs to go from 10-5% (same popping and cracking audio). Then called it a day and went for a full charge. I want to see what happens to the battery life and the ""battery level"" on a depleted/full charge. If I can edit and/or comment after review, I will post an update on charge time and usage time. 8) Update your headset firmware! I feel it is a must! 96 - 60% - 2hrs 50 - 60% - 2hrs + 2hr @ ~55% 50 - 33% - 2hrs + 2hr @ ~33% 26 - 18% - 2hrs 10 - 18% - 2hrs + 2hr @ ~18% 5 - 10% - 2hrs TOTAL: Approximately ~18hrs This is the second void elite wireless headset I have received. The first one I bought, I returned because the battery life was about 6 hours and audio was ""poppy and cracking"" almost the entire time of use. Now, to summarize: Would I recommend this headset? Absolutely! I rather enjoyed the headset. However, if you don\'t mind cords and/or USB extensions, I would definitely go with the wired version. You can get the RGB, the 7.1 surround sound, the excellent mic all w/o the battery problems.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Headset sounds and works great on PC/Mac, but note when using for PS4 your features are extremely limited. You can’t adjust the volume on the headset itself, the most you can do is turn on/off and mute the mic. If you are okay with that or are using mainly for PC then I would say go for it and buy them! Also, I must add that they fit kinda weird, very easily slide off your head and don’t completely cover your ears. It’s a bit of an awkward feel when wearing them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Is a good product I absolutely recommend!! And is good for gaming.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great sound for price I use for my pc and laptop love them', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this to replace my original wired Corsair Void RGB Headset after having it for over 5 years. It was replaced because the wires were starting to show from all the wear and tear. Plus the cord snagged on my chair all the time and that's what lead to the wires starting to be exposed. I like having the wired and wireless option and it's the same comfort and quality of the ones I replace. It's also nice to just plug in and the Corsair iCue software just uploaded all my settings. You can game all day without the headset getting uncomfortable or hurting after long sessions. I' a fan of Corsair products so I would recommend these over the competitors."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these headphones because I was having some microphone issues with my other headset in discord and thought that these headphones would be better. I was wrong, the audio quality is garbage. Yea, the dismal RGB on the side is cool-ish, but other than the color scheme, these headphones scored far below expectations for Corsair. Even with editing the audio settings in the ICUE software, it was like listening to music and all other audio through a cup. Very bad job on quality, I do not recommend these to anyone who actually wants to hear when other players are sneaking up on them in an FPS game or any other setting that requires at least some surround sound.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Fits great for people with big heads like myself. Sound quality is fantastic for its price as well. Note that the Corsair software to control the equalizer and RGB is quite barebones. Do your self a favor and use Razer Synapse 2.0 (the older version. The newer version only supports modern razer products while the older program supports third party products) for controlling the equalizer as Synapse 2.0 also has great options for controlling player voice and loudness unlike Corsairs software which I only use to control the RGB. For PS4 players, the usb charge cable will have to be used in the back of the console because the usb stick is a bit large. The console will automatically pair once the dongle is plugged into the USB slot, which fits in the front. Device last about 14-16 hours of constant use. 8/10 product.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this product because i have a corsair scimitar, and used to have some astro tr40 tournament edition wired headset, so i was very spoiled when it came to sound quality. I wasn't expecting alot for the price, but i was pleasantly surprised, the audio quality is pretty close to the wired tr40's and it's wireless! Total game changer here, It can definitely hang with the competition, we will see after a month or two of use but I'm very happy with this headset so far, and i was also surprised to see that it runs Spacial Sound, which is rare for a headset at this price! Definitely a steal! Don't order this shipped though it can get lost! Go curbside pick up or pick up in store.""]"

I had the original earbuds back when the company started out, ran over them with a fork lift to my dismay. I have owned 6 different products from House of Marley and I still use 5 of them to this day. So if anyone is reading this don't hesitate to buy. I have had the little bt speaker the liberate for going on 5 years, the Destiny TTRs for about 4 years and the Liberate XLs for about 3. All are still working superbly. Thank you to House of Marley for making great sounding, useful products."", 'Five Years ago, when I lived in UK, House of Marley headphones was easier to get for me. It used to hold more than one year and I never had problema with it. Sound quality is great, its comfy, the cord is something that makes you feel different from others.

Its still impossible to find your headphones in Lithuania though. But I will find a way, to get you in my hands again. Best wishes ❤️']"
JLab Studio On-Ear Sound Isolating Headphones - Black,$19.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jlab-studio-on-ear-sound-isolating-headphones-black/13607694/review,"['I’ve had them since may and I’m still in love with them Although they are very very snug so after a while it’s a little stress on my ear lobes but no worries', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These have definitely come in handy at night when I want to watch a show or movie on my laptop but don’t want to wake up my partner. I just plug them in, adjust the volume to the right level and I’m good to go. The sound is very clear and the headphones are so lightweight that it doesn’t even feel like I’m wearing them at times. One of my favorite parts about these headphones is that you can fold them up and carry them with you in your purse, book bag or anywhere else.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headphone is the perfect size for my 5-year-old, its band is also adjustable so I think this will be good for a while. The earmuffs are very comfortable and the sound quality is good. The audio plug-in needs to be pushed all the way in for the headphone to work (we thought it was broken until we figured this out). All in all this is a good accessory to get for your little one especially for online course and other use.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The studio on ear headphones fits perfectly on my ears. I like that the headphone is able to adjust to most people's ears. The cloud foam cushion is SUPER comfortable. My favorite part is the tangle free cord, on all my other headphones that was always a problem. I absolutely love that the headphone can be folded up for on the go. The music quality is great so overall this is an amazing product."", ""The sound quality is honestly great, and it's pretty sound-proof, you can barely hear the music coming outside of them. Depending on your settings, they're adjustable to an extend. But the product is too tight. It's pretty bearable at first, but within a few minutes of wearing it, it begins to press in so much that your ears start hurting really bad. Designed for kids or not, I am one, and it really hurts inside afterwards, like some sort of infection. It presses the tragus inwards, damaging it. It goes away within a few hours, but the aftermath is not very pleasant when you have to stop mid-listening to something because the pain gets unbearable."", 'Doing studio recordings I often have to wear headphones 6-9 hours a day. The ""click track"" headphones in the studio are heavy and painful against the outer ear. I\'ve used my own for years. Decided to give these a chance because they folded easily and fit in my horn case. No smashing. The sound is terrific, vibrant bass and treble; but the best feature, for me, is its comfort. Adjustable and feather-light, so soft I forget they\'ve been on for several hours. Bonus: The cord is wrapped in woven fabric and doesn\'t get tangled when I move around.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Enjoy ultimate comfort with the JLab Audio - Studio Wired On-Ear headphones. The soft cushion helps to keep the sound in while protecting the ear. In addition, the adjustable headband allows for flexibility and a perfect fit. I highly recommend the JLab Audio brand for your listening pleasure. If you travel frequently, then you know firsthand, that you will need these on the plane. If you seek privacy, during a ZOOM conference, then you will need these headphones as well. They are reasonably priced which is a WIN-WIN!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I don't know why these companies make headphones that feel like they're going to crush my head. This was painfully tight when I tried to wear it, making it impossible to use for more than a couple minutes. Also, the headphones are set in one position, so if your head isn't shaped juuuuust right, they fit very awkwardly. I can't even give a rating on the sound quality because I couldn't wear them for long enough to listen to much of anything, but I'd imagine anything that costs $15-20 is going to sound pretty terrible. Just spend the extra money and get a decent $50-ish pair of headphones. It'll be worth the investment."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these on a whim last year and have really enjoy them. The sound these produce is on-par with a lot of $99+ wireless headphones on the market. So much so that I've returned quite a few pairs of wireless headphones because of it. If they cannot out perform something that is $70 cheaper what's the point? I'm surprised that people have said these are volume limited as they get pretty loud and drown out background noise without any active noise isolation or cancelation. The only drawback that I have found is the built-in mic is just awful. That seems to be a consistent issues across the entire JLab line of headphones."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a user of solely true wireless earbuds for quite a while now, these are a huge improvement. These on-ear headphones have amazing sound quality, with a nice bass boost. The sound is accurate, and well balanced- no tinny sound. Just a wonderful feeling of being completely wrapped up in my favorite music :) The only disappointing thing? Wired headphones are on their way out and I have absolutely no way to use these on my favorite devices. Either way, I will be using them any time I am able. Great product. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone needing a pair of affordable headphones with amazing sound!']"

This fitment is also really good. I could run with these as compared to my JBL I have. It's also not irritating to the ears. The only con I have with this is the slow start up when placing them in the ear. A tad slow, doesn't have ear recognition.

They are well-built, look impressive, and in my opinion, deliver a truly immersive listening experience. With the right amplifier, the bass is deep, punchy, and detailed, while the mids and highs are clear and crisp. One thing I learned, unfortunately, is that these headphones reveal the flaws in most of my favorite tracks since they are not well-mastered (I was prepared for that). For the same reason, they let me easily distinguish each instrument in complex parts that previously blended together. I love how these headphones pull out all the details in tracks, which played a key role in my choice.

It dawned on me truly how long I’ve had them and I went online to see if they still sell them. I’m relieved. I will be buying more, whenever these decide to pass away. Sadly, they don’t sell the color I have anymore.

"JVC - Nearphones Wireless Headphones with Charging Case and Built-in Microphone, Black",$149.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-nearphones-wireless-headphones-with-charging-case-and-built-in-microphone-black/19194035/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As I opened the box, the JVC HA-NP1T earphones looked like two small pieces of fine jewelry made out of shiny black stones. The shape is unusual compared to traditional earphones. Connection and set-up were easy, but I needed to look at the manual to learn how to slip them on. However, I was pleasantly surprised to discover how comfortable and light they are. I barely noticed their presence even after wearing them all day at work. I like the open-ear design that is ideal for my office environment as I’m not cut off from the outside activities as I’m listening to my favorite music or podcasts. The battery life is good and, from a full charge, the charge would be a little 50% after almost seven hours of use. Ergonomically, those JVC earphones are among the most comfortable earphones I’ve owned. They hold on firmly yet gently to my ears. On a couple of occasions, I wore them during my exercise and they stayed in place even with constant sudden head movements. That’s a big plus for me, but I’m not sure about their level of waterproofing in case of heavy sweating. Unlike many modern earphones that have touch controls, this model operates with a single push button on each earphone that performs all the basic functions to play, pause, skip, volume and more. In my opinion, the buttons lack responsiveness and require practice to get the right results. They can be customized through the app which has a good and simple user interface. It’s stable and the connection to the earphones has been reliable. On the box, JVC printed ‘Nearphones’ which perfectly describe the way they sit outside the ear canal as opposed to traditional earphones. I’m assuming it’s a kind of bone conduction technology as the sound is clear and even immersive depending on what you’re listening to. The sound quality is great with podcasts and quite good when playing music. I’m guessing because of their placement outside the ear canal, you will notice a lack of bass but the highs come out almost perfect. In a noisy environment, it becomes a challenge to hear comfortably. They performed well while making calls, and the sound was clear. The microphone captured my voice well according to my interlocutors on the other lines. Overall, my experience with the JVC HA-NP1T Nearphones was mostly positive. They are not premium earphones and I believe touch controls would have made them more user-friendly or the push buttons could have been more responsive. However, they are very comfortable and they have style. You can wear them all day without getting ear fatigue and the quality of the sound can be qualified as good, especially with podcasts.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As someone who can’t wear earbuds, I’m always on the lookout for great alternatives. This season has brought a lot of outside the ear solutions from top brands, so I must not be alone in my aversion to in-ear pods! I have tried several iterations, and these “cuff” form factor ones are truly different. I have done the over ear, hooked, just outside the ear and others, but these are the best outside-the-ear headphones I’ve tried so far. They’re super comfortable and fit snugly around the edge of my ear, so I didn’t even notice I had them on all day. JVC does not skimp on sound quality. Highs and mids are clear and crisp, and I love that there’s an option to turn up the bass. It actually makes a difference and feels thumpy. Unlike my other outside-the-ear headphones, these don’t make the sound so loud that it bothers others around me. My wife cannot hear the music or podcast at all even sitting next to me. I’ve had no issues with the Bluetooth connection and have worn them on several outdoor walks, phone in my pocket. That is a big drawback to several other brands, but these stay connected. If you haven’t tried outside the ear buds before, even if you don’t “need” them, I’d still highly recommend trying them. You may make a switch!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been intrigued by and interested in picking up a pair of “open ear” headphones for quite some time now. As much as I love a closed ear, or in ear experience when listening to music or watching a movie sometimes I think having an open ear design is important for certain situations. I’ve been using mine when chatting with friends online, when I’m out for a walk, and when I go to bed to fall asleep. I need to hear my alarm when it goes off in the morning lol, and having these allows me to hear the alarm on my night stand when it goes off. I love the design of these, even though they feel a little strange at first.. Once you get them settled in a preferred position, they are very comfortable. Build quality is good. Not the most rugged feeling earphones. But I think they will last a good while as long as you dont slam them on the ground. The case is what feels “cheapest” about these. It is a very lightweight case. The hinge feels like it’ll break in my pocket if I leave them in there while working or doing any rigorous activity. Battery life is very good. They haven’t died on me while using them throughout the day. The battery in the earbuds themselves will be dead after a night of sleep, but they quickly charge back up in the case. Sound quality - The sound quality of these headphones is just alright. I think they sound decent. The bass is kind of lacking, which I kind of expected since these just kind of hover over your ear canal. You can use the jvc app to tweak the sound profile to add bass, but I didnt notice a big change in bass. Mids and highs are clear and clean. Overall.. They sound good for what it is. They have a clean, crisp sound , “flat” sound profile. Since I only use these in certain situations, I cant complain too much about the sound quality. The point of these headphones, I think. Is to remain aware of your surroundings while listening to music or media. So, heavy bass or mids would make it harder to stay aware of your surroundings. All in all, Im happy with these “nearphones” and I can recommend them if you are looking for something to wear while walking, jogging, bicycling or anything that requires you to stay aware of your surroundings.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the JVC Open-Ear Headphones for over a week now, and I must say that I am impressed. These are rather strange earbuds or over-ear headphones that rest comfortably on the outer rim of your ear while you listen to your music without affecting your being conscious of your surroundings. The open-ear design is really comfortable, even in very extended listening sessions. No ear fatigue or discomfort whatsoever. This is a big plus for those who need to hear the environment, including runners and cyclists. Surprisingly enough, this open-ear design actually has pretty good sound quality. The bass is relatively decent while the mids and highs are clear. Battery life is stellar, normally going several hours with one charge. As for nose isolation, don't expect much from that. These headphones are designed not to block out but let you hear the surroundings around you. They are great for working out, commuting, or just enjoying some tunes without the isolation yourself from the rest of the world."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have a slight addiction to earbuds and headphones but I never contemplated getting this ‘cuff’ style until my wife was talking about them and then of course, getting ad recommendations for them. Pros: Unique Cuff Style Open Style Magnetic hold in case USB-C charging case Lightweight Controls on cuffs App Cons: Not wireless charging Mic quality Can’t see battery status on case Meh: Sound - but expected 100% charged not possible? JVC. Where have you been? I haven’t seen you since my last VCR! OK, enough nostalgia ; right off the bat, these looked cool; unlike any pair of earbuds I own - and I own somewhere in the neighborhood of 7 sets of them - all different types, tech and manufacturers. I was quite excited to jump in & see what they were about. Initial impressions are that these, even in their case, are light as heck. Each earbud seems to have a magnetic pull into the case, keeping them securely in even if the lid of the case is open; not a new method but also not common in every pair. Even lighter than I had anticipated is the case - so light and I have to check a few times just to be sure I still have it. Pushing the cuff onto my ear was easy and there is a pivot spring that flexes allowing it to widen and then go back to cuffing your ear. Pairing was simple and there’s an app to dial-in how you want the sound to be, along with integrating into the notifications of my Phone. While the App may have “bass” mode, these are open earbuds, meaning - quality bass and ANC aren’t possible like they are with in-ear buds. There is a little groove for the speaker that fires the sound into the ear - so cool. I use open-style headphones all day for work, but those are bone conduction. I am not sure I’d be able to work all day with my ears completely covered, so even if I had to go heads-down on something - these buds offer enough immersion and I’d also hear the door knocks. I brought the cuffs to my teenager and the cuff style was dismissed as being weird at first, but once I had them tried on & a favorite song played - the resulting review was, and I quote: “Not gonna like, those are pretty fire.” Not gonna lie … I agree. There isn’t a way to see the current battery level on the case, but using a USB-C cable to charge it will light up the indicator lights showing you charging progress. Another option that would have been great was wireless charging of the case, as my mobile tech ecosystem does take advantage of wireless charging pretty heavily. USB-C is also the standard, so I have plenty of cables - and it did come with a USB-A to C shorty. From walks, to the gym and equally as much while typing this review the sound is great. A feature that isn’t so good - is the mic quality. I used it with Zoom and recorded myself - so I’d hear what others would and it was as if I was in a large room with nothing to deaden the sound - very echoey - so not recommended to be a quality mic for anything other than a quick call - but only because it was convenient. When using the cuffs, there are pretty basic and easy to feel interactions with the button on each cuff. Single, double, triple presses and the like are responsive and tactile. The last little thing for me - is that since the App is tied into the phone for notifications when using them, there are occasional notifications of the battery percentage, per cuff. I can’t say that I’ve ever seen them at 100% and even popping them in to write this review, they came out of the case and said 93 & 94% respectively. I’m hoping for a new firmware to fix this but until then, it’s far from a problem for me. As a person that really enjoys wireless audio devices - from earbuds to Bluetooth and smart speakers, this cuff style earbud is great and I recommend this JVC cuff bud highly!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JVC nearphones clip onto the side of your ear and project sound into it. The advantages of this is that you are still able to hear your surroundings without having to remove our adjust them. I wore them for about an hour before they started to feel a bit uncomfortable, but that's to be expected, however, this will vary by user. I don't tend to wear headphones longer than 2 hours. These nearphones are great for exercising because they stay on well (I tested running, jumping, etc) and really avoid a lot of the sweat that might otherwise accumulate with other types of listening devices. They also worked well for phone calls and picked up my voice without issues. At medium volume, my family members within 3-5 feet away couldn't really hear what i I was listening to because the nearphones do a good job at projecting the sound into the ear. I think these are going to get more popular because they are small, convenient, and very practical, especially with exercising and when you want to listen to your own audio while also having awareness of your surroundings."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC Nearphones are quite unique! They feature a cool and comfortable design that wraps around your ears, providing good support without falling out. They don’t feel tight, and the audio part doesn’t go all the way into your ear, which means you can wear them for several hours without discomfort. However, they are not noise-canceling, so if that’s what you’re looking for, these may not be the right choice. The charging case is well-built and compact, making it easy to store without taking up too much space. Pairing the JVC Nearphones with my devices was simple, and I didn’t encounter any issues at all. On the downside, I found the control buttons to be less responsive than I expected. According to the manual, tapping to operate the earphones was somewhat confusing—sometimes it didn’t respond properly, and it wasn’t easy to skip songs or play and pause the audio. After several attempts, I decided to just use my phone to control the earphones. While that was disappointing, the sound quality is pretty decent. I enjoy the overall sound, which has a nice, soft, laid-back quality. Since the earphones don’t go all the way into your ears, it feels as if you’re truly experiencing the moment. If you are looking for great sound, comfortable earbuds that dont fall out, then these are it!!!!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these earphones. After many years of using many in ear and over the ear ones, I have finally found my match! Let me explain. These little guys go over your ear lobes and clamp around them (very gently) and do not go inside your ear canal. I love this, mainly because I'm someone with over productive ear wax. Most earbuds these days go inside your ear canals and I have to constantly clean them due my condition. Even if you don't have a condition like mine and you hate having something inside your ear canals, these are for you! They came in a small box, inside a carrying case/charger. Took me a while to figure out how to put them on after reading the small booklet inside I figured it out. At first their sound was not that great (being farther away from the ear canal), however once I downloaded their app, everything changed when I selected a boosted audio EQ. If you think at first they are not that great sounding, do that right away, download their app and tweak the audio settings, made a huge difference! Other than that they are very simple to operate like other earbuds, you can press, long press etc. to answer calls, hang up, increase volume, skip music tracks etc., nothing complicated at all. I would say they don't break any sound records in terms of sound quality, but they are great enough, but their greatest strength in my humble opinion is that they don't go inside the ear canals. If you are looking for something comfortable to wear and use like that, these won't disappoint you!!!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The one thing I must say about these headphones, is that you need to give yourself time to adjust to them. My first two days using them I was ready to throw in the towel and say they were the worst headphones I own. However, as I continued to use them for a week, I must say that I have grown to really enjoy and appreciate them. What do I mean by appreciate? Well they do not go in your ear, they hang on your ear like a hoop earring. They are opne air so you can hear all of the ambient noise around you. These have become the headphones I wear when I am hanging out with my family with a movie or sports streaming off my phone in the background. I also use them while I do chores around the house listening to music. I can then remain ""present"" with the family and not miss any of the ongoings or conversations happening at the same time. The reason I did not like them at first was becuase they hurt my ears when I began wearing them. I think I may have tried to get them too close to my ear opening, which is not what you are supposed to do. I felt that they made me sore and I would not be able to use them. However, now that I have the perfect placement for them and I accept that they are not to be snug and tight, I have no issues. The headphones do not get very loud, agian, due to them allowing you to hear ambient noise. If you do need them to go very loud you will raise your volume on your phone almost to the max. However, I do not recommend this and at that point you should just get earbuds or traditional headphones. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is becuase they do not offer wireless charging. At this point I feel that it is almost a requirement for portable earphones such as these. They are also very light and for some reason makes them feel cheap. The battery life is good and the case will get you about two full charges of the headphones with heavy use. Overall, I think that these headphones are going to be my daily around the house headphones. I will also use them when I go shopping and need to be aware of my surroundings. They do in fact fit comfortably on your ear, and connectivity is no issue with them. I would recommend!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The unique open ear cuff design is perfect for me because they are secure, comfortable, allow you to hear things around you, and do not interfere with my glasses (a common issue for me with over the ear type open ear headphones). I regularly wear them while working, because you can wear them in between online meetings and they do not interfere with your ability to have an in-person conversation. The ear cuff is light weight and has a perfectly weighted spring so it is comfortable, but secure enough for a workout (and they are IPX4 water resistant so they should hold up to a little sweat). Pros: 1. Great design and a cool look. In the world of Air pods and their look-a-likes, these stand out and I often get questions/comments on them. 2. Single ear support. Great when you are just using them for meetings and calls. 2. Programmable buttons - there is a real button (not a finicky touch sensor) on each earphone that can be set via the JVC Headphones app to have multiple functions based on the number/length of presses, music or phone call, left/right side, and single or double ear configuration (I kept mine simple, just using them for volume and mute/pause/play). 3. Supports multiple Bluetooth devices connections. This is convenient, because I often swap between my computer and iPhone through out the day. 4. Built-in mics for calls and meetings. 5. Charging case with simple battery level/charging lights and a short USB-C cable. With boost given by the charging case these can easily make it a few days between charges. 6. Simple and useful app (JVC Headphones) for basic equalizer settings, custom button functions, audio quality, battery level, and turning off the blinking status light. Things To Consider: 1. These are great for casual use, but they are not going to wow you with their sound quality or punch - this is really a tradeoff for the open ear design and light weight. Calls are clear and people I spoke with said I was clear on their end, but a few said I did not sound natural - more robotic. When listening to music there is not much bass, and I wish they were a tad louder for noisy environments. The JVC Headphones app has an equalizer, but there are only 3 settings (Normal, Bass, and High); Bass did nothing to help, but High made the music noticeably brighter and louder - it is the best setting.']"

Anything with a little bass just ends these headphones. Like, they vibrate instead of produce that rich low pitch. Its agony to continue to listen. These are worser then flea market headphones. They used to sell these 10$ pair of skullcandy that was decent and could handle the bass. I was away for vacation and left my headphones in the hotel.

One feature I really wish JLab would add to the Work Buds is local mic mute. So that regardless of which application I\'m using for the call (Slack, Teams, Google Meet, Zoom, etc), when I push mute the mic is muted at the ear buds hardware level. This feature should have some audio indicator, like a voice saying ""muted"" or ""un-muted"", so it\'s very clear to the user whether the mic is on or off.', ""I've had these for a little over a week and I'm as satisfied with these new work buds, if not even moreso.

Razer Barracuda X Plus Wireless Gaming Headset for PC/PS5/PS4/Switch - Black,$99.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/razer-barracuda-x-plus-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-black/16206974/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When it comes to Razer headphones, I can't say I've ever been a big fanboy. For a variety of comfort, sound, and sometimes even software support difficulties, I've tried and passed on several wired/wireless incarnations of the Kraken, Nari, and Blackshark. The Barracuda X, on the other hand, came out of nowhere to completely exceed my expectations and deliver some outstanding gaming and multimedia performance on both the PC and Switch, all while resolving some of the comfort issues that plagued some of their past outings. All of this was available without the need for Razer's Synapse client, which can be bloated and resource-intensive at times. To be honest, I didn't think the Barracuda X would be a keeper. But it was a surprise and must keep for gamers , Strongly recommend this headset to all gamers."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset was easy to set up right out of the box. It has a good range, I was able to go downstairs and still connect. It has a long battery life and the sound quality is great for a wireless headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Barracuda X gaming headphones have an incredible sound quality and are extremely comfortable. The foam on the earphones is thick and so comfortable that you forget you are using headphones. These headphones have a wide range of different uses from having the wireless connection ability to also having to separate plug in options! These also are very good at noise cancellation and I cannot hear things outside of the headphones. The only thing I noticed could be improved was the quality of the plastic, the buttons seemed a little cheap but the overall function of the headphones, the sound and the noise cancelling ability was very impressive! I would absolutely recommend these headphones if you’re a gamer or even just work from home and need something comfortable you can wear all day!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always love Razer products so it’s no surprise how much I like these! Everything you need is in the box! Charger, mic, Bluetooth adapter and usb-c adapter, so no need to worry if they will connect to your device! This completely eliminates the issue of having to go back to the store to make your product work which is super annoying. I’m really happy with the sound quality of these headphones as well. The lay nice and flat like, which I think is a great design feature. Additionally, they are metal inside, (I included a pic) so these are very sturdy, and built to last, so you likely won’t need new headphones for a long time! These deserve 10 stars! I noticed their was a review left saying that you can’t see which side the mic works on, but you can! It’s labeled on the mic with a little symbol!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The product is excellent for the gaming as it have low latency. You can play with your friends without any lag. It can work with multiple devices at a time. It is comfortable as it covers your entire ear so if you work for long time it will not give you pain.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Razer Barracuda X is an awesome value for a great quality, comfortable headset. Using with Android, Switch or PS4 is also pretty seamless. I really loved the Barracuda X with my Switch - being able to use them wirelessly is a lot more flexible, and you can always use the included 3.5mm cable to plug them in if you need to charge at the same time. The microphone can be disconnected if you don’t plan on using it but, the sound quality is exceptional. As far as the microphone, people say they can hear me just fine, so i assume it works well too. When playing competitive shooters, I was able to tell what direction gunfire and footsteps were coming from with them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The packaging was amazing and beautiful.The instructions are clear and concise. Overall headphones fit and wear beautifully. The Razer Barracuda X has a unique version of connectivity. It does not use Bluetooth. It uses a USB C dongle that instantly connects. I can switch that between my Galaxy, my PS4, my switch and my PC - just by moving the dongle to the new device. (On the PC I also have to change the sound output in settings). If I want to use it on my iPod I Can use the 3.5mm analog cable in wired mode. The headphones controls are easy to understand and use- for volume and answering calls. The surround sound is excellent, allowing me to get more kills in FPS matches I use my headphones for music listening as well, and enjoy marathon Spotify sessions with excellent clarity and dynamic sound response. The Bass is clear and the highs are solid. The mic is awesome. It only picks me up, which is great. My little sister is always busting in my room trying to say hello to my team or crack a joke about me getting sniped - They cant hear it. They can hear me however- and that makes for better matches and more wins.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] they work great they are just a little heavy to be wearing all day for work', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Audio: Fantastic, especially for gaming competitively, better than my Steel Series Arctis 7 Pro Wireless in that regard, and they are also great everyday listeners as well. App: Has great EQ and features, no bugs. Microphone: excellent considering the price, it has good noise cancellation and does not make your voice sound weird or muffled. It is clear and accurate. Battery life: Absolutely fantastic, I use heavily, around several hours a day or some days, and I don't need to charge usually for several days or even a week+ Build Quality: Plastic is cheap, mine was defective, and I'm returning to razer for refund to purchase one of their aluminum higher priced headsets because I loved this one so much. Be careful with yours."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This headset gives you the best gaming experience. The reason it is one of the best gaming headsets is because you get Bluetooth, wired connected, and wireless connection with a usb from any console, pc, or laptop you’re using. RAZER even has an app to maximize your sound experience as it offers a personal EQ in the app. Overall this is one of if not, the best headset I have ever had, and I plan to buy more of razer’s products in the future.']"

Fast forward 2 months later, and the battery now has a phantom drain issue where I can charge the headphones to full and come back to them a couple of days later and they are dead. I'm really frustrated as Best Buy won't help because it's been over 2 weeks, and Bowers & Wilkins wants me to pay for shipping materials and transit costs in order to send them their defective headphones back.

They both sound fine without motion. But I like the Skullcandy much more because of the cords rubbery feel. The Sony cord is a hard plastic and any movement of the court against your shirt carries into your ear. They both do it somewhat but the Sony was twice as bad. Without any movement they sound is basically identical. I did not test the microphones. BTW the plug on the Skullcandy is straight and the Sony is at a right angle', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had several pairs of these Skullcandy earbuds models varying in price from about $7 to $25 with the same results every time. One side will (or sometimes both sides) eventually stop working. The sound is good enough for me and the controls work okay with my Samusung so I keep getting them over the cheapest earbuds. I just don't count on them to last long and try not be too disappointed when another pair dies."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bought these 3 times, my first pair died within a year, currently on second pair and third was bought as a backup. The audio quality is great, but the bass is a little low. They’re good at noise canceling but that’s mostly because they’re in-ear fit. The weakest link of these earbuds is the toughness. They’re pretty fragile feeling and after heavy use for about 6 months the left earbud stopped working. I’ve decided to buy wireless earbuds for daily use and these as backup’s/legacy non-bluetooth devices I own. Currently my second pair are over a year old and are going strong. Great earbuds for basic use around the house, but not durable enough for activities.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I haven't used these too many times, but so far they are some great earbuds for the price. The sound quality is amazing, as it usually is with Skullcandy. I have a pair of Bose in-ear headphones, and these actually sound a little better, and they are far less expensive. When using these to talk on the phone, the person on the other end says the sound quality of the mic is really good too. The quality of Skullcandy is probably not going to be as good as the high end products as far as how long they last, but if you're looking for amazing sound at a cheap price, these are a great option to look at."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sounds great for the price, dog hasn't gotten to em yet haha"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Brought these as a giftfor my boyfriend. He was due for some new ones since he complained that his other pair hurt his ears. Anyway, I got them at a very good price using my rewards I received. He's not into all the fancy designs or styles so this was perfect for him. He enjoys the sound quality, and since I've not heard anything about his ears hurting they must feel nice and doesn't feel the need to take them off 20mins after using them. So overall I'd say they do the job and if you're looking for some basic earbuds these will serve the purpose."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm very happy with these Jibs! Their performance is almost identical to my ears to the more expensive (now discontinued) Skullcandy Ink'd buds. Their functionality is perfect, and they're cheap! I've finally found my perfect wired earbuds! Pros: -Sound quality -mic quality -Price! Cons: Honestly I have no complaints with these. For the money you cannot get any better, seriously! I cannot count how many crappy/too expensive sets of earbuds I've gone through over the years, its fantastic to finally have good ones that are priced very reasonably."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My nephew asked for some simple earbuds for when he is charging his wireless ones and to take to school. I looked online and these seemed pretty good so I ordered them and they were ready for me to pick up curbside in no time at all (that's a bonus for me). When I gave them to him, he text me right after he tried them out and said that the sound quality on them was amazing and that's high praise from a 16yo boy because I tell you, teenagers are quite picky about these things. So I have to say, this was a score all the way around!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you're hesitant about buying these whether it may be their low price or maybe mixed reviews, just go for it! I have always bought this exact brand of headphones for years and recently got a 3rd pair this month. The price is great and I couldn't see anything wrong if they increased the price. The audio is amazing and feels just like an expensive pair of headphones. The microphone is also great and people have no problem hearing me through it. I hope these never go out of stock so I can continue buying them in the future!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For the price theses are great! I use these as a back up. They are perfect. I got them on sale which was even better. Don't expect high end quality. But they actually sound very good, better than expected. Bass comes through clear. Highs are well balanced. If you're an audio snob, you might hate them. For the rest of us, these will more than do. I have a pair of $50 HyperX earphones although they sound better, these Skullcandy Jib's are way more comfortable. I don't mind the trade off. Great price! Great product!""]"

He loved it, & just like i read on TURTLE BEACH site & here, it plugged right into the Jack on ARMED FORCES & after going into console settings. To adjust volume from tv to headset.

Then I came across these bad boys for $40 and it was game on. Sound is crisp, footsteps and gunshots are easily detectable directionally, they are comfortable and the removable microphone is the cherry on top. Look no further for your headset. P.S. since purchasing these I have had FOUR friends go out on my recommendation to buy the same pair (albeit they all bought white when I got black). They are all thrilled with them still, and it’s been about a month.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a pretty good set of headphones. The fact that they are wired means you will never have to worry about running out of a charge when using them (however, it may drain the battery of your controller faster!). The only gripe I have is that when connecting this to my XBox controller, sometimes the sound doesn't come through. I end up having to disconnect the audio plug and reconnecting it a couple of times. Not a big issue, but still kind of a hassle when I just want to jump into a game quick. But anyhow, it is still a pretty good headset, and at the price I got it for (a fraction of the more expensive headsets), I feel pretty satisfied."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Okay, so I had to get a new headset for my xbox one since my bose qc35 wire broke. I didn't want to spend much as my headphones were already $350. I went and got these for around $40. Quality is okay, but the results are exactly what i wanted. Sound is clear, controls and mic are great. Comfort wise it's also pretty good. I've had them for about 2 months without any issue. The cord is sturdy and overall I am happy. I'd recommend these for those who are price sensitive and want something reliable attached with a low price compared to other similar products. I do a lot of research before buying products and this one was the most reasonable for me."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought these for my 14 year old because the one that came with his X-box One died.

Since they cover both ears, now he can't hear me when I am calling him, talking to him . . . makes it easy for him to tune out the phone ringing and other voices too well . . . like mine. If you have a teen, they will love them simply for that reason alone. I have to say, it does make it kind of fun for casually walking up behind him, scaring him and making him jump though.

I never really wanted to pay more for a headset but this one was on sale for the same price as the standard XBOX headset so I thought I'd give it a go. Initially I didn't like it but that was because I was unfamiliar with the settings.

I was fortunate enough to receive mine early (and a flawless pair of buds, I inspected them closely and even pulled my tips off with no tears or issues) before the quality control concerns caused a halt in production. I am absolutely delighted with these earbuds! They stay in my ears securely, which is a significant improvement. The new design also creates an excellent seal, enhancing the effectiveness of the active noise cancellation (ANC). The ANC feature is remarkable, by the way! The sound quality is just as impressive as the Buds 2 Pro, if not better. There is definitely more bass compared to the previous Buds 2 Pro. The new touch and pinch controls function exceptionally well, and I have not experienced any frustrations with them. I highly recommend these earbuds.', ""Very good sound, but the ANC is not that good! Also the battery doesn't last as expected. The earbud insert is not that comfortable and the fit is not as good as it should. The sound is pretty good but there's more CONs that PROs. The Case its pretty and that's about it. I choose to get the white ones because the seams are not as obvious like the silver ones. It came with a case but, if you need to pair to another device you will need to remove from the case because they didn't think all the way through. The button to pair is no accessible with the case on. Like I mentioned the fit is not the best and the rubber inserts are kind of hard so is not that comfortable and doesn't seal the ear canal the way it should. That's also why the ANC is not as good like the previous version (2pro). I will be afraid of exercise with them and lose them."", 'Man, these Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are absolute beasts! The sound quality? Insane. Crystal clear with deep, punchy bass that hits just right. The features are top-tier—voice controls are on point, the connection is fast and seamless, and the touch buttons are super responsive and easy to use. Now, let’s talk battery life—I put them in at 7 AM, and one bud lasted all the way until 2:30 PM, and that’s while taking calls, watching series, and scrolling through social media. That’s some serious endurance! If you’re looking for high-quality, feature-packed earbuds, these are it. I’ve already recommended them to everyone I know, and honestly, I’d do it again. Samsung killed it with these! 💯', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They have a decent sound, they have a good selections of features that are practical. I wanted to keep them because i bought the Samsung galaxy S25 ultra, Galaxy watch ultra and Book5 pro. But they never worked as inwas expecting. One earbud keep disconnecting from the Book5 and sometimes they were connected but there was not sound coming out. My big complaint is that I could not get them to stay in my ear. They keep falling down. I could not pass the fit test with none of the rubber tips. I order second ones to see if there was something wrong with my first ones. So I could never use it as I was afraid of losing them. I ending returning then and buy a Bose earbuds Quietcomfort Ultra, better sound and stay in my ears. The idea was good but performance not great. I will try the next generation. If you do not pay the full price go for them if they stay in your ears.', 'Better than the previous ones, Galaxy Buds Pro 3 offer excellent sound quality, very good noise cancellation and a very comfortable fit. They have a perfect integration with Samsung devices and its ecosystem, they have an improved battery life and intuitive touch controls, they are an excellent option for premium wireless headphones. Their construction is premium from every angle. Highly recommended.', 'Love my earbuds. I like that I can ""pinch"" to hang up calls. Few earbuds are responsive like Samsung\'s.

Please revisit your packaging. You have great goals!', ""I bought a pair of these headphones in 2014. I have used them for around 3-4 hours minimum each day at least 6 days a week every week since I bought them. They have just broken and that's only really because I dropped them in front of my house and my dad managed to reverse over the head. They're not completely tangle free but they are so easy to untangle I got apple earphones for the first time in 5 years and now I understand why they invented Airpods because they couldn't steal Marley's cord idea. I'm pretty clumsy and reckless and the past week without them has made me feel genuinely lost. Love them, Love them. Love them. Just ordered a new pair."", 'I used to have to buy a new pair of headphones every month, basically. They always seemed to break on me even if I invested (insert sum of money here). I bought these headphones about five years ago now, back in high school. I’ve slept with them in, exercised in them, tossed them in my bag, in the washer.... I’ve completely tortured these headphones. They still work as good as the day that I bought them. It dawned on me truly how long I’ve had them and I went online to see if they still sell them. I’m relieved. I will be buying more, whenever these decide to pass away. Sadly, they don’t sell the color I have anymore. Hopefully, they get more variants.', ""I was very pleased with the frequency response of these earbuds. They pick up middle tones fine and give a full-sounding bass, at least in my opinion. Experience has shown me that wood-based earbuds of various makes can fail early, so I recommend ordering them at the customer service counter in-store, and getting the replacement plan. My first pair of these lasted two months; the second (acquired through Best Buy's product replacement program) lasted two years, and died only because of an unfortunate accident. I will be ordering a new pair, in store, of the same because I am pleased with the balance between price and performance."", 'I bought these headphones three years ago and am blown away by the quality and comfort of these headphones.The tangle-free cord is high quality and has lasted longer than any other pair i have owned. They are functional and sustainable, while keeping it classy and hip. ALSO, not five minutes ago, I accidentally dropped one of the headphones in my mug of hot water, as I left my desk to grab something from storage. Much to my sleep-deprived horror, I only noticed when I returned. After quickly drying and separating the components, I tried them out and they STILL WORKED! 10/10 would recommend to anyone like me with a bad track record with headphones.', 'Marley earbuds are my go to. I like the way they sound and I like the covered cord. I feel like these earbuds last longer than other earbuds in this price range. The previous pair I had worked great for well over a year of daily use and didn’t finally give out until after I accidentally washed them. Having said that, I didn’t realize when I ordered this pair that they have the little attached microphone/button. In my experience that bit always breaks first on a pair of earbuds so if I had known I would have opted for a pair without that feature. But who knows, maybe the Marley’s will be different and that bit won’t break. Anyways they’re working great so far.', 'ive bought two pairs of these bad boys, and let me tell you man the price for these made me worry + but, my worries have turned to mist a year later. these things are near invincible, they last for ages granted you take basic care of them. and for the price they sound near top tear, no awful buzzing, no stupid levels of bass, theyre very solid for everyday use. - the only downsides are the type of lacing thats used to wrap the wire. it can get loose and cause the wire to twist and turn without the ability to just unplug them and untangle them, as they sometimes just stay twisted. otherwise ballin product and id defo get another pair for myself and the wife', ""I brought these about a month or two ago and only recently I started to notice something wrong with the earbuds. every so often there will be some kind of buzz that pops during a song. this is strange as I haven't had these for very long and still are relatively new. also, the so-called tangle-free earbud cable does get tangled quite a bit, but what cable doesn't. the one thing I LOVE about these earbuds is that they really do block out all noise and they are very stylish and trendy. I wouldn't know for sure if my pair is just faulty or its a problem everywhere. either they are good earbuds. KEEP IT UP HOUSE OF MARLEY!"", 'These are my headphone of choice and they have great sound quality. I am very rough on my headphones I use them most of the day everyday and they are constantly get crammed into my pockets, caught on things, stepped on, driven over by golf carts, lost, left outside overnight, thrown through the wash, etc.(at no fault to the headphones obviously). These headphones are just as comfortable as they are stylish, people love the unique look of the braided chord and wood. These usually last me about a year where as most headphones only last a month. Will continue to purchase and recommend these fro the foreseeable future.', ""The sound quality is pretty good, I like it and it's great for the price but the buds won't stay in my ears. The product only comes with one earbud size but luckily i have some rubber things that came with my old earphones that were the right size to fit on these because they help them stay in my ears. They are not tangle resistant as advertised and the 'copper' ones came with a pink string not white and grey like the picture. Overall I like them for the sound and the fact that they're eco-friendly but there is some misrepresentation in the photos and description and they fall out of my ears very easily.""]"
Turtle Beach Stealth 500 Wireless Gaming Headset - Black,$89.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/turtle-beach-stealth-500-wireless-gaming-headset-black/17933293/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are light weight and in my opinion a great starter headset. They are wireless and Bluetooth so they can work with other devices. They do not have much bass but are very clear and block out outside noise very well naturally. They are not for people with big heads straight out of the box but the elastic strap is adjustable to accommodate. Make sure that you charge these fully and download the software so you can update them or the Bluetooth will not work. You will need to first download the software then plug the dongle in turn on the headset and then choose update in the software do not disconnect. After that they work flawless. They will work with the dongle right out of the box tho. These are a lower end set but a great value for your money get you some Fortnite or call of duty wins no-one can sneak around you now! These are a great price for the quality!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far the battery life is fantastic, 40 hours. The sound is great but quiet, you have to turn up the volume. The microphone is kind of quiet too. Could be updated or be better with software updates.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My husband really liked this wireless gaming headset. At the bottom of the headset there is a button to switch between 2.4 GHz wireless connections and Bluetooth. They feel light on the head and do not put pressure on the head at all; memory foam ear pads contribute to good noise insulation. The charge holds for quite a long time, about 2 days of continuous operation or 3-4 days. There is software that can be installed for computers and for iOS and Android to adjust equalizer settings, activate microphone monitoring and much more. These headphones have an ultra-clear microphone and the ability to mute the sound. Using the button at the bottom of the headset you can adjust the sound, for example, boost the bass. The headphones look durable.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easily the best headset I've owned in years! All my previous ones, while decent, never really lived up to my expectations of a good headset. Either one had too much bass, one too much treble, another didn't have any sort of spacial sound or sounded sort of muffled, then the comfort of a few were just painful after barely 20 min of use. So finally, after well over 10 years, I finally got a turtle beach headset again and boy do I wish I did so sooner. To start, the comfort level of this headset is phenomenal. I dont get headaches from the weight or pressure on the top of my head and the soft padding around the ears coupled with the larger opening keeps my ears from hurting and feeling squished. The buttons and sliders on the side of the headset are easy to reach and give a small audio alert when at or near max volume. As for the sound quality, my god. There is a perfect balance between the highs, lows and mids, the bass is not so strong it hurts but not so weak it might as well not be there, the ability to hear the most softest of footsteps approaching you will give you an incredible edge in online games. I think I'm most impressed with how much sound I've been missing out on. Gunshots and explosions now pack a realistic punch I'm often finding myself in awe at the cripsness I'm able to hear everything. It is an absolute game changer and I cannot recommend this headset enough. The app, however, is only useful for updates. It is so buggy and useless at the time of me writing this that I feel like it's in it's alpha stage of testing because it just does not work. It'll be nice when that works so I can potentially see how much battery is remaining."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently received the Turtle Beach Stealth 500 Wireless Amplified Gaming Headset in exchange for my honest feedback, and after several weeks of testing, I'm excited to share my experience with this versatile headset. First Impressions and Setup: Upon unboxing, the Stealth 500 immediately impressed me with its sleek design and lightweight build. The leatherette-wrapped memory foam ear cushions feel incredibly soft and comfortable, making long gaming sessions a breeze. The floating headband design ensures a perfect fit without any pressure points, which is a game-changer for extended use. Performance and Features: The headset offers dual connectivity options with low-latency 2.4GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.2. Switching between these modes is seamless thanks to the QuickSwitch button on the headset. While pairing with my PC and PS5 was straightforward, I encountered some difficulty pairing it with my mobile phone. It required downloading the Swarm II mobile app to complete the process. Once the app was installed, pairing was straightforward, and the added functionality of adjusting EQ settings and other audio features through the app was a nice bonus. Audio Quality: The Stealth 500’s 40mm drivers deliver exceptional sound quality. The audio is clear and precise, with well-balanced highs and lows. The headset is optimized for spatial audio, enhancing my gaming experience by providing immersive soundscapes. The noise-canceling feature of the ear cushions effectively blocks out background noise, allowing me to focus entirely on my game. Battery Life: One of the standout features is the impressive battery life. With up to 40 hours on a single charge, I rarely worry about running out of battery mid-game. The quick charge feature is also incredibly convenient, allowing me to get back into the game quickly after a short charging session. Microphone: The flip-to-mute omni-directional microphone provides clear and accurate voice communication. The ability to adjust mic monitoring levels through the Swarm II app is particularly useful, as it helps me avoid shouting by hearing my own voice in the headset. Final Thoughts: Despite the initial hiccup with mobile pairing, the Turtle Beach Stealth 500 has proven to be an outstanding wireless gaming headset. Its combination of comfort, audio quality, and battery life makes it a fantastic choice for gamers across various platforms. The additional customization options via the Swarm II app enhance the overall experience, allowing for fine-tuning to personal preferences. I highly recommend the Stealth 500 to anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich gaming headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the best headsets out on the market for the price!

The audio quality is outstanding, delivering crisp, immersive sound that's perfect for intense gaming sessions. The microphone performance is equally impressive, providing clear communication with teammates. The headset's build is solid and durable, contributing to its overall premium feel. However, the sturdy construction also means it's a bit heavy, which can lead to some discomfort during extended use. If it were slightly lighter, I would definitely rate it a 5. Despite this, the comfort and functionality it offers still make it a fantastic choice for any serious gamer.""]"

As someone who wears AirPods for 9+ hours a day at work and working out my ears get sore from wearing them for so long. These headphones don’t go directly in the ear which is nice and comfortable they also don’t move at all with the wrap around ear holders. I’ve put these headphones to the test the past few weeks and I am very pleased with them and will continue to use them as my everyday pair of headphones!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After wearing my Belkin SoundForm Breeze Wireless Earbuds I can honestly say they are superior to my old pair! Connectivity to two devices was automatic and the extended battery life is perfect (8 hours in use plus 18 hours charging with the case!!). I’ve worn them while gardening and even with constant bending they staying securely in my ears (testament to quality ear design and comfort), bike riding is enjoyable while listening to the newest bestseller on my SoundForm earbuds, even mowing didn’t impact the superior sound quality! Additionally, phone conversations have clear sound on both ends (I asked 😃). You can’t go wrong with the Belkin SoundForm Breeze earbuds!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These have great sound quality. It’s clear and precise. They connect easy and quickly with little to no problems or difficulties. The in ear design takes some getting used to. It sits on the outside of your ear and doesn’t feel super secure. Even though I have yet to have them fall out of my ear while wearing them, they don’t feel super safe and tight while you have them in. Be aware that they will feel loose. That’s just part of their design. I find myself adjusting them a lot for that reason and because of that, I end up pressing the button easily often because it’s very sensitive. Overall, once you get used to them, I think they are worth it. It is different than what you’re used to but I recommend for people who don’t like earbuds or haven’t found ones that are comfortable for them. Also great for joggers or people who need to still hear their background surroundings because these are great for that.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Belkin open ear headphones are amazing!

Bose QuietComfort In-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds - Black,$229.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-in-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-earbuds-black/18388123/review,"['When I returned full time back to the office for work I found it difficult to hold conference calls in my cubicle with all the back ground noise. My Bose quiet comfort headphones are noise canceling, but I needed a boost so in May 2024 I purchased the Bose quit comfort ulta earbuds. I love them they cancel out all background noise and fit good. I only found one problem… battery life. I found myself relying so much on them at work I needed another pair. When I saw the new design and affordable price point I was sold. Had to have them and I’m glad I did!!! I absolutely love the new Bose quit comfort earbuds. They are not my back up pair they are actually my main pair and the comfort ulta earbuds are my back up pair. I can’t get over how comfortable the new quit comfort earbuds are. I wear them the full charge of 8.5 hours a day. The fit makes the sound quality and noise canceling amazing. The case is well done with 2.5 in extra charges. From voice control or tap control these buds are so user friendly. If one happens to fall out the sound immediately stops alerting you.Don’t get me wrong that’s earbuds are great for the office, but they are definitely not all about business!! Music sounds the most amazing coming through these earbuds. The bass and sound quality can’t be beat. The case is wire or wireless charging capacities. I really have nothing negative to say at this price point and Bose is a name you can trust.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using these for just over the last week. During that time I feel they’ve been given a very fair trial. I’ve used them on a long train journey, a recent inpatient day case at the hospital and mainly whilst working from home. I’ve owned quite a few pairs of Bose headphones over the years, from over ear, on ear and buds. I prefer to pay extra for decent sound so I can enjoy the experience of listening to music.. not just enjoy the music. To start with, I believe these are a great entry level pair of Bose earbuds. They give good sound, easy pairing, great battery and very good noise cancellation. The style of case is a different shape to my other Bose earbuds and although not a bad design / shape I felt they didn’t have the same kind of texture / premium feel as others have had. Although the pricing does reflect some of these changes. When the case is closed I do feel the case is durable and if dropped the magnet is strong enough to remain closed and protect your earbuds. They come with customisable rubber buds to make sure they fit perfectly into your ear. Once in, they fit extremely well and no amount of head shaking or running knock them out. They are comfortable and snug. They connect extremely quickly to my iPhone and iPad and when answering calls it’s a seamless process from music to call. They offer 3 options of noise cancelling, quiet, aware and off. This isn’t as many or as customisable as other Bose earbud options but these are still very good options. The noise cancelling is truly fantastic that you wouldn’t get from any other brand except Bose. They kept out all train commuter noises. They also managed to keep out all hospital beeping and bustling around. When the app is downloaded you have the option of adding extra bass etc if you feel the sound is a little flat. Overall for the price these are a fantastic pair of Bose earbuds. Undoubtedly Bose do offer more premium versions of these but these offer comfort in ear, secure fit, great sound and superb noise reduction.', 'Although these share the same name as the original Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the 2nd generation brings some notable upgrades. First off, the case design stands out—it’s smaller but slightly thicker than my QuietComfort 2 case due to the removal of the earbud stems. The new matte finish on the case is sleek, and a much-appreciated upgrade is the wireless charging feature, which wasn’t available on the previous model. A key change is the introduction of a dedicated app, Bose QC Earbuds, with a unique ""B"" and ""BCE"" logo. This app gives you full control over your earbud experience, offering features like: Noise Control: You can switch between Quiet, Aware, or Off modes either in the app or by voice commands. In general, noise cancellation is excellent, though I did notice that in Quiet mode, wind noise during outdoor walks seemed more pronounced. This may be because the Quiet mode reduces other sounds, making wind noise stand out more—I\'ll need to test it further. EQ Settings: The default EQ is set to Flat, but there are presets like Bass Boost, Treble Boost, and Custom, allowing you to fine-tune Low, Mid, and High frequencies to your liking. Touch Controls: You can customize Single, Double, and Triple Press, as well as Hold functions for each earbud, giving you complete control over your listening experience. Voice Control: Available in multiple languages (English, Chinese, German, French, and Spanish), you activate commands by saying ""Hey Headphones."" I had a few issues getting this to work reliably, but it might just be a learning curve. One of the standout features is Multipoint connectivity, which lets you seamlessly connect to two devices at once. Switching between my phone and computer was a breeze, which is incredibly convenient. Other useful features include Fast Mute with touch control, a remote selfie option to control your phone’s camera, and Smart Calls, allowing you to accept or reject calls, use low-latency mode for gaming or movies, and even check battery predictions for how much playtime or talk time you have left. The noise cancellation is top-notch, as expected from Bose. It’s also IPX4 water-resistant, meaning it can handle splashes and light rain—great for daily walks. The earbuds come with three sizes of silicone ear tips and stability bands to ensure a perfect fit. Battery life is solid—8.5 hours on the earbuds alone, or up to 31 hours with the charging case. Fast charging gives you 2 hours of playback with just a 20-minute charge. Overall, these 2nd-gen QuietComfort Earbuds deliver an impressive upgrade with features that rival or surpass other top brands, all while maintaining Bose’s legendary sound quality and noise cancellation. At an affordable price, these everyday earbuds are ideal for anyone, including retirees like me, who enjoy listening to music during daily walks without breaking the bank. Bose nailed it with these—Powerful, not precious, just as they promised.', 'I have struggled to find buds that fit my tiny ears without pain after an hour. I had some custom fit that were great but I could only wear them for a couple of hours. When they say ""noise canceling"" they aren\'t joking. No cap. I bought them for work because my old Bose speaker is too loud in my baking space. Unfortunately I can\'t use them at work because I can\'t hear my timers going off. They are LOUD to be heard over the music from the bakers on the other side of my ovens. Long story short - these are extremely comfortable, have great sound and just noise canceling enough to know the fire alarm is going off but still hear whatever you are listening to.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose QCE set a new standard with their exceptional noise-canceling ability, effortlessly blocking out even the most persistent background noise. The long battery life means you can enjoy uninterrupted playback throughout your day without constantly needing a charge. Designed for comfort, they fit securely and don’t budge, even during intense activity. What’s more, their significantly smaller size compared to the predecessor makes them lightweight and discreet without sacrificing sound quality. With this perfect balance of comfort, performance, and convenience, these earbuds are a top choice for any audio enthusiast.', 'The earbuds and the QCE app are pretty amazing! I was easily able to switch the noise canceling from on to off and to their third option, which is called “Awareness”. I was also able to switch between devices very smoothly and it has the option to connect to two different devices simultaneously. You can adjust the touch and voice settings easily, as well as equalizing the base and treble. Would recommend for any music lover and multiple device user.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] In regards to the Bose headphones, I found my experience rather superb. The design provides a comfortable and sturdy earpiece that won’t fall out the ear. Along with the design, the color adds that pop of unique and personal touch.', 'So I have had these earbud about a month now and they are amazing. I use to have Apple AirPods and I won’t be going back. The comfort, the light weight, the features, not feeling like the ear buds will slide out when I’m working out, and noise canceling. I like the aware mode and noise canceling mode that the earbud has. I can wear 1 earbud or both, still talk and have a conversation with someone not having to take the earbuds out and in order to block out background noise I don’t have to turn the volume up all the way saving both my hearing and the battery life. The sound is crisp sound while listening to music or gives you the movie theater feel while streaming movies. Bose made an outstanding product with these earbuds.', 'What a great product! I have owned multiple Bose Earbuds, including the QuietComfort Earbuds II and QuietComfort Ultra. The new QuietComfort Earbuds (2nd Gen) are just fantastic. This might sound odd, but they feel so light on the ears that I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Bose products always have the best sound, but I am truly impressed with the audio quality of this product. I love that it comes with an adjustable EQ on the QCE app. I listen to a lot of music, but I have also been using these earbuds to listen to podcasts and watch live TV on my phone. They are incredibly easy to connect and use. I am pleased that they come with voice commands, and I am looking forward to testing this feature more in the next few days. Additionally, these earbuds are water and sweat resistant, making them perfect for my workouts. Although I miss the Immersion feature, the Quiet and Aware modes work flawlessly. The Quiet mode is especially effective in my chatty workroom of about 40 colleagues. I often keep the earbuds on even when I’m not listening to anything, just for the noise-canceling feature, and they do not bother me at all. I use different-sized ear tips for each ear, and they fit well on my oddly-sized ears. The battery life is relentless; it just lasts forever. I think I have only charged them twice so far because of how long the battery lasts. These earbuds, at their given price point, are perfect for everyday use but still pack the punch of high-quality earbuds in terms of sound, performance, noise cancellation, and comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a long time wearer of over ear noise cancellation headphones and always thought the noise cancelling of ear buds would never match. I was wrong. These ear buds have amazing noise cancelling abilities, just as good as the over head ones. The feature to go from quiet, aware to noise cancelling off was also very good and easy to use. The sound quality, again, was faultless. The sound quality of phone calls when outside/ in noisy environments is very good. Had no issues with any calls I made. The ability to customise the ‘touches’ to specific actions you want in the Bose App was also very good and a great idea. The accompanying app itself is good - easy to use and great way to configure your buds. I can also say they are very durable - I managed to drop the case several times (on wood and vinyl floors) and the case never split open, broke or had a scratch on it. The earbuds are the same- I feel confident that if one accidentally fell- they wouldn’t break. Comfort- their size to me is no issue, they are on the bulkier side. The sizing/ variety of their changeable buds could use improvement. I think offering smaller sizes would be beneficial. I use the smallest size on offer and could do with an even smaller size for the best fit. Despite this, they are not uncomfortable. The battery life is exceptional! Barely needed charging compared to my other devices. I would definitely recommend these to friends and family, and would definitely purchase these again in future. They are expensive, but for the noise cancellation quality- they are worth every penny.']"

Bose QuietComfort In-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds - Chilled Lilac,$229.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-in-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-earbuds-chilled-lilac/18388125/review,"['When I returned full time back to the office for work I found it difficult to hold conference calls in my cubicle with all the back ground noise. My Bose quiet comfort headphones are noise canceling, but I needed a boost so in May 2024 I purchased the Bose quit comfort ulta earbuds. I love them they cancel out all background noise and fit good. I only found one problem… battery life. I found myself relying so much on them at work I needed another pair. When I saw the new design and affordable price point I was sold. Had to have them and I’m glad I did!!! I absolutely love the new Bose quit comfort earbuds. They are not my back up pair they are actually my main pair and the comfort ulta earbuds are my back up pair. I can’t get over how comfortable the new quit comfort earbuds are. I wear them the full charge of 8.5 hours a day. The fit makes the sound quality and noise canceling amazing. The case is well done with 2.5 in extra charges. From voice control or tap control these buds are so user friendly. If one happens to fall out the sound immediately stops alerting you.Don’t get me wrong that’s earbuds are great for the office, but they are definitely not all about business!! Music sounds the most amazing coming through these earbuds. The bass and sound quality can’t be beat. The case is wire or wireless charging capacities. I really have nothing negative to say at this price point and Bose is a name you can trust.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using these for just over the last week. During that time I feel they’ve been given a very fair trial. I’ve used them on a long train journey, a recent inpatient day case at the hospital and mainly whilst working from home. I’ve owned quite a few pairs of Bose headphones over the years, from over ear, on ear and buds. I prefer to pay extra for decent sound so I can enjoy the experience of listening to music.. not just enjoy the music. To start with, I believe these are a great entry level pair of Bose earbuds. They give good sound, easy pairing, great battery and very good noise cancellation. The style of case is a different shape to my other Bose earbuds and although not a bad design / shape I felt they didn’t have the same kind of texture / premium feel as others have had. Although the pricing does reflect some of these changes. When the case is closed I do feel the case is durable and if dropped the magnet is strong enough to remain closed and protect your earbuds. They come with customisable rubber buds to make sure they fit perfectly into your ear. Once in, they fit extremely well and no amount of head shaking or running knock them out. They are comfortable and snug. They connect extremely quickly to my iPhone and iPad and when answering calls it’s a seamless process from music to call. They offer 3 options of noise cancelling, quiet, aware and off. This isn’t as many or as customisable as other Bose earbud options but these are still very good options. The noise cancelling is truly fantastic that you wouldn’t get from any other brand except Bose. They kept out all train commuter noises. They also managed to keep out all hospital beeping and bustling around. When the app is downloaded you have the option of adding extra bass etc if you feel the sound is a little flat. Overall for the price these are a fantastic pair of Bose earbuds. Undoubtedly Bose do offer more premium versions of these but these offer comfort in ear, secure fit, great sound and superb noise reduction.', 'Although these share the same name as the original Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the 2nd generation brings some notable upgrades. First off, the case design stands out—it’s smaller but slightly thicker than my QuietComfort 2 case due to the removal of the earbud stems. The new matte finish on the case is sleek, and a much-appreciated upgrade is the wireless charging feature, which wasn’t available on the previous model. A key change is the introduction of a dedicated app, Bose QC Earbuds, with a unique ""B"" and ""BCE"" logo. This app gives you full control over your earbud experience, offering features like: Noise Control: You can switch between Quiet, Aware, or Off modes either in the app or by voice commands. In general, noise cancellation is excellent, though I did notice that in Quiet mode, wind noise during outdoor walks seemed more pronounced. This may be because the Quiet mode reduces other sounds, making wind noise stand out more—I\'ll need to test it further. EQ Settings: The default EQ is set to Flat, but there are presets like Bass Boost, Treble Boost, and Custom, allowing you to fine-tune Low, Mid, and High frequencies to your liking. Touch Controls: You can customize Single, Double, and Triple Press, as well as Hold functions for each earbud, giving you complete control over your listening experience. Voice Control: Available in multiple languages (English, Chinese, German, French, and Spanish), you activate commands by saying ""Hey Headphones."" I had a few issues getting this to work reliably, but it might just be a learning curve. One of the standout features is Multipoint connectivity, which lets you seamlessly connect to two devices at once. Switching between my phone and computer was a breeze, which is incredibly convenient. Other useful features include Fast Mute with touch control, a remote selfie option to control your phone’s camera, and Smart Calls, allowing you to accept or reject calls, use low-latency mode for gaming or movies, and even check battery predictions for how much playtime or talk time you have left. The noise cancellation is top-notch, as expected from Bose. It’s also IPX4 water-resistant, meaning it can handle splashes and light rain—great for daily walks. The earbuds come with three sizes of silicone ear tips and stability bands to ensure a perfect fit. Battery life is solid—8.5 hours on the earbuds alone, or up to 31 hours with the charging case. Fast charging gives you 2 hours of playback with just a 20-minute charge. Overall, these 2nd-gen QuietComfort Earbuds deliver an impressive upgrade with features that rival or surpass other top brands, all while maintaining Bose’s legendary sound quality and noise cancellation. At an affordable price, these everyday earbuds are ideal for anyone, including retirees like me, who enjoy listening to music during daily walks without breaking the bank. Bose nailed it with these—Powerful, not precious, just as they promised.', 'I have struggled to find buds that fit my tiny ears without pain after an hour. I had some custom fit that were great but I could only wear them for a couple of hours. When they say ""noise canceling"" they aren\'t joking. No cap. I bought them for work because my old Bose speaker is too loud in my baking space. Unfortunately I can\'t use them at work because I can\'t hear my timers going off. They are LOUD to be heard over the music from the bakers on the other side of my ovens. Long story short - these are extremely comfortable, have great sound and just noise canceling enough to know the fire alarm is going off but still hear whatever you are listening to.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose QCE set a new standard with their exceptional noise-canceling ability, effortlessly blocking out even the most persistent background noise. The long battery life means you can enjoy uninterrupted playback throughout your day without constantly needing a charge. Designed for comfort, they fit securely and don’t budge, even during intense activity. What’s more, their significantly smaller size compared to the predecessor makes them lightweight and discreet without sacrificing sound quality. With this perfect balance of comfort, performance, and convenience, these earbuds are a top choice for any audio enthusiast.', 'The earbuds and the QCE app are pretty amazing! I was easily able to switch the noise canceling from on to off and to their third option, which is called “Awareness”. I was also able to switch between devices very smoothly and it has the option to connect to two different devices simultaneously. You can adjust the touch and voice settings easily, as well as equalizing the base and treble. Would recommend for any music lover and multiple device user.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] In regards to the Bose headphones, I found my experience rather superb. The design provides a comfortable and sturdy earpiece that won’t fall out the ear. Along with the design, the color adds that pop of unique and personal touch.', 'So I have had these earbud about a month now and they are amazing. I use to have Apple AirPods and I won’t be going back. The comfort, the light weight, the features, not feeling like the ear buds will slide out when I’m working out, and noise canceling. I like the aware mode and noise canceling mode that the earbud has. I can wear 1 earbud or both, still talk and have a conversation with someone not having to take the earbuds out and in order to block out background noise I don’t have to turn the volume up all the way saving both my hearing and the battery life. The sound is crisp sound while listening to music or gives you the movie theater feel while streaming movies. Bose made an outstanding product with these earbuds.', 'What a great product! I have owned multiple Bose Earbuds, including the QuietComfort Earbuds II and QuietComfort Ultra. The new QuietComfort Earbuds (2nd Gen) are just fantastic. This might sound odd, but they feel so light on the ears that I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Bose products always have the best sound, but I am truly impressed with the audio quality of this product. I love that it comes with an adjustable EQ on the QCE app. I listen to a lot of music, but I have also been using these earbuds to listen to podcasts and watch live TV on my phone. They are incredibly easy to connect and use. I am pleased that they come with voice commands, and I am looking forward to testing this feature more in the next few days. Additionally, these earbuds are water and sweat resistant, making them perfect for my workouts. Although I miss the Immersion feature, the Quiet and Aware modes work flawlessly. The Quiet mode is especially effective in my chatty workroom of about 40 colleagues. I often keep the earbuds on even when I’m not listening to anything, just for the noise-canceling feature, and they do not bother me at all. I use different-sized ear tips for each ear, and they fit well on my oddly-sized ears. The battery life is relentless; it just lasts forever. I think I have only charged them twice so far because of how long the battery lasts. These earbuds, at their given price point, are perfect for everyday use but still pack the punch of high-quality earbuds in terms of sound, performance, noise cancellation, and comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a long time wearer of over ear noise cancellation headphones and always thought the noise cancelling of ear buds would never match. I was wrong. These ear buds have amazing noise cancelling abilities, just as good as the over head ones. The feature to go from quiet, aware to noise cancelling off was also very good and easy to use. The sound quality, again, was faultless. The sound quality of phone calls when outside/ in noisy environments is very good. Had no issues with any calls I made. The ability to customise the ‘touches’ to specific actions you want in the Bose App was also very good and a great idea. The accompanying app itself is good - easy to use and great way to configure your buds. I can also say they are very durable - I managed to drop the case several times (on wood and vinyl floors) and the case never split open, broke or had a scratch on it. The earbuds are the same- I feel confident that if one accidentally fell- they wouldn’t break. Comfort- their size to me is no issue, they are on the bulkier side. The sizing/ variety of their changeable buds could use improvement. I think offering smaller sizes would be beneficial. I use the smallest size on offer and could do with an even smaller size for the best fit. Despite this, they are not uncomfortable. The battery life is exceptional! Barely needed charging compared to my other devices. I would definitely recommend these to friends and family, and would definitely purchase these again in future. They are expensive, but for the noise cancellation quality- they are worth every penny.']"

Check out JLab's Bluetooth Air Pro. No wires just great sound. All the features you expect from a set of earbuds. Easy to pair and reliable at 20 to 30 feet from your Bluetooth device. Simple taps to control most frequent functions. Mine charge in an hour or two. USB plug built into the hard shelled carrying case which has a built in battery that can recharge your earbuds three extra times. All day use. Place them in the case for a boost extending use for 30 some hours. Great all weekend. The soft cushioned buds fit comfortably in my ear. Yet I can sense sounds and conversations around me. That gives me peace of mind when I am in public, yet don't want to disturb anyone with my audio. The USB case cord won't get misplaced or forgotten since it stores neatly into the bottom of the case. Small yet clear sound. Decent microphone, so I've been told. Two device compatibility means I can answer the phone while using (working) on my laptop. It knows when I remove the earpiece from my ears and play pauses. Saves the battery too."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I think this is my ninth set of BT wireless earbuds. Only because they keep getting better. This is my 4 pair of JLabs, and each pair improves over the previous, in one or more ways. Jlabs positions themselves as a value brand, but boy their sound quality keeps improving. Jlabs claims each earbud will last +9h in a charge and the case can charge them 3 times giving a total of 36h battery life (9h+27h from charging case). I fully charged, and updated my firmware before trying them out. I had no problem pairing them with my iPhone 12 pro. I then ran them through JLabs burn in tool overnight (looks like they lasted ~8h 40m), just short of the 9h quoted lifespan, and then I recharged them. I already had the JLabs Sound app installed and my Air Pro Earbuds were immediately recognized, and my battery level showed 100% on each earbud. The software provides a 10 band equalizer, which is awesome. They have 3 predefined curves (Signature, Balanced and Base Boost that are good starting points to defined and save your own presets. You can easily move between defined curves to compare the variances. The Signature was the closest to my preference. Now on to the important part, how do they sound and fit. I generally move to the next larger rubber earbud surround, but after testing I found the standard set worked just fine for me. JLab used to provide a blue foam spongy tip, it seems they no longer do. I had a pair from what I had previously, they they fit fine in the Air Pro\'s; I prefer them for longer listening, but the silicon that came with them were fine, they didn\'t feel loose and the sound seal seemed good. These earbuds are slightly smaller and lighter (with longer battery life) than the prior generation. Now on to music, I started with Traffic\'s Live (On The Road), The Low Spark and High Heeled Boys, the instruments each sounded clear, the horns throught out were very airy, the earbuds presented a great multi-dimensional sound stage. Each instrument coming from it\'s own location. The voice being precisely center stage. The Bass was the only thing that seemed a bit lacking, but with this live performance the sound is much different than the original recording I\'m more accustomed to. I then went to Pink Floyd\'s beautiful DSOTM (Live from Immersion Edition). Speak to Me sounded great, the volume level was wonderful, opening up the subtle notes of the song. I had the volume at about 90% volume knowing they could be louder. The subtle tones were great, and as the song builds it had real presence. The highs in Time were tremendous, these earbuds provide an excellent sharp/crisp high end. Then Great Gig In the sky\'s ethereal voices, wisp around the soundstage with the bass just a little weak, but still a nice balance. Money plows in with a very real entry, I turned up the volume to 100% and it was still perfectly clear. But it was even better louder. Us and Them was most tremendous, it got me turning my head, like I could hear the different instruments right in front of me. As we ended with Eclipse I felt like the little voices in my head would persist, but they faded away, as usual. Then went to Boston\'s first album; More than a feeling was forward, and the bass felt very natural with airy highs. On Foreplay/Long time the fade in/out fade had great separation and was excellent. The subtle build up was nearly perfect. And the bass was better on this album; deep but not over done. Here I tried using equalizer, I loved having all the the options. The bass boost was nice but I quickly tired of it. I tapped the earbuds to advance the song, it work as I expected. The touch controls can be programmed as you desire (a great feature usually only found on more expensive products). The software can also control what Jlabs calls Be Aware, where some outside sounds are brought into the sound stream of the earbuds. You can set a percentage that ""passes"" thought. This was somewhat effective, but at louder music levels the effect diminishes. I went outside, with Be Aware set to 0%, and could not hear birds over the music, with Be Aware set to 90%, during quite passages I could hear the birds, but not when it was much louder. So I\'m not sure how effective it is. I\'m very happy that Jlabs provides a burnin tool, I\'ve used others to break earbuds, headphones and speakers before. I love that they provide a full graphic equalizer, it works superbly. This earbud version does not have Automatic Noise Cancelation, another model does if it\'s important to you (airplane travel is the only place I use it). These exceptional earbuds for the price, I\'ve recently tried others 4x the price that I would not say sounded any better. These are close to the best earbuds I\'ve ever used; better highs, with some bass trade offs. After using them all day, I found them very comfortable, (I\'d still prefer the blue memory form inserts). But after wearing them nearly all day I rarely thought about them (other than how nice they sounded). Jlabs has built another great reasonable priced set of earbuds. I like the new case with the hidden charging cord. The case can\'t be charged wirelessly (that would be another step up).

My husband has been through several brands and this has by far been the best. He Uses them mostly at the gym. The connection is awesome he can walk around from one end of the gym to the other and still have clear audio. The fit is also good haven't fallen out. The battery charge is fantastic. He fully charged them and for days can use them without a recharge. Typically uses them for a hour or two at a time. The features for answering calls ect he has not used but would say they are easy to navigate. They are also sweatproof. I would say these would make a great gift for anyone in the market for earbuds."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The development of JLab’a earbuds have been getting better each year. To be honest all of the JLab buds I own are pretty amazing and it’s definitely a trusted earbud brand. What I like about most are the interchangeable earbud pieces and the additional rubber grip around the larger part of the bud. This outer grip provides some holding power to keep your buds in your ear. Great for moving around. I also like the charging case because JLab seems to always include the USB A charger built in. It’s so convenient because as long as you have your charging case you are set and I only ever see JLab integrate this in. The usb is directly wired to the case and pops out and snaps in so easily. Although, one might think what happens if the usb breaks or rips off you can’t use a new cord. However, I don’t think this is true as JLab has done a great job making this charging cable simplistic and well built so no troubles here. The cord is also short so nobody will trip on it, etc. The buds sound pretty good and although they are not equipped with active noise cancelling they do keep out a lot of outside noise. Pretty cool for not being noise canceling. The sound quality rocks and I can’t complain. Have I listened to better? Sure, but these will do. The buds are sweat and dust proof which is pretty standard. In addition, they state each bud last over 9 hours each and the case provides 27 hours of additional charge. I don’t know how long the buds take to charge in the case though. The one thing I didn’t like is there is no app to control these buds so everything is based off of taping the sensors on the buds. What this means is you have to tap them to change the sound profile and you don’t have much for custom adjustments. An app would be great. It also took me a few minutes to figure out how to connect the buds to my iPhone. Had to read the directions two times but I got them to work.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JLab - JBuds Air Pro True earbuds are a good option for working out. They stay pretty snug in your ear. You have like 3 other rubber ear insert options to find the best fit. Making sure they fit good ensures the better audio. The audio isn’t too tier but give decent sound. Nothing raspy or annoying lows or highs. Voices are clear. After using the holding pod doubles as a charging port which is pretty standard. Charging doesn’t take long and can be done anywhere. These are great for travel because they can fit in your pocket, purse or luggage. Because of the small size I do find myself losing them and not knowing where I last put them down. It would be cool if the case had a beeping or some sound that could be triggered to be able to find them when they are lost. Lol It could also be doubled as a theft mechanism. If you are looking for a basic pair of affordable earbuds to listen to music or podcasts then I strongly suggest checking these out and giving them a try. Over all they are worth a try.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My wife loves these headphones great for the gym and to tune me out! Lol the sound quality is great. They perform very well.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ll start this review by saying I’ve had JLAB products in the past and I’ve been impressed with them for their quality given their budget-friendly status. They are not $200 dollar price point tech—but for their price point, they do what they promise. I’ve been very happy with the previous earbuds I’ve had from JLAB, which are arguably a run up from these Air Pro Buds. However, these buds had a couple of features I was interested in and a slightly different design. I was hoping they would check a few boxes that the slightly “better” buds I had currently do not check. And, in fact, they do. Also, they are even a little cheaper, and thus I feel even less worried about taking them outside or out into the world, because losing one is not going to be the end of the world. I have, in the past, tripped and knocked an ear bud out while trail running. I found it, but, if I am wearing these and I just can’t find it, it’s not a tragedy. Yet, because they work well, I’d still hate to lose one. So, I’ll be clear: I’m using these buds primarily when I exercise, and primarily when I’m running outdoors. For this reason, I did not care about ANC for this particular pair of buds, but I did very much want a pass-through/ambient setting. These have the “be aware” setting that I’ve become familiar with from other buds, as well as a standard setting for other situations. (i.e., at your desk, on a plane, listening to podcasts privately, etc.). Testing these out on an outdoor run, the be aware worked as it should. It was a little windy, though, and that means that most of what one hears from around them is just wind. I could hear traffic and dogs barking, etc. In other words, as good as I was expecting, and I feel ok wearing them outside while alone. I have used them for phone calls and they do fine. It’s not a great sound, the other person sounds a little distant, and quit, compared to just using the regular phone speaker. However, the receiver of the call reported that they could hear me just fine, no problems. The flip side of this fairly low-key usage on the buds is that I am not obsessing over the sound. It’s not perfect. There are only 3 eq settings, two of which amplify bass. The “bass boost” setting gives plenty of bass, if that’s what you like, but it makes the rest get lost in the mix. Vocals are muted significantly. The “J Labs Signature” can give you big bass with more treble on the top, allowing the vocals to pop out more. This is probably a good mix to keep the feet pumping, but it’s not amazing if you’re just sitting and listening. The “Balanced” setting is probably the best for casual listening and gives more middle tones. Still, some things are a little washed out. But—let’s be honest. We’re talking about wireless Bluetooth earbuds playing, in my case, mps3 or streaming sound. It’s not really an audiophile’s dream. For that, get out the good stereo systems or the wired earphones and the nice CDs. Still, I’d put this audio far above every other brand of cheaper headphones and earbuds I’ve bought. The only close contender is one pair of non-true wireless Bluetooth buds, but those suffered from the neck band hitting my neck rhythmically while jogging, which added some extra noise. For what I’m looking for—reliable sound, decent mix, “be aware” mode, on-board controls, these are really quite amazing at this price point. One other major plus: multipoint connection. I was skeptical that this was going to work, to be honest. One of the few problems I have with my other buds is that they tend to just connect to whatever was last talking to them (and sometimes, well, it seems like they have a mind of their own about how to connect). So occasionally I have to run around the house trying to figure out which device they’ve connected to before I can get outside and listen to the music I have queued up on my watch or my phone. Sure, not that big a deal. But the multipoint actually seems to work! It did take a little trying to setup, but I can be listening to something on the computer, hit pause, turn on something on my tablet (or whatever) and quickly it just picks up the new signal. I was amazed it worked. It may not be perfect—I haven’t tested extensively—but I am encouraged this will take away just one little aggravation. And, finally, for me this pair of buds fits pretty well. The previous pair was OK, but really not great. The slightly fancier buds require, honestly, a bit more real estate and they are not a great match with my relatively small ears. I tend to end up adjusting/pushing them back in a lot. These Air Pros have a little different design than other models I've tried and they work well. They really stick in nicely, and the cush fin is actually a helpful adjustment. The pair comes with three sizes of tips and two sets of fins, one fin is pre-installed. Honestly, they fit me well out of the box, which I was totally not expecting. While running in sweaty conditions, I didn’t adjust them at all in 45 minutes. (Also, the waterproof rating is great. I have killed buds in the rain, so I like having this protection). So, the fit may not be perfect or as nice as some of the $100+ options, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well these work with my ears. Eventually they can feel a little sore. But, again, better than other cheap models I’ve tried. Less than great things: where one misses ANC is in just sitting around and working and listening to music. The seal on the buds is tight enough that you end up hearing yourself breathe and chew and move your mouth, but at the same time, I can still hear a lot around me (my typic, noises, etc.) though actually hearing someone talking is not as easy. This is not a big deal to me, but I won’t be chewing gum while using these. Also, I did have just a bit of drop-out when I had these paired with my watch (which has music on board). Sometimes the signal would drop out with certain arm swings. This happened only when moving my arms across my body or in a less typical pattern—not with normal arm swing jogging or running. The tap controls are numerous and I’ve gotten used to some of this form previous buds, but these do allow one to control a lot through the buds. Volume, sound settings, listening modes, skipping, connecting to an assistant (I did not try to connect, but supposedly this is an option with siri or google), answering calls or hanging up. That said, the tapping can feel a little hit and miss. I had the most trouble the triple taps, but I was getting the feel of these and could make it work. Sometimes it seems to get “stuck” in whatever mode, so instead of reacting three taps as one, it will treat them as, for example, three one taps and just change the volume. It’s not perfect, but not something that makes me feel any less good about these. If you want a good set of buds that will get your through your workout and maybe your work day, and still have money left over at the end of the day, these are for you."", 'Tiight fitting comfortable buds in my ears, they are very discreet in the fact that they are practically invisible to the Ring Wraiths. As I made my way from my home in the Shire jamming to classic hits of Tom Bombadill and The Lonely Mountain Men (The Dwarves) I could tell these earbuds were the absolute best I had ever acquired from my Uncle Bilbo . The operating system is very simple and sound absolutely amazing. I can run with Merry and Pippin, fight of Orcs and get carried half alive on horseback from an elven goddess with them still in my ears when I arrive , all while STILL making it across Middle Earth to Mount Doom on one recharge. The convenience is the case that I’ve “kept secret and safe.”. It recharges the earbuds! So when we stopped at Rivendell to establish “The Fellowship” I had to give them a quick recharge in the case to be on my way. My favorite part is the “ Noise Canceling” feature. I don’t have to listen to the corny riddles from that little cave dwelling goblin Gollum and the fact that all I see are him and Sam rolling down the hill (one can assume they’ve been fighting) but I’ll never know because I couldn’t hear them over “ the great vibrato and bass of the “ Misty Mountains.” The quiet with just music surrounding you is really nice while enjoying the scenery of Middle Earth in its entirety while knowing you’re probably going to die anyway! 10/10 Reccomend!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have tried various models of ear buds trying to get the right balance of comfort, features, volume control, sound quality, connectivity, and battery life. While these scored well on several fronts, I still find myself using others for different purposes. This model does not offer noise cancellation (another JLABS model does), so I was unable to hear using these earbuds when there was a lot of ambient noise. The controls are pretty simple but do require carrying around the instruction manual for a few days until you learn some of the less-used commands. I do like that the pairing process was quick and easy - connected on the frit try. I also like that the earbuds each tells you when they are on, when they connect, and their corresponding battery level. The battery life is very satisfactory. I've never run out of battery during the time that I was using them. The charging case is a little unusual in that it has its own USB-A cable built into the bottom of the case. That makes the case a little larger than most. It is only a 2-inch cable, so when extended it does not really lie flat. This is not a problem, just an observation. The biggest concern I have is the comfort. I was able to wear them for about 2 hours tops before they felt large and uncomfortable in my ear. I am playing around with different tips to see if I can find one that provides comfortable wear for a longer period of time. I also tried to wear them while on a treadmill. They manages to stay in, but because of the discomfort, I prefer to wear around-the-ear style for exercising. Of all my earbuds, this is not my favorite.""]"

Super convenient I use these at work. I use these at home. I use these when I’m working out. I can honestly say LG headphones were my favorite at appointing time but these have been my go to option every since then the connection set up is very easy and I love the fact that they’re very loud if you work in a factory and so on, the price is pretty reasonable for the most part I will go with these every single time if I had to choose and I like the fact that you can purchase a warranty with Best Buy so if anything goes wrong, you just bring them back they trade them in is super worth it I highly suggest', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my second set of Beats Flex. I damaged another pair and decided to try air pods instead. After 2 sets I’m missing 2 pods and 1 stopped working completely. So i gave up and went back to beats. The sound is amazing. They stay on my ear even at the gym and on the rare instance one falls out it doesn’t go bouncing across the floor as I scramble behind it (PTSD). Battery life is good and lasts me the whole day. When it doesn’t i can charge them quickly from my car charger. They connect easily to your device and I’m able to use it with 2 phones throughout the day seamlessly. Highly recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Spent my time outside working in the sun today with these little power house ear buds.

One pair lost sound in one earbud but I was able to tape around the cracks in the second pair to stabilize the damage.

I was happily satisfied with these headphones! I usually stick with my normal pair but after trying these out might switch them out. They are light weight with a functional clip on the side of the case for convenience. The packaging is very sleek and matte providing a futuristic look. They provided clear and full sound with noise cancellation and aware mode. They are also water resistant and charge fast and easily. One thing that is a huge benefit is the price is on the more affordable side with all the same luxuries! Would definitely recommend if you’re looking for a new wireless earphone!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These little guys pack a punch honestly, I wasn’t expecting them to sound as well as they do.

I would recommend as a good affordable option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received these products for free from @influenster and @skullcandy in exchange for my honest review- I love these earphones because they are small and compact meaning you can take them anywhere. They also have a battery life of 20 hours so I do not have to worry about them dying. They are comfortable and stay put in the ear. They have amazing sound making my music and films enjoyable to listen too, as the earphones block out background noise.

I would say for the price you can’t be the quality.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product for free from Influenster and Skullcandy in exchange for my honest review. I was super excited to try these because I personally didn’t have any wireless headphones and have been wanting some for a while. Once I set them up the first time it was easy, but the directions included were kind of vague and small to read. There are still some settings I have trouble figuring out, but once I use them and know I’m sure it will be simple. I like that the headphones charge and the case charges too. It helps the headphones last for a while. I used them on a 5 ish hour flight and then put them back in the case and the next time I used them was on another 5 ish hour flight. I didn’t have to charge them or anything. The case has a little loop to attach to something, I’m assuming, but not sure if that actually helps with securing them. I wish there was an easy way to know how much charge is left in the headphones and how much charge is left in the case. That would make it much easier to know when to charge and how much is left. Overall, I am happy I got to try these and will keep using these as my Bluetooth wireless headphones. The cost for these is low, so if you don’t want to spend a bunch of money on headphones these seem like a good basic option. I don’t know if I would purchase them personally.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are just fine especially for the price. The sound quality is ok. I’m not much of an audiophile but they’re definitely not as good quality as the older AirPods. I also had a lot of technical issues with the case. One of the earbuds only charges intermittently and it has to be right in the right spot for it to charge. It shouldn’t be that difficult considering they fit right into the case to charge but one of them still wasn’t charged on first use because of the contact issue. The instructions are also confusing for pairing more than one device. If you need something cheap and wireless, these are fine, but I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone except for that', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Skullcandy Dime 3’s case is very lightweight. It can be easily clipped to almost anything due to the build in loop. Which makes them incredibly convenient to carry around and quickly access. The earbuds fits nicely in my ears and it was very easy to pair with my phone. I was really impressed with the audio quality. Plus the battery lasts a long time.

PANASONIC TECHNICS PREMIUM NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONES,$378,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/panasonic-technics-premium-noise-canceling-headphones/16371635/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Technics has released some impressive hardware as of late, and these A800 headphones continue that streak of impressive products. The A800 ships with a teardrop shaped rigid carrying case, 3.5mm aux cable, airplane cable adapter, and a USB-C to USB-A charging cable. The body is constructed of metal and plastic, with brushed aluminum end caps on the cups. Build quality feels sturdy with solid construction and a premium feel. I have not observed any cracks, creaking, nor excessive flex along stress points while folding, putting on, or taking off the headphones. They fold easily for storage, and the interior case bottom has a printed diagram illustrating the proper folding position of the headphones. The ear cups have comfortable foam padding covered by faux leather, and the length adjusts with a ratchet style movement. The pads are soft and remain comfortable even during long wearing sessions. The headband is similarly constructed with soft foam and faux leather, and remains mostly inconspicuous during use. There is no pressure on my head from the band and the lightweight headphones remain comfortable even after hours of continuous wear. I also never feel any excessive heat, weight or pressure during wear. The A800 has a snug fit that feels secure, but not constricting. I have a large head, so these are suitable and comfortable for larger heads. Controls are housed on the right ear cup. There are four physical buttons along the rear that control power, volume, track selection, and call functions. Commands are confirmed by voice prompts through the headphones. The side of the right cup can be tapped twice to enable or disable ANC. The noise cancelling works extremely well most times but occasionally misses the mark. When I first placed these headphones on with ANC enabled, I had a nearby washing machine making noise and pipe noise from running water. Immediately all the sounds went silent and I was blown away impressed. I was ready to crown these the ANC king right then and there. However, on another occasion I was surprised to realize I could hear voices speaking nearby and television sound effects when I paused my music. I was perplexed to say the least, but it seems like the ANC is better at handling less dominant background noises than sharper, more pronounced noises. Music sounds terrific through the 40mm drivers. I’ve listened nonstop to several hours of music spanning across multiple genres through these headphones. The sound profile is warm, with clean impactful bass with no muddiness. Highs and mids are clear and pronounced without sounding shrill or flat. Voices project nicely among instruments and all tones balance nicely with no overpowering notes. I can hear every instrument clearly, even in complex arrangements with heavy bass. Every song I listen to has good balance and even sound. Whether it’s hip hop with deep sub-bass, classical with a powerful crescendo, or jazz with numerous wind, string, and percussive instruments delicately balancing among each other, everything sounds excellent, especially in Hi-Res. The headphones also have good loudness. The four-mic array has beamforming and noise suppression for clear conversations. I’ve verified through several calls that I sound clear with minimal background noise while speaking through the headset. During one call, there was a nearby television playing an action movie at moderate volume. The remote party advised they only heard my voice until I increased the television volume to loud to test the limits of the mic noise suppression. The Technics Audio Connect companion app allows additional fine tuning of sound through a choice of either manually tuning using a five-band equalizer, or using one of four presets emphasizing bass, vocals, treble, or dynamic. The app also allows firmware updates, switching the Bluetooth LED indicator on/off, toggling the auto-pause feature on/off, and displays battery status. I can also adjust noise cancelling sensitivity and test microphone quality through the app. Overall, this is a nicely crafted set of headphones with very good sound quality, an excellent quality mic array, and enough extras to provide an enjoyable listening experience. It has outstanding battery life and even announces battery status when I power it off. It’s also lightweight and comfortable, even on large heads like mine. ANC can occasionally allow more sound in than desired, but most of the time it is excellent, especially while music is playing.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Technics EAH A800 Headphones are an outstanding device, highly configurable/customizable to adjust to your needs/preferences. The noise cancelling function is superb, from blocking ambient sound to configuring how much of the ambient noise to allow. Its connectivity option to multiple devices allows one to move from device to device with no effort. It has preset and “manual” sound configurations to enjoy music and videos, it also includes voice enhancement, useful in work or home environments where you need to be alert to voices. And much more. The only complaint so far, and it mainly stems from me not wearing over-ear headphones in ages, is that after some time it starts feeling too hot and uncomfortable. The weight of the device doesn’t seem to help either, but I understand that the features present in this device carry some “weight” with them. - Pros: highly customizable, multipoint pairing, transparent mode, great sound. - Cons: a little heavy. There are several things that can be said about this device, I elaborate on a few of them. >> Technics Audio Connect App To get the most out of your new headphones, download the Technics Audio Connect App. In fact, it should be the very first thing to do (even before connecting it to your cell phone.) With the App in hand, you can configure: - Noise Cancellation. - Sound, predefined settings as well as custom. - Auto power off after some period of time (or not.) - Fitting sensor to detect whether phones are being worn, and what to do when that happens. - Multi-point connectivity (multipoint pairing.) - Giving preference to connectivity as opposed to audio quality. - And others. >> Multipoint Pairing Multipoint Pairing allows more than one device to connect to the Technics A800 Headphones. You need to configure the Multi point option using the App as it doesn’t come pre-configured with it. It only allows 2 devices to connect to the headphones; although, I read somewhere you could have more than 2, but I have yet to find how to configure it as the app only states two devices. Take note, it mentions that the LDAC quality to just be “Best effort” when two devices are connected. If there is any Audio quality lost when in this mode, well, I haven’t noticed it, the headphones are just that great. My two main computer/phone configurations while at home or at the office are: - Laptop and desktop (s) - Phone and laptop For the laptop and desktop(s) configuration, I keep my laptop separated in case I need to jump into a call or conference, and I use one of the desktops to remote into the other machines/desktops/laptops. The multipoint pairing capability comes in handy in this configuration; for example, I can be listening to some music on my desktop and if suddenly I need to jump into a call/conference on my laptop, I don’t need to take off my headphones, I just switch them from one device to the other. One could argue that I only need the laptop to remote connect to all the others; well, I find it more productive using the laptop on its own and the main desktop with all the monitors connected to it. Now, I find it very satisfying when using my laptop and phone on-the-go. For example, in the living room, some shared space, even a coffee place, etc. Wearing the headphones, I can switch from laptop to phone when desired effortlessly; music is interrupted in the laptop while I take care of business with the cellphone, after finishing, I press play again on the laptop and I can hear the music playing again. >> Noise Cancelling If you need to focus on work while listening to some great music without getting the annoying ambient “noise”, the Technics EAH A800 does an awesome job in that department. Only for that I’d buy these headphones, it just outperforms whatever I have in hand nowadays. And you can even customize: - Allow less or more ambient sound. - Allows transparent mode (sounds around are allowed with no change.) - Has an “Attention” setting to allow voices around to be emphasized. I’ve seen some of these features in other in-ear headphones, but I must recognize, the Technics EAH A800 outperforms those others by a good margin. A must-have indeed. >> Comfort In general, the device is very comfortable; however, as a heavy in-ear headphones user for the last couple of years, I cannot stand the headphones for a long period of time. I feel the pressure of the device on top of my head and on the sides, which eventually becomes a nuisance, to the point I prefer to take them off and continue without music. I think the weight of the headphones contributes to this problem, and it is going to take some time to get used to them. >> Couple of observations - It has great battery life (perhaps also a contributor to its weight.) - I have the headphones configured so that when I take them off the music stops playing. But it is not always the case, if you take them off slowly with care, they keep on playing your favorite music! - I’ve had an intermittent issue where music would stop playing on one device when in multipoint mode. I still need to determine what is happening, it could be me touching something inadvertently.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] UNBOXING: Before I’ve even opened the box, I’m surprised at how insanely light everything is. It was shipped to my house and I was surprised at how light the shipping box was. Inside the box, you’ll find the standard documentation as well as the headphone zipped up into the travel case. Opening the travel case, you’ll find the headphone as well as a USB-C charging cable, a 3.5mm cable, and an airplane adapter. BUILD: Right off the bat, picking up the headphones you will realize how light they feel. I weighed my pair at 299g which is still heavier than the most popular options from other brands in this price segment. The plastic on the Technics has a bit of a cheaper feeling compared to some other active noise canceling headphones in its price bracket. That being said, it doesn’t seem like the material used is actually structurally worse. I’m not sure if I should have any concerns regarding its structural integrity, but for the asking price I do think the build quality could have at least been better feeling. The included case is also quite light, has a soft texture, and has space for the included cables and airplane adapter, and also has labels to make it obvious how to fold the headphone when stowing it away in the case. COMFORT: Different people have different needs when it comes to comfort, but I think the Technics EAH-A800 does some things well while also needing improvement in others. Out of the box, the ear pads and the headband were a little bit more stiff compared to the competition, and while over time I do feel that the ear pads eased up, the clamping force was still enough to cause some discomfort over time (especially since I wear glasses), and the headband padding caused a hotspot of discomfort at the apex of my head. That being said, I’m pretty sensitive to headband pressure, so this isn’t a headphone I could wear for hours without taking a break. That being said, I brought these to work and used them on and off with breaks throughout the day and didn’t consciously think about pain as long as I was taking breaks. But for a longer flight, I don’t think these would be particularly great for me, but your mileage will certainly vary. I would recommend Technics revise their headband material, and I think their clamp force is less of a problem after a break-in period, but I also noticed it’s easier to break the seal which can trigger the CONTROLS: The controls on this headphone are simple, but honestly just not distinctly placed for easy access. Even across the days I’ve been using it, I still fumble to press the play/pause button and sometimes accidentally press the volume down button or the power button. Because the volume and playback controls are grouped so closely together, it’s just inevitable you’re going to make mistakes pressing the buttons. I think if they had used some sort of protruding dots like braille on the play/pause button, this could have made finding the controls much easier when they’re on your head. You can double-tap on the right ear cup to toggle between the active noise cancellation and ambient sound modes. And taking the headphone off your head can pause playback and resume upon putting them back on your head. However, I’ve found that this has more delay compared to the competition, and Technics advertises it as resuming within 60 seconds which is absurd for claiming it to be a “seamless” operation when other products will reliably resume in less than a few seconds. APP: The app includes numerous customization features for controls, ANC strength, toggling the “headphone fitting sensor”, “touch sensor”, a basic 5-band EQ, and microphone noise reduction strength for calls. You can also enable/disable LDAC if you have a supported device, change between signal strength and playback quality, and also enable multipoint connectivity. Overall, I found the app to be of good quality—especially for a brand that isn’t known for headphones. I was surprised to find such a large number of features and customization. SOUND: As an audiophile, I try to lower my expectations regarding the sound profile of active noise canceling headphones. However, Technics is also a brand that is better known for their high-end Direct Drive turntables, so I think it’s fair to think that they want to appeal to those with a discerning ear—especially when their price is competing with some of the most well-known ANC headphones. The stock sound signature was pleasant out of the box. It delivers a fun bassy signature without the midbass bloat that a lot of other consumer-grade ANC headphones tend to impose. It also delivers a good midrange that isn’t too accentuated or fatiguing but also not so recessed that it sounds dull or muffled. You can make some tweaks with the 5-band EQ in the app if you have deviating preferences, but I’ve been very happy to find that Technics is delivering an enjoyable audio experience that lets me be immersed in my music. Whether it’s Pop, R&B, Metal or Electronic, I never really felt like I was getting a dulled experience on the EAH-A800. ANC / AMBIENT SOUND: I’ve reviewed numerous ANC headphones from cheap $50 truly wireless in-ears to my $800 audiophile pair of ANC headphones, and I think Technics has ANC performance that rivals the most popular competition. The ANC on the EAH-A800 can exhibit more of an ANC “pressure” feel compared to some other options, but the noise cancellation performance is very good. Playing rain sounds, white noise or traffic noise on loudspeakers, the Technics is able to suppress an incredible amount of low-end and midrange droning noises. If you’re not listening to music or other content, you’ll be more likely to hear noises like speech or intermittent sounds, but if you listen to music at relatively low volumes, it will certainly do wonders to negate outside sounds and keep you immersed. I most often used the Technics at my workplace which is an open-office floor plan with plenty of people chatting, keyboards clacking, etc. These headphones let me ignore all the noise and chatter around me and be focused on my work while listening to music. The Ambient Sound mode can also be surprisingly good. The app lets you switch between “Transparent” and “Attention” profiles for this mode. In my experience, the Transparent profile is clearer with just a bit of muffling, but the noise floor is surprisingly low compared to other headphones with transparency modes. Overall, it’s pretty clear, and you can hear yourself pretty well, but with a minor volume decrease. The “Attention” profile on the other hand I was not a fan of. It has an emphasis on voices, but I actually found that it was harder to depict what was being said if too many other voices or noises were also present, since this mode amplifies those noises, as well. So depending on the circumstance, it can be much more harsh. So I think the “Transparent” profile will be better for most situations. One thing to note, however, is that these headphones are a little bit more sensitive to quick movement such that they might induce strange popping noises if you’re walking, chewing, etc. There were times where it was much more reproducible and others where it was not; so your mileage may vary. MICROPHONE: The EAH-A800 boasts 8 MEMS (microelectro-mechanical systems) microphones in total. 3 external to each ear cup, and 1 internal to each ear cup. This plays a role in the aforementioned ANC and Ambient Sound modes, but the external microphones are also used for calls and for reducing microphone noise on calls to make your voice clearer. In my testing, I found that the microphones did an impressively good job at blocking noise. I tested the microphone by recording myself in the app using the “Call Quality Test” and talking over background voices, TV shows, droning noises, etc. I found that the best performance was by setting the background noise reduction setting to “Strong” instead of the default “Normal”. That being said, there’s definitely some improvement to be made in terms of clarity, but I didn’t encounter issues with distortion. Overall, I feel like it would be a good choice for taking calls in noisy environments. BATTERY: Technics claims up to 40 hours if you use a device with LDAC enabled, and up to 50 hours on AAC or SBC codecs. In my experience, I feel comfortable agreeing with this claim, and you can always set it to turn off when it idles. And in a quick pinch, a 15 minute charge can yield 10 hours of listening time. CONCLUSION: The Technics EAH-A800 is a pretty impressive ANC headphone for the price. My biggest critiques are in regards to the comfort and build materials—which aren’t bad, but I do think could be better. That being said, I do think the sound quality can be appealing for more discerning listeners who want a controlled, balanced bass response and plenty of midrange energy without being fatiguing. But the biggest surprise for me is how good the ANC is. You don’t often find ANC of this performance on a brand’s first ever over-ear ANC headphone. And its “Transparent” mode and call quality is also quite good thanks to its 8 onboard MEMS microphones. I look forward to any firmware updates that Technics might deliver, and would be very optimistic about future ANC headphone endeavors they consider based on community feedback. If you find this headphone on sale for a price below the competition, I’d say it’s especially worth your consideration if audio performance and ANC is your primary concern.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Technics makes top tier audio hardware, but I can’t remember it ever being acclaimed for its headphones. The A800 changes that, at least it should. For the features that matter most in wireless headphones at this price they do almost everything either great or well: long wear comfort, acceptable active noise cancellation, and stunning battery life. My only disappointment is its wobbly, poorly designed and located buttons. Equipped with the recent-enough Bluetooth version (5.2), It’s LDAC compatible. Audio quality is on point with a filling, yet low processed, presentation. For me the sound is “Goldilocks.” I’ve yet to be disappointed regardless of what genre I’m listening to, provided the recording is a decent quality. Here are some more in-depth impressions after “testing” them for a couple days following a day of break-in to loosen them up. AUDIO QUALITY I’ll start with sound quality since that’s the prime reason to buy one pair of headphones over another. I get the concept of sound quality in this context is more personal than universal. For me, my library is 60s- early 80s rock, mid 80’s and forward “alt rock,” plus big band jazz and classical. I have no hip-hop genres, so definitely, I don’t have an ear for what “good” extra-heightened bass tuning should sound like. What I want out of headphones is a faithful, minimally processed, rendition of whatever song I’m playing. In my experience so far, the A800 delivers this -- provided the source audio is quality. To test the A800’s capabilities and limitations, I sampled a variety of different genres with the app’s sound profiles off, noise cancelling at 50%. All but “HIP HOP” were with 320kbps AAC on an iPhone Pro Max 14 at 60-70% volume in a quiet room. I’ll explain my hip hop experience in that section. ROCK: Rush, “YYZ.” This is a challenging bass-centric instrumental and one of rock’s all-time best. The A800 passed with ease. The bass was crisp with no distortion except for what Rush intended. The drums were tight and the windchimes distinct. It made me want to grab my air guitar out of my front pocket and strum along. Admittedly, when I turned down the volume to 50% it lost some tonal excitement, but neither YYZ nor anything Rush is intended to be background music. This is arena rock meant to be played loud. VOCALS: Brandi Carlile, “The Stranger At My Door.” Her vocal range and storytelling mixed with an emotional guitar thumping are a perfect match for the A800s neutral stance. There was a presence and clarity like I was on Row 1 at an unplugged concert. Ironically, the distortion-for-effect at the end of the song sounded too clear. HIP HOP: Here I had to resort to Spotify Free for some samples. My mistake. A 128kpbs stream can’t provide big bass hip hop justice. It needs more bandwidth. At this bit rate these songs sounded lifeless. With nothing to lose I went to YouTube and found a collection called “Gangster Trap Mix 2023.” I don’t know what the bit rate was but as soon as “Candy Shop,” started I knew I was on the right track. Literally. I felt musical excitement. The tight boomy bass and quick, but clear, lyrics made me want to go clubbing… at 4pm, and I’m well past my clubbing days. The next song, “Drift,” had the same emotional effect. Again, hip hop isn’t my genre, but the A800s offered plenty bass to get me going. It may be the A800s are not super-bassy, but I don’t find them lacking at all. If you find them flat check the quality of your recording. DESIGN & FIT The A800 ships inside a zippered semi-rigid synthetic leather case worth keeping. It appears to be durable and protective unlike many of the “throwaways” some companies utilize. Inside, the A800 is neatly folded into the headband to save space. This is an unsung feature that minimizes its storage footprint. When I travel I’m grateful for every inch I can save. Additionally, the earpads extra agility allows it to fit closer to the ear than ones that only fold flat. Technics also includes a USB-A to USB-C charge cable, an old-school airplane adapter, a 3.3’ 3.5mm headphone cable for wired listening, and a card explaining the various buttons “IKEA pictogram style”. The A800 is handsome with a mix of matte and semi-metallic looking plastic. The headband and earpads are covered with a buttery-soft leatherette. While the plastic bits feel average, the leatherette areas that actually touch your ears and head feel luxurious. The memory foam padding is thick, but not firm, and responsive enough to give hours-long comfort. The earpad hole is approximately 2.5” by 4.5” so it should accommodate even the largest of ears. I have small ears and did not find them too big either. The headband can vertically extend an additional 1.5”. The headband’s flex is good. I stretched it about 7.5” wide before fearing I might damage them. The A800 weighs nearly 11 oz but doesn’t feel heavy when worn (I’m not a big person). They are neither “light and airy,” nor “boat anchors” pulling your head down. The earpads are comfortable over hours of continuous wear. I didn’t feel them ever slipping when moving around or feeling too tight. The do get a bit hot after a while. SETUP & USAGE Setup is semi-automatic and does not require registration or use of Technics Audio Center app. Simply go to the Bluetooth control on your device and select the A800. To pair an additional device, press the power button for 7 seconds to enter pairing mode. The app’s main use is to adjust the amount of noise cancelling (didn’t do much for me), to customize sound frequencies, turn LDAP on, and, most importantly, to turn off the annoying blinking “on” LED indicator on the right earpad. BTW, unlike similar apps from other manufacturers the app still works if you don’t agree to the privacy policy. Thumbs up for that. Controlling the A800’s varies from frustrating to tolerable depending on how you are doing it. I have mine paired to my iPhone and Mac, so fortunately my devices volume buttons work here. The A800’s volume and transport/mic controls and their placement are terrible and seriously deduct from the user experience in my opinion. These three buttons are butted up next to each other with only a tiny nub separating them. For added awkwardness they are on the far back of the right pad. Not only is this an uncomfortable reach, but invariably when go to these buttons it erroneously activates the touch sensitive “noise cancellation/ambient noise” switch on the side. Touch sensitivity can be turned off but then you lose the ability to toggle noise cancelation on the A800s and have to do this in the app. So, here’s an example of this nonsense. I’m walking down the street and a loud song comes on. I reach to the back of my ears to lower the volume. Because the buttons have no separation between them I have to feel around so I don’t hit a button by mistake. Oops, too late. My palm just flipped the earphones from ambient mode to noise canceling. I could go on but, hopefully it’s a good enough illustration. As a side note, the buttons themselves are thin and flimsy and feel more appropriate for a $39 pair of headphones. ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION A headphone’s ability to block out airplane cabin noise is, I feel, the best way to judge the effectiveness of noise cancelation. Unfortunately, I had no flight plans this week, so I did a noise simulation using my TV’s volume. The average cabin noise at cruising altitude in a commercial jet is 70 dB. So, using my Apple Watch to measure, I raised my TV’s volume to an ear damaging 88 dB. This to replicate takeoff and landing noise. I had to walk 30 feet away before I could no longer hear the TV. Next I decreased the volume to 66 dB for cruising altitude levels. Here all outside noise was immediate blocked out once with the A800s at 50% volume. So my guess is, and it’s only that, the A800 noise cancellation is perfectly fine for the majority of a flight but expect some leakage at takeoff and landing. I also did a “real world” test wearing them for a walk down my noisy street – lots of cars, buses, etc. In this instance all outside noise was 100% blocked out at 50% volume. Of note: the noise cancellation % wheel inside the app didn’t seem to have any effect ever though I did hear more “white noise” at 100% than 0 or 50%. BATTERY LIFE Battery life (noise cancelling on, LDAC off) is rated at an impressive 50 hours. That crushes its competitors by a lot. In my use I’ve found this to be right on target. Incredible one could fly to Australia and back on a single charge. Wow. But if the battery dies at the wrong time a 15 quick charge supplies 10 hours of listening. A full charge takes about 4 hours. BLUETOOTH Almost as important as battery life is Bluetooth range. I tested range vertically and horizontally. First I left my phone in the lower level of my 4-level open floorplan townhouse and went to the top floor 30 feet up. The signal remained solid the entire trip up. Next, I left my phone in the lower level and walked away from my house until I started to get dropouts. This happened at about 30 feet as well. This is in-line with BT’s range so I’m happy with this performance. The A800 can connect to two devices simultaneously for multitasking. So, for example, you can wear them for TV audio and instantly switch to your phone if a call came in. Oh, and the A800 has 4 beamforming microphones that yield good voice quality and background noise removal for phone calls – based on comments I received by people I talked to with the A800s. From my end, the voice quality was OK, though a bit thin and hollow.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far so good. I’m bald with a big head so headphones like this I usually don’t care for. These types of headphones usually make you sweat profusely around your ears when you remove them. Things I really like: Comes with a case. The case stores all the accessories as well as the headphones, very easily. The ear pieces are clearly marked “L” & “R”. (see photo) How many times have you grabbed over-ear headphones and had a heck of a time finding out which side is which. NO guessing here. The case is also marked showing how they should bend and sit, in the case. (photo) Sound quality and noise cancelling ability, is very good quality. Ability to use these for work. I work from home two days per week. I usually use my ear pods, but swapping the Bluetooth on them from the pc audio, back to my phone is a hassle and delayed. With these Technics, it’s pretty effortless, you just have to set up the Bluetooth in the app to use 2 devices at the same time. Things I didn’t really like: Aforementioned app. The app could’ve been a little less involved in my opinion, and more user-friendly. Button functions on headphones. Not the most intuitive, and not the best to get used to Still rate these 5 out of 5 due to the sound quality, thoughtful little details like the case, easy storage, easy to tell which side is which. I bet they would be on Par for sound, with most big name players in the over-ear headphone game.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Technics EAH-A800 are great new headphones that combine style, comfort, and outstanding sound quality all in a 10.5oz package. As an audio enthusiast, I had high expectations for these headphones, and they were simply exceptional. The first thing that caught my attention when I unboxed the EAH-A800 was their beautiful clean modern look. The brushed metal accents and smoothly rotating well padded ear cups are some of the premium features that stand out. The build quality is exceptional, with sturdy yet lightweight construction. The band and ear cup swivels look and feel extremely durable and capable of withstanding daily use. The conservative Technics branding is welcome. Technics includes a beautiful hard case that holds the headphones and accessories A USB A to USB C charging cable, a mini 3.5mm RCA input cable and an airline dual mini 3.5mm RCA adapter. The PEEK/Polyurethane ear cushions are soft with just the right amount of firmness to provide an excellent seal without exerting too much pressure on the head or ears. The headband is adjustable and well-padded providing a secure and comfortable fit for different head sizes. I found that I could wear these headphones for hours without any discomfort. The EAH-A800 delivers on sound, the Technics reputation for Audio shines through here. The 3-Layer Diaphragm 40mm driver dynamic drivers faithfully reproduce audio, allowing you to pick up subtle nuances in your music or movies. The bass is deep and impactful without overpowering the midrange and highs. The profile is adjustable in the Technics audio connect app. The Audio is 96 kHz/24 bit LDAC when connected by Bluetooth. These headphones have exceedingly well-balanced expansive sound, making these headphones great with all types of music. The EAH-A800 features active noise-canceling (ANC) technology, which effectively reduces ambient noise, I found this very effective. Whether you're in a noisy office or on an airplane, the ANC on these headphones is quite impressive and makes a noticeable difference in sound quality when enabled. You can adjust the ANC level in the app. There is initial setup then manual adjustment is possible. There are 8 mics to help with wind noise reduction, superior call quality is provided by 4 Mic Beamforming and Noise Suppression Technology to clearly convey your voice to the listener. The electronics in the headphones combine Dual Hybrid feedforward & feedback noise canceling with analog & digital processing for immersive listening. You have two modes that let ambient sound in Transparent mode comprehensively captures voices and other surrounding sounds and Attention mode that reduces unwanted external noise to make it easier to hear people’s voices. You can also turn off ANC. The Technics audio connect app lets you set the touch control to switch between ANC and your selected ambient sound mode. These headphones support Bluetooth 5.2, ensuring a stable and fast connection to your devices. With Multipoint connectivity you can connect to 2 devices at the same time. This headphone has Alexa Built in so you can select music, adjust the volume, and make phone calls, with your voice. The battery life is respectable, offering 40(LDAC, NC on) to 60 (ACC, NC off) hours of playback time on a single charge. It takes 3 hours for a full charge and 10 min for a “quick charge”. The inclusion of a USB-C port for charging is great. Now I can use my smartphone charger to charge it. The headphones will auto power off after a period of silence you set in the app or can be set to stay on which is the default. I recommend turning on the auto power off during the headphone setup. The Technics audio connect app has a dizzying array of options and handles firmware updates and custom sound profiles as well. The manual is also available from the app. The Technics EAH-A800 headphones combines style, comfort, and exceptional sound quality. I feel the investment is well worth it for audiophiles and anyone who values top-notch audio performance and comfort. Whether you're using them for music, movies, or gaming, the EAH-A800 headphones will elevate your audio experience to a whole new level. Technics has truly delivered an outstanding product with these headphones; I highly recommend them to anyone seeking the best in audio quality and style."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are looking for a pair of wireless over the ear headphones that can deliver amazing sound, block out unwanted noise, and a battery that seems to last forever, you might want to check out the Technics EAH-A800. The sound quality of the EAH-A800 is impressive, with a detailed, dynamic, and balanced performance. You can hear every detail, every instrument, and every voice. They also support high-quality audio formats, so you can enjoy your favorite songs in the best possible way. They also have a hybrid noise-cancelling system that uses feedforward and feedback microphones to reduce ambient noise. The noise cancellation can be adjusted using the Technics Audio Connect app or the touch sensor on the left earcup, allowing you to choose how much of the outside world you wish to hear. The battery life of the EAH-A800 is outstanding, with up to 40 hours of playback time with noise cancellation on, and up to 60 hours with noise cancellation off. They also support quick charging, which gives them an extra 2 hours of playback time with just 15 minutes of charging. The Technics EAH-A800 are not cheap, but the premium price comes with premium build quality and an exceptional listening experience. They are stylish, durable, and easy to use and more importantly I found them quite comfortable to wear for extended periods. The noise cancellation performance is acceptable, but doesn't quite equal the offerings of the best noise cancelling headphones on the market. I would highly recommend them as worthy of a look. The Technics EAH-A800 come with a 3.5 mm cable, a hard storage case, and a USB-C charging cable."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Material quality score 8,5 , because you can tell it's not made of cheap plastic, and the ear cups are extremely comfortable and have plenty of depth and space for large ears. Noise cancellation score 8.7, because I used them at the gym and they eliminated more than 85 percent of the noise. Sound quality score 9.3, very good instrument separation, very high volume and no noticeable distortions, it gets a very good dynamic range. The bass is very good, rating 9 too , very clean bass . Conclusion: All that was missing was a resistance to sweat and dust, because if it had it would be a 9.7, but since it doesn't have it, the final score is 9."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Technics A800 over ear wireless cans are really nice. Like, really nice… They are loud and proud, detailed without being fatiguing, and are very comfortable for long listening sessions. LDAC compatibility is a huge surprise here, not something you see very often in a set of Bluetooth cans, but very welcome for those that have an Android phone or LDAC transmitter. It allows for 24/96 wireless transmission of audio and really makes the A800’s sing. A surprising omission by Technics is the lack of AptX support. I know AptX is not as desirable to audiophiles as LDAC is, but for some of us that have a wireless turntable with AptX capability, it would have been nice to listen to it over the A800’s. The A800’s support the old school SBC codec, as well as AAC and the coveted LDAC. Most of my listening was done using a phone with AAC support, although I did break out an old Android device I had and streamed Hi-Res files using the LDAC codec. In addition to the excellent sound quality, the A800’s also come with noise cancelling capability and talk ability. This last one came in really handy, as I connected it to my work computer and used the A800’s to attend meetings on Teams. Everyone I talked to told me that my voice came through loud and clear, and even though there was plenty of background noise (I intentionally played loud music on my stereo during the conversations) they only heard my voice. Pretty cool. The noise cancelling function was pretty good. I have had better noise cancelling in other over the ears made by a company that starts with a ‘B’. But the sound quality of the A800’s blow away any other over the ear can I’ve had. First set of Bluetooth headphones that actually got loud enough for me to turn the volume down. For music listening, I started out with an AAC lossy version of Fleetwood Mac’s Never Going Back Again. Several acoustic guitars and bass play throughout the track. On a lesser set of cans, this song can sound convoluted and harsh. Not so on the A800’s. The sound of the pick striking the strings could be heard before the string itself, and the warmth and midrange detail was excellent. Very surprising from a lossy Bluetooth stream! I moved onto Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk next, listening to the slap of the drums and the growl of the bass. Very impressed with what I heard. I turned up the volume to max, and at no point did the A800’s sound like they were struggling nor did I hear a DSP kick in and start filtering out some of the low bass. I moved on to another genre, playing an old Neil Diamond song I like to use for listening sessions called Soolaimon (in lossy AAC). This song on the wrong set of cans can literally make you rip the headphones off. It can be very thin and harsh. The A800’s handled the sizzling top end beautifully. The percussive instruments sounded full and deep. Again, I was extremely impressed. This coming from a lossy Bluetooth codec and lossy AAC file. I switched over to LDAC, synced the cans to an old Android phone and streamed Marco Polo (24/96 resolution) by Loreena McKennit. This song has over 40 instruments in it, and on many headphones can just be a big mess. Not so with the A800’s (which seem to love the LDAC codec, providing sound that bettered wired cans that I have). When Loreena began singing, her voice sounded like it was rising up from among the instruments and floating in the air. Truly amazing. The deep bass resonated without being bloated, and the midrange was warm and full. Wow, I can’t believe Bluetooth cans can get this loud and sound this good! I finished off with a 24/44.1 stream of System of a Down’s ‘Attack’. This song is full of shredding guitar work; yelling, screaming, and vibrant vocals; and a thunderous drum line. Serj Tankian’s voice was heard clearly over the insanely fast beat, there was an awesome growl to the guitar, and I could clearly hear the bass line under it all. I don’t know if you can tell, but I really, really liked the A800’s. I am bummed about the omission of AptX and AptX HD. There is no Dolby Atmos support for Apple listeners either. But, the noise canceling function and the ability to use the A800’s for talking are just added caveats to an amazing sounding over the ear headphone. You can download the Technics app and access EQ functions and noise cancellation setup. I tried some of the EQ settings (Dynamic really let it rip!) but ended up just sticking with no EQ. The A800’s sounded that good. Highly recommended.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Technics EAH-A800 promises flagship quality and performance for the over ear headphone segment. Given the competition in this space, there are many headphones to compete against, including well-known brands. With solid noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life, the Technics has a lot going for it but does fall short in a few areas compared to other headphones in this segment. Let’s look at what the A800’s has to offer. In the Box: - Headphones with carrying case - Short USB-A to USB-C cable - 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable - Airplane 3.5mm adapter - Warranty Info, Quick Start Material Setup: Pairing the headphones is done like most other devices on the market. Hold the power button until you hear “pairing” and then go to your desired device and finish the setup process. These headphones do support quick pairing but not on the first setup from my experience with the Pixel 7 Pro. Downloading the Technics Audio app will allow for additional setup and configuration as well as software updates when available. One can control ANC, EQ settings, touch sensor controls, voice assistance settings, etc. I was expecting to see a software update out of the box but so far, I haven’t seen one for these headphones. The A800’s support Sony’s LDAC codec which allows for one of the highest quality sound transfer methods available for wireless headphones. When connecting to my Pixel 7 Pro, it automatically sets LDAC and uses Bluetooth 5.2. The streaming quality seems to be great. Sound Quality/ANC: The A800’s use 40mm drivers, which are a common size for premium, over ear headphones. Out of the box, the EQ is very close to what I like. The bass is punchy at medium to high volumes and the highs are clear. Tweaking the EQ can be done through the app but for most of my listening I left it right where it came from the factory. Overall, I would say the headphones provided class competitive sound quality and what I would expect from the price point these are competing within. The ANC has several different levels to choose from as well as automatic settings based on your ambient environment. This is one of the highlights of these headphones. Overall ANC performance was extremely good with a little “white noise” to be heard while the headphones were idle or not playing music, but this is normal for ANC headphones. The amount of background noise able to be cancelled out rivals some of the best in the industry. Comfort: When it comes to comfort, this was one of my biggest issues. The headphones do not have great comfort over long periods of listening. After just 30-45 minutes, I found myself needing to take them off for a break. The cushions on the headband and earcups are not as soft as some of the competition. In addition, these headphones are 15-20% heavier than some of the others in this segment which was felt in the neck over time. The additional weight likely has to do with the additional metal pieces on the outside of the earcups and overall build quality, but the additional weight created a comfort issue for me after a short time. Features: Following others in this space, the A800 has a touch sensor on the right side of the headphones. It works very well and can control ANC mode and calling features. I am not a fan of the automated voice used for the mode changes and battery levels. It seems very rough and not pleasing to listen to when changing ANC modes or checking battery level. Battery: Technics claims these are good for up to 40 hours using LDAC and up to 50 hours on AAC or SBC codecs. With my time using them, I think they are good for roughly the quoted length of time. These do support quick charge where a 15-minute charge can yield up to 10 hours of listening. Issues: After just a short time of using these with a Pixel phone, I had issues where playback would automatically pause randomly. Well, this would happen every couple minutes and I determined this to be an issue with the wear sensor in some fashion. When it happened, you could either play using the device (phone) or take the headphones completely off and put them back on and it would resume. I ended up turning the feature off in the app and it never happened again. Hopefully they can fix this with a software update (and it isn’t a hardware fault). Pros: - Active noise cancellation (among the best) - Sound quality - Bluetooth 5.2, LDAC codec - Color choice (Black and Silver) - Quick charging capability - Attractive design Cons: - Poor Comfort (Heavy, Stiff Cushions) - Wear sensor issue (Software?) Overall, I was impressed with what the Technics A800 has to offer. With solid sound quality, amazing ANC, and a competitive feature set, they have the potential to be near the top in the, premium, over ear segment. With the few glitches I experienced, and a serious comfort issue compared to others in this space, I would have a hard time recommending them as my first choice. With that said, they are a solid option to consider.']"

They both have great sound, but these fit better and don't try and fall off your head if you move around. You can also position the headband wherever you like as apposed to the void which can only be worn directly across the top of the head. The ear pads are better on the void because they are cloth and therefore don't get all sweaty after an hour, but cloth covers can be added to remedy that. It's was easier to mute the void by lifting the mic up, but it just takes a little getting used to to use the bottom on the HS70 pro. Battery life is great and the iCue software works great, especially if your keyboard and mouse are also Corsair products.""]"

As a part of the new HS line, the HS55 gaming headphones are a great, affordable pair of gaming headphones. With a simple design that is still much better quality than a lot other brands around this price range, they fit comfortably on the head with 50 mm audio drivers tha don't look like 50 mm drivers. I honestly thought they where 40 at the very most. With that leatherett on the ear cups, wrapping the memory foam for all day gaming, that's a fact. I gamed all day (hours people), until my PC's battery went out twice. And if it wasn't for the cord (which could be a little longer), would've never taken them off. But I had to go get snacks. Playing multi-player games online FPS games, to be more precise, these things have surround sound feature where you can literally hear behind you. In the box, you'll get the headphones and a Y cable adapter for those desk top systems. Again hopfully, you'll have your Desk top close to you. Because that cord man. Dang. The omni-directional mic clarity is very good. It's made with material that can be bent your mouth. I'm telling you this thing is light-weight. Not to mention the flip up to mute feature is present. That's always good. The only minor problem I have is the color ( white) Because of the possible smudging. And that cord needs to be just a little longer. Other than that, these are some top-notch headphones. They work great on my Meta Qest as well. Just thought I'd add that bit of info. So yes, I wholey recommend these."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an excellent, easy, straightforward gaming headset that performs. There is something to be said about wired headset, especially one made like this one. It is comfortable (I cannot tell you how many headsets I have returned due to discomfort during long gaming sessions), sounds good, and the mic is excellent. In the box, you get the headset and a Y-connector (to ensure the headset can connect to other devices, which is nice). Setup is simple……just plug and play. On the left headset, there is a volume knob which is easy to reach. For the mic, it has a flip to mute function, which I LOVE! This device is also Discord certified for those Discord users out there. The sound will not blow you away, BUT it is perfect for all the games I have thrown at it. Hearing footsteps for online games is easy and you don't get crazy bass that you can get from some headsets. As I said before, the mic is great. The flip to mute is so easy to use and SUCH a handy feature, I am always baffled why more headsets don’t have this feature. It becomes second nature unlike a physical button which can be hard to locate at times, depending on the placement. I have had zero issues with people being able to hear me in game or discord. As far as the looks go, you cannot go wrong with white, and gray paired together (imo). It doesn’t try to do too much but looks sleek."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Corsair headset, a 3.5mm to usb adapter are all you need for a good set for gaming. Once I picked them up I noticed they were super light which makes me wonder how long they will last. Cord was decent length but not extra long. The ear cushion is decent as well. Cover my hubbys big ears. Lol. The foam isn’t leather but feels like plastic and will sweat on your head when you are hot. So stay cool my friends. Headset stays secure and don’t move too much but could be more stiff for a better fit around the ears. The microphone mutes when flipped up which is a cool feature. the microphone quality is really good. streaming quality maybe not and there is not lighting on the mic for functionality recognition. The sound quality was a 3.5 stars out of 5. Plenty of treble, little to no base and somewhat raspy. Nothing horrible but sound quality could be better and part of the reason for not rating it 5 stars. Overall these are decent gaming headphones especially for a starting gamer. Good entry level.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I consider myself an avid gamer and audiophile--in the past 8 years, I\'ve bought, auditioned, kept, sold, donated, or returned more than three dozen budget to truly summit-fi gaming and ""serious-minded"" headsets from the likes of Focal, Meze, Sennheiser, Audeze, Kennerton, Oppo, Denon, V-Moda, Razer, Hyper X, RIG, Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach, JBL, Corsair, and SteelSeries--just to name a few. Above everything else, I always rank comfort as the number one priority--if you can\'t stand wearing a headset for more than 20-30 minutes at a time, what is the point in keeping them no matter how wonderfully sublime they sound? After that comes sound-quality...most everything else is just window dressing from there. Now, I am not a bass-head, but I do appreciate an articulate, fast, and palpable/chest thumping low-end. That said, mids are where most of the music lives, so I might often sacrifice just a hair of bass ""quantity"" so long as the bass ""quality"" is still apparent behind a slightly more pronounced or engaging set of mids. I also listen to a lot of female-fronted and acoustical music so I put another premium on airy, detailed, and sparkling highs, but not to the point where they are so hyper-detailed or clinical as to come off as somewhat fatiguing or just--boring. It has been unusual for me to find a single headset that happens to be exceedingly comfortable AND does well in all three of these sonic performance dimensions without making other sacrifices along the way (higher price, lower build quality, fiddly controls, poor mic, etc.), so imagine my surprise when Corsair rolled out a budget headset that just so happens to pull all this off. Mind you, the performance it turns in is totally contingent on the quality of the signal you feed it--there is no included USB dongle, so whatever you use for signal processing, analog conversion, amping, etc., is what you\'re stuck with--but if you don\'t put garbage in, I think you\'ll be incredibly happy with what you get out of the HS55s. Construction feels surprisingly robust, yet these cans are still lightweight clocking in at just around 275 grams with the cable. The matte and satin-finish plastic shell is smooth and thus should not easily pick up and retain dirt and oils. And despite being plastic, it feels very solid and high-density, while the metal headband helps keep the fit reassuring tight and stable on the head. There was absolutely no creaking or cheap-feeling catches or plastic-on-plastic snaps during my bending and twist tests. The rotating mechanisms on the earcups are smooth yet provide enough friction that they stay in place once situated on the head--they fold to a full 90 degrees to allow the headset to lay flat on a table or in a bag/drawer (though no storage bag or sack is included--probably to help keep costs/prices down). Headband sizing is accomplished with a click-stop set of sliders that allow the earcups to move through about 1.5"" of vertical travel. The earcups also have a small range of forward/back tilt on their hangers--maybe five to ten degrees or so--to help dial in the comfort for what I\'m sure is a wide range of head sizes. Thankfully, the curvature of the headband is not so extreme that it creates undue clamping force that results in hot-spots on the top and sides of my head or causes ear fatigue and pain. This is what usually gets a set of cans I\'m auditioning relegated to the ""reject pile"" because so many headsets today seem to have unyielding construction that doesn\'t allow the headband to comfortably conform to the natural shape of my head, or the earpads to rest comfortably on/over my ears. The bottom of the headband and earpads are covered with a very soft synthetic leather that actually feels somewhat thick and substantial. In general, I\'m not a huge fan of synthetic leathers because they can crack and flake over time, but these actually feel like they\'ll hold up fairly well to repeated use with just a bit of reasonable care. The flip-to-mute boom mic does not stow neatly into an integrated slot in the earcup, but it does fold up completely out of the way when not deployed which is nice when I\'m playing a solo game or just listening to music. The smooth, rubber-coated headphone cable is captive on the left earcup (unfortunately). This is about the only real complaint I have with the HS55s because it means I cannot replace the cable alone if one of the connectors starts to go bad down the road. The cable has a combination 3.5mm tip but Corsair included a mic/audio breakout adapter in the box if you need it. At the back of the left earcup is a single rotary volume dial with raised nubs around the edges to help with grip/operation in the blind. That is all there is to the controls on this headset--no fancy RGB and no buttons for EQ selection, 3D sound activation, or a chat/game mixer...you\'ll have to rely on your console or PC to make any such adjustments. The boom mic is a bit of a curiosity compared to the standard round wire-style mic on most gaming headsets. This one is a thin ribbon-like arm with some very strong memory-wire inside to help hold its shape and position (forward or back, not up and down) even after long gaming sessions. At the end of the arm is a mouth-facing omni-directional mic pickup to help ensure decent performance regardless of how high/low it is placed relative to the mouth. In practice, I found voice quality to be exceptionally clear and lifelike in my recordings without any hint of unnatural, watery, or overly DSP-sounding voice compression or cutoff. I cannot speak to its performance in a crowded room with other heated conversations going on, but I did not hear any signs that the mic picked up and amplified nearby droning PC fans or HVAC blowers. Finally, getting down to audio performance, this budget headset really blew me away with how well it rendered complex and multi-layered musical tracks and game soundscapes without getting smeary or feeling slow and imprecise. Bass performance fell along the lines of my preferences--powerful, fast, and accurate but not so overwhelming that it was bordering on painful. Similarly, strings, piano notes, and other highs were reproduced with a great deal of delicacy and definition without getting screechy or sibilant. Thankfully, mids were forward enough that they didn\'t seem hollowed out like you might get from some headsets\' extreme V-shaped EQ. Sure, the Focal Utopias or Meze Empyreans sounded more detailed, accurate, and maybe a bit ""fuller,"" but at the Corsair\'s bargain-basement price, I was shocked at just how nice and FUN the HS55s still sounded in comparison. Again, however, their performance in your rig is going to be largely contingent on the source in use. For my audition, I leveraged the 3.5mm USB dongle included with my Logitech Pro X headset, as well as the 3.5mm unbalanced jack on my Questyle M15 USB DAC/amp. I was immensely satisfied with the results from both--though the HS55s *were* resolving enough that I could easily discern the significant bump in audio quality and performance on the same musical passages when using the M15 (the ability to move up from 16-bit/44Khz to some 24-bit/192Khz and higher HD sound files may have had something to do it with, too). Bottom line--these headphones are surprisingly light and comfortable yet still offer solid build quality, pleasing ergonomics, and dead-simple usability. You will also enjoy some truly exceptional microphone performance and simply wonderful audio quality that is well-suited to music, videos, and even the most active and bombastic game soundtracks. I am pleased to give Corsair\'s latest offering such a resounding recommendation, especially given their budget-oriented price tag.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an excellent, easy, straightforward gaming headset that performs.

The headset is light weight and comfortable, It doesn't feel like you're wearing one, which is great for long periods of gaming. The ear padding is thick and comfortable, so you're not likely to experience discomfort after a while either. The top padding strap over the head is really good as well. There's quite a big of adjustability in the straps, so this should fit a wide variety of head sizes. The Mic is not the best. while playing online and using discord, the team kept letting me know that i was breaking up or fading in and out. made it very inconvenient for trying to strategize and communicate. while the mic is adjustable to some degree, it did not seem to help. This was on CSGO Volume levels were good, but clarity and stereo could use some work. while playing CSGO, i could hear foot steps clearly, but unfortunately, i couldn't tell what side they were coming from. Definitely a disadvantage when trying to stay alive. It's a decent headset for people starting out, or i guess depending on the games you're playing. if you're really intense gamer, its probably not enough for you."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The reason I rated the HS55 headset only three stars is that because these are very simple basic headphones. I only had them on for about 10 minutes and my head already started to hurt from the padding. The ""all day comfort plush memory foam"" earcups are nothing to rave about. In fact, they provided me little to comfort. No matter how I adjust them I do not feel comfortable with these headphones. I do have to say though is that they are light and the speakers were loud and clear when being used on my desktop. This has your basic wired connections for pc, xbox, and PS5/4. Its setup with a 3.5MM connector so you can plug it into most devices like an xbox or playstation controller or even a phone/laptop with a standard headphone jack. It also has a y connector to split mic and speakers for your pc if it has two sperate ports. These are the only two ways you can connect these headphones. Basic. These headphones would be ok for a kid gaming but in reality I could probably see them being used for other needs like a zoom or virtual call. Although they fit my large head and are adjustable perhaps because my head is larger it makes the padding more uncomfortable. This is why I think the headphones would be decent for a kid. The MIC is the best part of this headset. Flip it up to mute and flip it down to start talking. This makes it easy because if its flipped up its out of sight and you know your on mute while if the mic is down and in your field of view then you know you are live.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are decent but not my favorite. They are heavier than I expected for claiming to have lightweight construction. The memory foam ears are nice but the memory foam on the strap changes how it sits on your head. Sound is decent. I tried this out on several devices and it performed well with each of them. The headphones look sleek but the mic just seems out of place. The hinge is a weird design that looks kind of cheap compared to the rest of the headset. The cord is thick and feels sturdy and like it will last over time. Packaging was minimal which is nice and it was secure during delivery. Sound quality is good. Voices and music are crisp and clear. Bass is OK and the volume range is nice. Not sure this would be the best fit for larger heads but worked for me and my oldest son. The white is a nice bright white, matches my white controller nicely if that's important to you. The cord is a decent length too so you don't feel stuck while you're hooked up to it. Overall not a bad headset but not quite 5 star worthy."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice design with premium materials. Comfortable even for those with larger hat sizes. Nice cushioning and surprising sound quality for music and games. I test with rock and classical music and YouTube videos. Boom microphone sounds fine and mutes in the upright position. Dial volume control on single ear piece. No software to install. No batteries or charging to worry about. nice simple setup actually refreshingly simple. Would also make a good spare or travel pair. Single large driver on each side. Volume adequate on my asus and aced gaming laptops. Single cord for microphone and speakers with a split adapter if your console or computer requires split. Corsair products in my experience have been very reliable. Their keyboards are some of my favorites. Like all gaming accessories watch for periodic discounts. Nice simple classy appearance which is easy to find if low light. There are much fancier and more complex headsets but if function and sound quality are all you need try a simple headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I found this headset to be terrific. The design is sharp, solid and very functional. The audio was crisp and clear, the mic was easy to flip for mute and the earpads were heavenly. It is a wired headset, however the unit comes with a special Y-wire connector so you can be sure to be compatible with any interface. The headset is very lightweight and the cord is almost 7 feet long; allowing me to stand up if I need to reach something or just to unwind my legs. I used this headset on several game sessions of over 2 hours. I had no head pinching pain. I wear glasses so for me it is important that the earcups don’t squeeze in too much but still hold firmly to my head. This headset was very comfortable for me and had nice adjustment capability. I also snuck in a couple zoom meetings and the headset including the mic worked perfectly. At this relatively low price point, I think it is the best headset I have used. I would highly recommend this nicely designed headset that has great sound, super soft earcups, and is easy to wear for folks with glasses.']"

Bose QuietComfort In-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds - White Smoke,$229.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bose-quietcomfort-in-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-earbuds-white-smoke/18388126/review,"['When I returned full time back to the office for work I found it difficult to hold conference calls in my cubicle with all the back ground noise. My Bose quiet comfort headphones are noise canceling, but I needed a boost so in May 2024 I purchased the Bose quit comfort ulta earbuds. I love them they cancel out all background noise and fit good. I only found one problem… battery life. I found myself relying so much on them at work I needed another pair. When I saw the new design and affordable price point I was sold. Had to have them and I’m glad I did!!! I absolutely love the new Bose quit comfort earbuds. They are not my back up pair they are actually my main pair and the comfort ulta earbuds are my back up pair. I can’t get over how comfortable the new quit comfort earbuds are. I wear them the full charge of 8.5 hours a day. The fit makes the sound quality and noise canceling amazing. The case is well done with 2.5 in extra charges. From voice control or tap control these buds are so user friendly. If one happens to fall out the sound immediately stops alerting you.Don’t get me wrong that’s earbuds are great for the office, but they are definitely not all about business!! Music sounds the most amazing coming through these earbuds. The bass and sound quality can’t be beat. The case is wire or wireless charging capacities. I really have nothing negative to say at this price point and Bose is a name you can trust.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using these for just over the last week. During that time I feel they’ve been given a very fair trial. I’ve used them on a long train journey, a recent inpatient day case at the hospital and mainly whilst working from home. I’ve owned quite a few pairs of Bose headphones over the years, from over ear, on ear and buds. I prefer to pay extra for decent sound so I can enjoy the experience of listening to music.. not just enjoy the music. To start with, I believe these are a great entry level pair of Bose earbuds. They give good sound, easy pairing, great battery and very good noise cancellation. The style of case is a different shape to my other Bose earbuds and although not a bad design / shape I felt they didn’t have the same kind of texture / premium feel as others have had. Although the pricing does reflect some of these changes. When the case is closed I do feel the case is durable and if dropped the magnet is strong enough to remain closed and protect your earbuds. They come with customisable rubber buds to make sure they fit perfectly into your ear. Once in, they fit extremely well and no amount of head shaking or running knock them out. They are comfortable and snug. They connect extremely quickly to my iPhone and iPad and when answering calls it’s a seamless process from music to call. They offer 3 options of noise cancelling, quiet, aware and off. This isn’t as many or as customisable as other Bose earbud options but these are still very good options. The noise cancelling is truly fantastic that you wouldn’t get from any other brand except Bose. They kept out all train commuter noises. They also managed to keep out all hospital beeping and bustling around. When the app is downloaded you have the option of adding extra bass etc if you feel the sound is a little flat. Overall for the price these are a fantastic pair of Bose earbuds. Undoubtedly Bose do offer more premium versions of these but these offer comfort in ear, secure fit, great sound and superb noise reduction.', 'Although these share the same name as the original Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the 2nd generation brings some notable upgrades. First off, the case design stands out—it’s smaller but slightly thicker than my QuietComfort 2 case due to the removal of the earbud stems. The new matte finish on the case is sleek, and a much-appreciated upgrade is the wireless charging feature, which wasn’t available on the previous model. A key change is the introduction of a dedicated app, Bose QC Earbuds, with a unique ""B"" and ""BCE"" logo. This app gives you full control over your earbud experience, offering features like: Noise Control: You can switch between Quiet, Aware, or Off modes either in the app or by voice commands. In general, noise cancellation is excellent, though I did notice that in Quiet mode, wind noise during outdoor walks seemed more pronounced. This may be because the Quiet mode reduces other sounds, making wind noise stand out more—I\'ll need to test it further. EQ Settings: The default EQ is set to Flat, but there are presets like Bass Boost, Treble Boost, and Custom, allowing you to fine-tune Low, Mid, and High frequencies to your liking. Touch Controls: You can customize Single, Double, and Triple Press, as well as Hold functions for each earbud, giving you complete control over your listening experience. Voice Control: Available in multiple languages (English, Chinese, German, French, and Spanish), you activate commands by saying ""Hey Headphones."" I had a few issues getting this to work reliably, but it might just be a learning curve. One of the standout features is Multipoint connectivity, which lets you seamlessly connect to two devices at once. Switching between my phone and computer was a breeze, which is incredibly convenient. Other useful features include Fast Mute with touch control, a remote selfie option to control your phone’s camera, and Smart Calls, allowing you to accept or reject calls, use low-latency mode for gaming or movies, and even check battery predictions for how much playtime or talk time you have left. The noise cancellation is top-notch, as expected from Bose. It’s also IPX4 water-resistant, meaning it can handle splashes and light rain—great for daily walks. The earbuds come with three sizes of silicone ear tips and stability bands to ensure a perfect fit. Battery life is solid—8.5 hours on the earbuds alone, or up to 31 hours with the charging case. Fast charging gives you 2 hours of playback with just a 20-minute charge. Overall, these 2nd-gen QuietComfort Earbuds deliver an impressive upgrade with features that rival or surpass other top brands, all while maintaining Bose’s legendary sound quality and noise cancellation. At an affordable price, these everyday earbuds are ideal for anyone, including retirees like me, who enjoy listening to music during daily walks without breaking the bank. Bose nailed it with these—Powerful, not precious, just as they promised.', 'I have struggled to find buds that fit my tiny ears without pain after an hour. I had some custom fit that were great but I could only wear them for a couple of hours. When they say ""noise canceling"" they aren\'t joking. No cap. I bought them for work because my old Bose speaker is too loud in my baking space. Unfortunately I can\'t use them at work because I can\'t hear my timers going off. They are LOUD to be heard over the music from the bakers on the other side of my ovens. Long story short - these are extremely comfortable, have great sound and just noise canceling enough to know the fire alarm is going off but still hear whatever you are listening to.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose QCE set a new standard with their exceptional noise-canceling ability, effortlessly blocking out even the most persistent background noise. The long battery life means you can enjoy uninterrupted playback throughout your day without constantly needing a charge. Designed for comfort, they fit securely and don’t budge, even during intense activity. What’s more, their significantly smaller size compared to the predecessor makes them lightweight and discreet without sacrificing sound quality. With this perfect balance of comfort, performance, and convenience, these earbuds are a top choice for any audio enthusiast.', 'The earbuds and the QCE app are pretty amazing! I was easily able to switch the noise canceling from on to off and to their third option, which is called “Awareness”. I was also able to switch between devices very smoothly and it has the option to connect to two different devices simultaneously. You can adjust the touch and voice settings easily, as well as equalizing the base and treble. Would recommend for any music lover and multiple device user.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] In regards to the Bose headphones, I found my experience rather superb. The design provides a comfortable and sturdy earpiece that won’t fall out the ear. Along with the design, the color adds that pop of unique and personal touch.', 'So I have had these earbud about a month now and they are amazing. I use to have Apple AirPods and I won’t be going back. The comfort, the light weight, the features, not feeling like the ear buds will slide out when I’m working out, and noise canceling. I like the aware mode and noise canceling mode that the earbud has. I can wear 1 earbud or both, still talk and have a conversation with someone not having to take the earbuds out and in order to block out background noise I don’t have to turn the volume up all the way saving both my hearing and the battery life. The sound is crisp sound while listening to music or gives you the movie theater feel while streaming movies. Bose made an outstanding product with these earbuds.', 'What a great product! I have owned multiple Bose Earbuds, including the QuietComfort Earbuds II and QuietComfort Ultra. The new QuietComfort Earbuds (2nd Gen) are just fantastic. This might sound odd, but they feel so light on the ears that I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Bose products always have the best sound, but I am truly impressed with the audio quality of this product. I love that it comes with an adjustable EQ on the QCE app. I listen to a lot of music, but I have also been using these earbuds to listen to podcasts and watch live TV on my phone. They are incredibly easy to connect and use. I am pleased that they come with voice commands, and I am looking forward to testing this feature more in the next few days. Additionally, these earbuds are water and sweat resistant, making them perfect for my workouts. Although I miss the Immersion feature, the Quiet and Aware modes work flawlessly. The Quiet mode is especially effective in my chatty workroom of about 40 colleagues. I often keep the earbuds on even when I’m not listening to anything, just for the noise-canceling feature, and they do not bother me at all. I use different-sized ear tips for each ear, and they fit well on my oddly-sized ears. The battery life is relentless; it just lasts forever. I think I have only charged them twice so far because of how long the battery lasts. These earbuds, at their given price point, are perfect for everyday use but still pack the punch of high-quality earbuds in terms of sound, performance, noise cancellation, and comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am a long time wearer of over ear noise cancellation headphones and always thought the noise cancelling of ear buds would never match. I was wrong. These ear buds have amazing noise cancelling abilities, just as good as the over head ones. The feature to go from quiet, aware to noise cancelling off was also very good and easy to use. The sound quality, again, was faultless. The sound quality of phone calls when outside/ in noisy environments is very good. Had no issues with any calls I made. The ability to customise the ‘touches’ to specific actions you want in the Bose App was also very good and a great idea. The accompanying app itself is good - easy to use and great way to configure your buds. I can also say they are very durable - I managed to drop the case several times (on wood and vinyl floors) and the case never split open, broke or had a scratch on it. The earbuds are the same- I feel confident that if one accidentally fell- they wouldn’t break. Comfort- their size to me is no issue, they are on the bulkier side. The sizing/ variety of their changeable buds could use improvement. I think offering smaller sizes would be beneficial. I use the smallest size on offer and could do with an even smaller size for the best fit. Despite this, they are not uncomfortable. The battery life is exceptional! Barely needed charging compared to my other devices. I would definitely recommend these to friends and family, and would definitely purchase these again in future. They are expensive, but for the noise cancellation quality- they are worth every penny.']"
iLive IAHRF79B RF Wireless Headphones with Dock,$97.68,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ilive-iahrf79b-rf-wireless-headphones-with-dock/14335494/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The iLive Wireless Radio Frequency Headphones with Charging Dock is super amazing to use, since it comes with an adjustable headband, plush, cushioned ear pads and gives me true wireless freedom to help me watch my favorite TV shows, movies and more for hours on end. This awesome headphones easily connect to my system and helps me enjoy listening to my entertainment privately. The charging dock helps me charge my headphones very easily, which I love. I love using these headphones every single day since I love the quality and crispness of sound it gives, and have already recommended it to many of my friends and family and several of them have already purchased and used it and they love the wireless freedom this headphones give them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones look very nice. It is made out of plastic but the build quality is good. The padding is decent, but the actual ear cups are shallow, so your ears press up against it. As for connectivity, the headphones connect to the base and the base needs to be connected to whatever device you use. It is inconvenient to plug in the base to a mobile device so using the headphones wired is better instead. Sound quality is decent. Overall very medium wireless headphones for videos / movies.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an okay pair of headphones. It fits well on my head and the ear pieces are nicely padded for comfort. The band portion can be adjusted as needed and is pretty comfortable as well. The base is compact and the headphones sit on it snugly for charging. The sound quality is fine for general use. I’m a bit disappointed that these are truly wireless like I would want. There is no Bluetooth capability so you can’t pair these with another device. You basically have to use one of the included cables to connect the base with another device and then use the headphones wirelessly. The only situation I would use these is in an at-home work setting but not with a TV or phone.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me start by saying, this headset has the potential to be a top contender in headsets for gamers. When it comes to fit, they don't make me feel like my head is in a vice grip or my ears are being smashed. Sound quality is superb. The controls are conveniently located for quick adjustments, this is crucial for gamers that may only have a second. However, when it comes to connectivity, there is room for improvement. Majority of households today have their TVs mounted and when trying to connect the base to their set, many will come up short. For example my TV is mounted and all of my ports are on the side, rather than the back, which creates an issue with connection. The only cord that would reach was the optical cord. While that's was fine, but now I have to turn my TV speakers on/ off whether I'm using the headset or not. While not a big deal, it can quickly become annoying. Great product for the most part, just the minor issue."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really liked the versatility of this headphone, basically it is great for home entertainment or home gym but still carry able to outdoor. It has 3.5mm jack to listen music on the go. The best part is crisp clear sound with 100 feet of range. I can easily finish more than couple of episodes with one charge and charging is easy, just place the headphone on docking station and well over an hour it ready for another session. I personally enjoy watching my favorite without disturbing my spouse in the same room. And my little one also loves this headphone.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got my RF Wireless Headphones about a month ago! They are very comfortable and inexpensive. They have soft cushion to the area where the ears set perfectly into and also have a good area of soft cushion to the area where the top of the our heads set. Both my husband and enjoy these. These are great to use when we are trying to enjoy a movie without distractions; we enjoy the movie and our kids can continue their s as activities or conversations while in the same room. It’s a win- win for us all. It has an easy to use and setup docking station. The charge on them are long lasting as well and the sound quality is amazing.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got this couple weeks ago and I have been using it almost daily. These headphones are super comfortable and have very high quality sound. No strain on the head or ears even after long use. The bluetooth connection is quite strong with the base that I can move around the house freely without worrying about losing the connection. The product came with all the connection cables that I need to connect any of my devices including optical cables. I was really impressed with how I could connect any of my audio devices with no bluetooth to the base set and listen using the wireless headset. I now have a wireless headphone for my old yamaha keyboard!! Super impressed with this headphone!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are comfortable, fold flat, and fit my large head easily. They are not bluetooth compatible, but require the provided base to be on and connected (hardwired via 3mm jack, banana plugs, or an optical cable, all provided) to a source - a receiver, in my test case to a kindle, or a computer - whatever is a stable place. The base must be plugged in for this to work, so the base is tethered, but then the headphones are wireless to the base. The headphones can also be used directly from anything that plays mp3's via the 3mm jack, but the sound quality suffers, so it's best to use them in conjunction with the base."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are good for watching television or plugging into a gaming system. If you steam a lot but don't want to disturb anyone or are a gamer with a big set-up; these work well. They are easy to connect and charge. The sound quality is pretty good and work well for multiple types of media. My only complaint is they do feel a little cheap; lightweight and a little flimsy. Also, I admittedly have a large head and these are very tight on me, even when stretched out to the maximum amount. So, not super comfortable and a little flimsy but if you need some reasonable RF headphones, these are still a decent choice."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these for my husband and I. We watcg TV late and want to be able to hear our shows without waking the kids up. These headphones are amazing. The quality is top notch and the sound is perfect.

Belkin SoundForm Flow In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - White,$49.97,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/belkin-soundform-flow-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-white/16448421/review,"['Overall good purchase except it keeps working as a pair as soon as i update the firmware 1.0.2.9 ...only oen of the earphones (right) is now able to pair with my devices while the left one stays blinking with no result. I already got it exchanged at teh place where i bought them. First time end up as two different devices so iw asnt able to pair both on the same pairing channel.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ----- SUMMARY ----- Verdict: The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds have impressed me with their active noise cancellation and “Hear-Thru” modes which both work very well. Couple that with their sleek and comfortable design, along with the great sound and mic quality, and you have a solid pair of earbuds. If you’re looking for wireless earbuds in this price range, these are definitely ones to consider. Pros: - Completely wireless - Comfortable and appealing design - Noise cancellation works well - Great sound quality - Clear phone calls - Sweat/water resistant - Good battery life Cons: - No companion app with EQ settings ----- DETAILS ----- Design & Comfort: The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds offer a completely wireless experience. Not only are the earbuds wireless, but the charging case also (with a Qi-capable charging pad). It’s convenient since I don’t have to worry about having a cable on hand. There’s a USB-C charging cable included in the box though. The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds and the case are sleek-looking and small, so they’re portable and aesthetically appealing. I’ve worn them while doing various daily tasks, including workouts, and I’ve found that they stay in my ears well and are comfortable. There are no buttons on the earbuds. Instead, touch control on each earbud allows you to play/pause songs, go to the next song or back a song, answer a call or hang up, decline a call, and activate your phone’s voice assistant. All of these are based on how many times you tap the earbud, or in some cases tap and hold for two seconds. These controls are outlined in the included quick start guide. Features & Performance: As in their name, the SOUNDFORM Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds have active noise cancellation (ANC) technology to block outside noise. I like having these earbuds with me in situations like traveling on a plane or visiting a coffee shop to get some work done. The earbuds effectively limit outside noise so that I can relax or focus. There are also situations when I want to be more aware of my surroundings, such as crossing a busy street, and that’s when the “Hear-Thru” mode comes in handy. It has the opposite effect of ANC, amplifying outside noise. Whether you're trying to limit outside noise with ANC or amplify it with “Hear-Thru”, each mode works very well. The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds are fantastic for phone calls. There’s dual beamforming technology in the earbuds that picks up your voice clearly. I’ve asked family members on calls how I sounded and they commented on the quality. I was especially impressed when I was outside walking near a busy street and they said they could still hear me clearly. The sound quality of these earbuds impressed me as well. I’d describe the sound as crisp but with a good amount of bass. You can hear the instruments clearly, and there’s a noticeable difference between the lows, mids, and highs. When I tried several music genres, they all sounded great. However, I wish there was a companion app where you could customize the EQ settings. Because they’re IPX5-rated sweat and water-resistant, the SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds can endure sweat and rain. This was an important feature to me because I wanted to use the earbuds for workouts. The sweat resistance and great sound quality have made these earbuds my new favorites for workouts. In terms of battery life, you can expect about 31 hours, which is true to what Belkin advertises. The earbuds provide about 7 hours, and the case provides an additional 24 hours of power. ----- WHAT’S IN THE BOX ----- 1 x SOUNDFORM Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds 1 x Qi Charging Case 3 x Pairs Silicone Ear Tips 1 x USB-C Charging Cable 1 x Quick Start Guide"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wanted to get new bluetooth earbuds because I want to go workout but I don't want to have cable. These are absolutely beautiful. The sound quality is outstanding and the design is very sleek and modern. They fit very well to my ear and even when I'm working out, running and jumping they stay at place and doesn't move or fall out of my ear. I really like the white color and the way how they look. The noise canceling function works perfect so you can easily hear your music in loud back round. I would definitely recommend these earbuds! It's great product."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The SoundForm Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds are amazing quality at a great price. The case they come in is very user friendly and stylish. The earbuds are true in the fact, they cancel out surrounding noise very well. The sound quality is top of the line and has great bass. I love the fact that a quick 10 minute charge gives me an hour or more of playtime. They are water resistant which is a must for great buds. They do come with a charge cable and different size cushions. These earbuds are quite durable and have such great performance. I highly recommend these earbuds for casual listening and active users alike.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds really are noise cancelling. I tried them during a kids’ party near my house and I was able to work peacefully with some music. I appreciate the earbuds come in multiple colors, including black to match my phone case. The earbuds also come with additional ear tips in three sizes. I have small ears and have trouble keeping wireless earbuds in my ears comfortable. I used the small size and the fit great and were comfortable. I prefer the soft ear tips for comfort compared to other earbud options without. I tried these during a work out and they only fell out once, which I felt was a win. I still worry about loosing them, but can definitely say these fit better. The box comes with charging cable (but not plug adapter) so you can plug them in a computer or use your own usb plug adapter. The part I liked best is that you can actually use a wireless charger and place a case right on the charging pad. The charging indicator light is also helpful to know how charged the earbuds are with 3 settings 100%-75% is white, 50% is orange, and <25% is red. They were really easy to connect to my phone and tablet. I think these earbuds are a great option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall I thought these headphones were nice and good quality. They remind me a lot of the Apple Airpods but I find these to be more comfortable with the inner ear piece. They connected to my phone very easily and was able to start listening to them from opening the box to music playing in my ears in less than 5 minutes. Two small things that I found that could be improved was that the case closes easily after opening. It needs to be fully open in order to stay open and if touched will close. Additionally, when changing from ANC to having other sounds, it only beeps. I wish it would tell you which mode you were in to make it obvious.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have tried a few different pairs of wireless earbuds and these win in terms of sound quality and call quality. My friend said he didn't realize I was on a walk outside because the audio was so crisp and clear. The earbuds come with 3 different sizes of ear tips you can find the perfect fit, which will help with noise cancellation. The product is well made and even has Active Noise Cancellation, which is a feature you typically find in higher end headphones. As this is a new product, there is some clear room for improvement, but none of these things are dealbreakers: - The headphones offer 3 modes of noise cancellation: off, passthrough, and ANC. However, when you switch between these three modes by tapping your finger on the left earbud, you hear a sound effect to indicate that you have switched modes. The problem is, you don't actually know what mode you've switched to as it doesn't say. - The earbuds do not have a companion app unlike some other Belkin earbuds, which means you cannot adjust EQ settings, see the current noise cancellation mode, or even see the battery level of the charging case. While there are different coloured LED lights on the case and earbuds themselves to indicate charge level, I am colourblind and cannot tell the difference between the green and orange lights. Overall, these are fantastic earbuds for the price and the addition of ANC is a welcome feature! Best of all, they sound fantastic on calls and I had no complaints when I was on the phone with my friends."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These noise cancelling headphones lived up to my expectations! The quality of sound is amazing! They come with 3 different earbud sizing, small, medium and large. The small fit me best, leaving the earbuds snug in my ear. I love the charging case. They case stayed charged for at-least a day and the headphone charged very quickly (roughly 10 mins for at-least a 60/min). After each use I place them back in their case so they’re all charged for my next workout! They’re lightweight, easy to use, and very well made! They’ve held up extremely well while sweating at the gym as well! I love these headphones and overall extremely please with the sound quality and durability!', ""Each ear bud is connecting independently to any phone I connect to. I can't listen to music with both ear buds at the same time. This is very frustrating. I was hoping for a firmware update that might resolve this, but none have been released since February 2024. I reached out to support, and was asked to replace my earbuds. However, I bought the ear buds in a duty free shop and I can't replace them at that store since it's in another country."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These seem to be a solidly build pair of wireless ear buds with quality materials. The part that fits in my ear fits comfortably and stays comfortable for multiple hours. They were easy to set up and I had them ready to go within a few minutes. I have so far used these for about 6 hours in a row and had to problem with holding a charge that long. The sound quality is nice, but the part where I'd say these ear buds excel is their noise canceling. These are a nice set of ear buds that hold up to your needs.""]"

I haven\'t tested the battery life yet, but have been great on my shorter runs (longest I\'ve gone so far is just 3.5 miles) and there was still quite a bit of charge left.

I have a job that requires me to hear the things around me and especially a walkie talkie which gives me tasks to complete. The radio in my tractor is too loud for that but these are the perfect workaround with amazing battery life. I love the pause button location. Only complaint is that when I press pause, it takes a second or two for my music/podcast to actually pause. Otherwise, these headphones are super legit and an absolute gamechanger for workers.', 'Hello, I ordered OpenRun Pro mini and It wouldn’t turn on and I couldn’t figure out how to get them on my head. So, you guys kindly sent me a new set, but they do not say pro and they were not mini. Please tell me how I can get the correct ones?', ""I am absolutely loving these headphones. Nothing goes inside my ear but I get a full surround sound audio with peak quality. They sit extremely comfortably and I haven't had to touch them once while working out. I only have two minor complaints. First, if I'm near anything loud (traffic, construction, etc.) the sound is drowned out very easily and I have to turn it up to max volume to hear semi-decently. It's not a huge issue but I'd love to see it improved upon. Second, a charging case would go a long way. The battery life is really good but if it runs low while I'm out and about it'd be nice to conveniently charge my headphones on the go."", ""I love these headphones!

The previous OpenRun Pro were waterproof enough where I could listen to them in the shower as long as I wasn't washing my hair. If a single drop of water gets on the bottom of this latest pair, sound quality goes fuzzy. No worries, though. Besides that, I'm still in love with these.""]"
Corsair HS80 Max Wireless Gaming Headset - Steel Grey,$189.98,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/corsair-hs80-max-wireless-gaming-headset-steel-grey/17905035/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far, I am loving the gaming headphones! It feels like you are in the game! I can play for hours without it hurting my head so that’s a plus!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about this headset feels just right to me. The build quality is what I would expect at this price point, the buttons and wheels are firm without any play, and the comfort and balance are incredible. This is arguably the best set I have on my desk now, and I intend to get a lot of use out of these. However, I didn’t come to this conclusion without encountering a few snags. This was not a plug-and-play experience for me. Your mileage may vary, but a firmware and software update were needed for me to establish any sort of audio connection. Setting up SoundID by reducing tones to the point where they're barely audible in each ear is a bit cumbersome, but the results are worth it. This headset does not come with access to the Windows Dolby Atmos App; however, if you already have this feature, you can and should sort out those settings as well. It makes a significant difference when Dolby Atmos audio is available. I do wish that active noise cancellation was an option for this set at this price point. I could also make a point about the absence of a case to go with it. But I will gladly prioritize improved build quality and durability over potentially poor-performing ANC or a case I would seldom use on the go anyway. I love this addition to my setup, and I'm delighted to have my hands on a set of headphones that I'm confident I'll be using for a while."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I prefer a quality, over the ear headset, over any other style headphones, so when I had the opportunity to pick up the new HS80 Max Wireless headset from Corsair, I was excited to try it out.  In the box are the headphones, USB dongle, charging cable, and paperwork.  Setup is easy, for the PC plug in the USB dongle and press the power button on the headset. Same steps for the PlayStation however you then need to go change the output setting to ""all audio"". I have used this headset with my laptop for work, a desktop and a PS4 for gaming, as well as connected via Bluetooth to my Android phone for calls and music.    As for controls the left ear has the microphone with led indicator, power button, volume / EQ / iCue software control roller (roller is programmable via iCue for press function) control, status LED, and charging port.  On the right ear is the bluetooth / multi function button. When in the up position, or muted, the microphone LED will turn red to indicate mute, otherwise white (or custom color) to indicate it\'s live, with controllable RGB LEDs on the outside of each ear cup.  I really like the build, especially the floating headband, meaning that the top of my head doesn\'t experience pressure and I can wear it comfortably all day long.  The memory foam ear cups are plush enough to be comfortable but stay in place fairly well.  My only negative is that this is one of the heavier headsets I\'ve used.  At 13 ounces, it\'s double the weight of my normal headset, and after a full day of wear, I can tell the difference. The upside to this weight is that the ear cups house 50 mm high-density neodymium drivers to deliver impressive sound quality, range, and depth. I find the sound nuances are most apparent when gaming, as the background environment sounds seamless, not overdriven or muted. As for PC based gaming, music, and movies, the ability to leverage Dolby Atmos multi dimensional sound really makes a difference for an overall immersive experience.  As for other features, the battery and range performance is what I consider good, meaning that I can travel at least 50\' from the dongle without losing connectivity, the battery lasts for at least 10 hours through all day meetings and then still has power for after work gaming or streaming.  On an average work day I only use about 15 - 20% battery total.  To expand options for LED light customization, EQ settings, audio profile presets, firmware updates and programmable buttons, you\'ll need to download the iCue software.  The iCue software isn\'t necessary, but it allows the flexibility to customize your EQ settings and get the most out of the headset.  Other features of the iCue software include button function assignments, lighting effects, equalizer presets and custom settings, SoundID Personalization - a five minute test to tailor the audio settings to your preferences, and then overall device settings, see photos. Overall, I would detract half of a star due to the weight, but honestly that\'s my only complaint about this headset, and the build is still comfortable enough to wear all day, so I\'ll stick with the full five stars. It\'s a great versatile headset, but really shines for crisp, nuanced, audio.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair HS80 Max is a solid mid-tier gaming headset with excellent Dolby Atmos integration. Sonically, the HS80s sound fantastic for a gaming headset which handily competes with my more expensive musical wireless headphones. The headset is a combination of high-quality metal parts and premium plastic parts. The ear cups covers are woven fabric over memory foam. The ear holes are spacious for my ears and deep enough that my ears do not touch the drivers. The RGB is confined to the Corsair logo on both ear cups. The boom mic flips out of the way and will auto activate dependent on the up/down position. There is an LED band just below the mic to indicate Mute (red) and Active, (white). The head band leverages Velcro straps for adjustments. And the ear cups swivel allowing them to be turned inwards on your collar when wearing the headset around your neck. iCUE is packed with features that really take this headset to that next level allowing you to leverage Dolby Atmos, Nvidia Broadcast, and other sonic features unique to Corsair. Overall, if you are looking for an all-around solid gaming headset with fantastic Dolby Atmos implementation then I encourage you to audition these. Sonic performance: Gaming headsets, in general, get the job done if your only use case is gaming. Few gaming headsets I have owned have the chops to compete with dedicated musical headsets when it comes maximizing the sonic enjoyment of cut scenes, intro music, or even some of the more nuanced audio cues that developers put into games to add ambiance and emotion. The HS80 Max does a wonderful job of delivering both heartiest base notes to the long, nuanced decay of a piano string. I started my HS80 Max journey with classical piano. Strange, right? If headphones, or a speaker, struggles with piano then go look for another speaker. The classical pieces I auditioned on the HS80 Max were expansive, expressive, dynamic, and the decay time for singular piano notes was impressive. Corsair did a good job designing a well-behaved and balanced speaker. Why is this important? Let’s consider Halo Infinite’s cinematic cut scenes. Sonically, the cutscenes are Hollywood blockbuster movie quality. The in-game music is cinema quality. Now imagine a 5.1 surround sound system on your head. Now imagine adding Dolby Atmos positional sound processing to not only the cut scenes but to the game world at large without losing any fidelity. And trust me, with all that’s going on, the headset has enough headroom to hit those large explosions. In my opinion, Corsair nailed it here. Let’s get specific about Dolby Atmos for a minute. First, you must download the Dolby Access app from the Microsoft Store. Then, you must explicitly set spatial sound to Dolby Atmos. See included screenshot. The Dolby Access Atmos demo videos were impressive and did an excellent job of demonstrating how well the HS80’s integrate with Atmos. One game in particular embraced Dolby Atmos unlike any other. Forza Horizon 5. My first real experience with Atmos was driving through an in-game thunderstorm. Thunder and rain were literally all around me. Sonically, it was not as realistic as actually being in a thunderstorm. But the virtual space was well controlled and convincing. Next, I ran a 20-lap race whose virtual space included a grandstand and cheering fans all around the track. The grandstand had a speaker system that played the in-game music for that track on an infinite loop. The music approached my right ear as I approached the grandstand. The music was at its loudest as I drove by the grandstand and predominantly in my right ear. Then finally fading away, a bit, as I drove away. It never fully faded away simply because it was part of the race’s background sound. Same thing with the cheering fans. The sounds got louder as I approached them and diminished into obscurity as I drove past them and away. And, like the grandstand speaker system, the crowd noise panned around the virtual sonic field relative to my position on the track. Simply put, this is the best I have heard positional audio with any gaming headset I own. Overall, I am impressed with the sonic prowess of the HS80 Max. Comfort: Comfort is a bit of a miss for me. First, the ear cups, though made of memory foam, are a bit stiff or my liking. For me, they put too much pressure above my ears and close enough to my jaw joint that it bothers my TMJ. This limits my usage to about two hours before I need to take a break. The fabric cover is soft, comfortable, and should offer increased durability over foe leather covers. If Corsair offered a plusher foe leather alternative, then I would snatch those up in a heartbeat. Second, the HS80 comes in at .717 lbs. My typical go to headset comes in at .55 lbs. The extra weight is noticeable for me. It does contribute to my two-hour wear limit. The head band is adjustable but is not telescoping. The underside of the headband has two Velcro strips where the adjustable strap connects to the headband. The quick start guide, located on Corsairs Support site, does not provide any guidance on how the headband works. The ends of the adjustable strap are attached to the underside of the headband. There is a little metal tab that will allow you to pull the strap away from the Velcro. Once adjusted correctly, the strap did a good job of keeping the headband in place. It is not the most accurate or efficient system I have seen but it gets the job done. iCUE: The HS80 Max is not an RGB powerhouse. That’s a good thing in my opinion. Not all gaming gear needs a robust RGB light show. If you are familiar with iCUE then you will be pleased to know that you can customize the HS80 Max to all your gaming profiles. I think this is most important for those instances where you are leveraging custom EQ settings for different genres of games or entertainment such as movies and music. This is also where you can integrate Nvidia Broadcast. I did not test Nvidia Broadcast because I did not need any of the AI powered tools that Nvidia provides. My friends on Discord reported that my voice was broadcast quality during our gaming sessions. That’s good enough for me. As a side note, the mic boom is flexible. In addition to the custom EQ settings, iCUE includes SoundID Personalization. Essentially, this is a five-minute hearing test for each ear to determine the optimum EQ for each earcup. This is an interactive test leveraging test tones at different frequencies. The test will provide a graph showing how each ear responded to the test tones. Rejoice if you tested with perfect hearing. Unfortunately, I discovered that my hearing sensitivity is below 15khz. Boo. The good news is that this mode creates a custom EQ for each ear to maximize sound quality for each ear. Essentially, this is room correction applied directly to your ears as opposed to applying it to your room. The downside is that you cannot combine any of these technologies. You can use present EQ or customer EQ, SoundID, or Dolby Atmos but not in combination with each other. Again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. It just is. Finally, I would like to see an adjustable default volume slider in iCUE for this headset. My headset defaults to 100% volume in with every application across three separate computers. I had to go into Windows Sound and turn every program down to 2 on their individual volume sliders just so I had some volume headroom. Otherwise, I’m blasting myself out of my earcups. This is not necessarily a con because there is a workaround. It just means that I have to mindful and pro-actively adjust windows volume as I add new games and applications to the system. What I did not like: The multi-function button could have been designed with some sound damping. The MFB is used to pause video or music. However, the click sounds cheap, loud, and echoes in the earcup. Second, I would like control to dim the microphone light. When in the upright position, the light is right next to my eye. When down, the white light is just inside my peripheral vision which creates some glare off my cheek and my glasses. I would like to see an option in iCUE that allows me to dim and disable the lights. Third, instructions. I understand that printed manuals are an added cost that could be better spent on improving the product. And it reduces material from the waste stream. However, Corsair could have included a QR code in the box that points to a quick setup guide, user’s manual, or even an FAQ. iCUE could also be updated to include links to product documentation. During setup, I spent more time than I should have on basic activities that the Quick Start guide covers in detail. Final thoughts: Sonically, the HS80 Max is fantastic. Comfort, for me, was a bit of an issue. Overall, the HS80 Max is a solid headset, has a great feature set, and iCUE integrated features elevate the experience to that next level. A 10-point Equalizer, preset EQs, and SoundID add a level of flexibility that higher priced gaming and dedicated wireless musical headsets lack. The implementation of Dolby Atmos on the HS80s alone is reason enough for me to recommend these headphones. The cons I listed are mostly subjective. There are a few items I hope Corsair addresses through iCUE. Overall, I think the HS80 Max is a rock-solid mid-level gaming headset that will provide any gamer with an exceptional sonic experience.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] CORSAIR HS80 MAX WIRELESS Summary: Comfortable fit, epic sound quality, and wireless! Pros: * Epic sound quality. This unit has great sound and a nice deep base. I can listen to dance music or play games and truly enjoy the sound. * Svelte design. The design looks pretty sweet. They aren't overengineered. The plastic enclosures and fittings all look metallic, and the weight fools you into thinking it might be. * Just enough LEDs. A power LED, a microphone status LED, and a product LED - that's all you need. The power LED is subtle and located on the back of the unit near the controls. The Corsair logo is lit which is a nice touch and is just bright enough to almost mistake it for a sticker/plastic during the day. * Comfortable. I generally don't like headsets. I own a few. But I don't like wearing them. This unit is comfortable, and the adjustable head strap helps you tweak how the unit rests on your head. The ear padding is just great and fits my ears just fine. * Controls. There are three controls: power, volume, and a Bluetooth pairing button. * USB-C. Thank you. One less charger and cable to worry about. This unit uses USB-C to charge - which is great! * Simply and sexy microphone boom. The boom turns the mic on or off. When it is on, there is a band along the bottom that lights white. When it is off, it is red. Cons: * I can't think of any cons. But I will say that I notice my ears get awfully warm. This happens with all headsets. Though, I have used ones with passive cooling. That would have been a nice touch for this unit. Use: I use this for gaming when I want to be quiet in the home, and I use it a lot for meetings. I have the standard mic and speaker setup, but a headset makes the meeting quainter, and it cancels out noise in the background so I can hear the participants. I definitely recommend this headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had the HS80 wired before, I though the wired version was the same minus wireless functionality. I Was wrong. The perks you get with the MAX version are by far the best among all the versions. The best one is SoundID, which creates a profile based on your own hearing (See that everyone has a diferent interpretation of what we hear). You just follow the instructions on the ICUE software and your listening experience will be enhacnced', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Extremely disappointed in these headphones. Purchased a pair and liked them initially despite some confusion on how to get them to charge, the dongle and the headphones have to be plugged in at the same time, and how to switch between the dongle and bluetooth modes. I very quickly realized they had connectivity issues and would randomly cut connection to the dongle at times. Along with the plastic covering for the hinges being the most un-sturdy material known to man kind. Within one month both hinge covers had cracked off, I contacted Corsair support and got them replaced. Less than a month after that, the hinge covers on the replacement cracked off. Will not be purchasing again.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This review was done on a Windows PC. Out of the box you get the headset and a USB charging cable. The HS80 Max gets a lot right, and one minor thing wrong. The build of the headset is pretty nice. The earpads are a nice fabric. This is quite comfortable. The downside is that my ears got pretty warm after about 30 mintues of use. The fabric also attracts a lot of debris. There's a band that helps with the comfort. The earpads rotate so they can sit flat on your chest when not in use. You have two options in regards to the functionality. You can use the USB dongle. Your PC will detect it and if it needs any drivers, it'll automatially download it. The other way is to connect it via bluetooth. You simply press the bluetooth pairing button and then pair to your pc and you're done. I use the bluetooth method as it saves a USB slot. You'll want to donwload the Dolby app. Once you set Dolby Atmos, you'll see a big difference and experience awesome surround sound. I watched a movie and loved the total surround sound that the headset provided. I felt immeresed in the action with the loud explosions and subtle sounds. The gaming experience was just as awesome. When playing a FPS, you can hear ambient noise as well as specific noises from specific directions. One minor gripe is that the mic doesn't come off. It rests in a vertical position when not in use, but the fact that you can't remove it makes it less incognito when using it out in public. All in all Corsair has set a high bar with comfort and sound."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had been swapping my headset back and forth between my console and PC for some time, however I had gotten some feedback in the past for it being very quiet while using it on my PC. I started looking in to headsets but wanted to continue using a wireless headset as I like to be able to move around between in game activities. The headset came snug in the box, no real plastics on it, just some cling in a couple area to avoid scratches. In the packaging you get the headset, Wireless USB dongle, a USB C Cable and small warranty and safety manuals. There is a QR code in the box for the product manual. The headset has some adjustments, there is a strap that you can adjust using held in place by some velcro, and you move the Mic up to turn off the Mic and down to turn on. There is an audio prompt to let you know the mic is on or off when you move it in to a position. Out of the box, the headset isn't really tuned. Before getting in to a gaming session, you are going to want to download the Corsair iCue software and run through the SoundID for yourself. This will play various tones, at a time between you left and right ear. You adjust the tone for the left, then it repeats for the right and you go through this until you get to the next section you will select a preferred song out of a list, and you run through an audio test similar to an eye test, which sounds better to you A or B. Once done you will have an audio profile set for you, and gaming and music has been wonderful with this! If you have any complaints about the sound, run through this test before judging. I haven't played much competitive outside of some crucible in Destiny 2, I have mostly been on Remnant 2 and Diablo IV at the moment. The audio has been fantastic and have no complaints. The Mic is pretty sensitive outside the box, I did install the Nvidia plugin for the headset, and once I adjust the sensitivity, I have not had any complaints of being quiet, compared to my experience with my previous headset. Just be sure to adjust this slowly as you can get LOUD! There is some RGB, on the sides in the Corsair symbols and on the end of the mic to show the status. I just set a static color, but you can't really see it so I don't think much about it. There is Bluetooth built in also, you can toggle between modes, I have paired it with my phone, but mostly just use the headset for gaming. The headset is very comfortable though so if I needed over the ear headphones on the go, I wouldn't be against using them. Overall no complaints at this time, this is a wonderful headset and fits the bill of what I was looking for! I don't tend to charge things out of the box, this got me through a couple sessions before needing to charge. I charged it for a short period of time, and it got me through another night. I am giving it a full charge, however if the 15-20 minutes if charge I gave it is anything to go off of, this should last through a few long sessions, plus be comfortable enough to get you through it as well!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair HS80 Max is a good and comfortable headset. I was going to give it 4 stars but raised it to 5 after a firmware upgrade fixed some issues I was having. I tested it on a PC which allowed to use Dolby Atmos. Make sure you upgrade the firmware for the receiver and headset first thing. In the box is the headset and a receiver specifically for it. The manual can be found be scanning a QR link in the package which takes you to the Corsair webpage for it. On the left ear are the microphone, volume, and power/connection type button. On the right ear is a Bluetooth button (BT). The headset isn't to heavy, and is comfortable. The ear-cups have a good amount of cushion on them and can be worn for a while without discomfort. The headset is plastic and has a rechargable battery rated for 24-130 hours depending on the connection type and if the RGB lights are used. For lights, the corsair light emblem is on both sides and the microphone has a light to indicate status. Out of the box you can connect the headset with the included receiver, or connect via BT. The receiver is plug and play, while BT is a standard search and connect. The receiver blinks red when disconnected and stays a solid white when connected to the headset. Once connected voice prompts will give changes in status. The mic has a flexible boom and will stay in position once you bend it to the desired shape. When the mic is down its light is blue, and when you move it up, it changes to red and automatically mutes the mic. Pressing the power button quickly will switch the headset connection from the receiver to BT. In either mode you have access to all the features of the headset. I loaded the Corsair iCue which gives you more control over the headset, lights, microphone boost etc, and is an easy way to upgrade the firmware on both devices. When upgrading the headset is supposed to be connected directly to the computer, no dongle/hub. I could not get the upgrade to work with a dongle/hub as stated. The included charging cable for the headset is a USB-A to USB-C cable. My computer only had USB-C ports. I used a USB-C to USB-C cable and had no problems upgrading the headset. The sound for the headset falls into two categories. For music it was good. Music sounded decent and was pleasant to listen too, nothing really stood out about it, but all genres of music sounded good. But, it’s for games and it really stepped up in them. Using the Dolby PC app, the surround sound from Atmos was quite nice. In Atmos surround demos you can hear the sound circle your head and come from different directions including height. The presence of the channels is represented well. This translated well into various games. I can play without disturbing others since my speakers are off. I didn’t have any problems with the mic, on Discord and other apps my voice came through fine once I set it up properly in the programs. Just shift up the boom to mute. For games the sound is wonderful and for music it’s average, but good enough to listen too between games. I’d say the receiver seems to have better emphasis than when it uses the receiver compared to BT mode, but not by much. Overall, the HS80 Max is a good headset. The sound is great in games and emulates surround sound well. It’s not heavy and comfortable. A solid headset whether using BT or the included receiver. I walked around out of my room and for a good 20-30 ft had no issues with the sound or mic. Just make sure you upgrade the firmware when you get it.""]"

It seems comfy and is light. Can't say anything on the sound quality. The reason for the loss of stars is because the screws that connect the ear cup to headband keep falling out, making the headphone fall apart! Questionable build quality."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is, by far, the best headset we’ve ever had. It surpasses the Nova 5, 7 and Pro. The sound quality and profile for the price point is far beyond anything I could have predicted. Now, would I buy these for listening to music solely? No. But I’d listen to music with them now and then. They’re a bit base heavy and the treble is blah, so I wouldn’t use them for that, but they’re good for gaming. You can hear footsteps in games and they fit the ears well. On that note, let’s discuss comfort. These are COMFORTABLE. Comfortable for me and my kids. That’s hard to find in a single headset. They ear cups and adjustable headband blew me away. The ear cups lay flat (they call them fold-flat) against the head and neck when not in use. We love that the mic is fully retractable and that the cable is detachable. I like that there’s a separate cable for PC hookup as well. Such a versatile headset in so many ways. You can’t go wrong with this steelseries Arctis Nova 1 headset.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are looking for good and functional headphones then yes this is the one for gaming purpose.

Ease and comfort of using for hours at a stretch.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The value of these headphones are on real! The surround sound as well as the high volume makes for insane clarity as well as good bass. Don’t get me started on the microphone! I have an $200 mic yet it still compete’s with it. And the topper of the cake has to be the software, insane flexibility as well as control with sound of headset as well as mic! Overall would totally recommend for a budget to mid range setup!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great budget headset for gaming especially if you have a USB sound card or amp.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve used these on both my PC for zoom meetings and with my PS4. The outer portion of the headphones is plastic making them lightweight. At this price point, I’d expect plastic. The mic sound quality was pretty good too. My friends say they can hear me perfectly without any static or noise distortion. The mic is removable, which is nice for when I’m playing a solo game. The sound quality of gaming and zoom were quite surprisingly good. I’m no audiophile but I do know when something sound good (but not amazing). I’m not going to be thumping hip hop bass with these things but for gaming they’re great at this price point.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great for the price I got it for - sound cancelling and comfort is surprisingly good, which I didn’t expect, given how inexpensive it was. Sound comes through excellently, and folks on discord say I no longer sound like a monster (using old Logitech mic before). I have only had it for a month so I can’t say how good wear and tear will be, but the strap design on the top helps me to know it’s going to last longer than the flakey pleather runner ups I’ve used in the past. It’s secure and of a good material. Only reason I give it a 4/5 is that I wish it was a swing boom mic, because sometimes I’m fumbling trying to align the mic just-so, to store it away into its slot.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Really comfortable and great sound for 53$ I paid with steel series website price match. If you don't realize it the headband extends were the ear cups are attached to make the headset bigger. I've seen a few reviews where people don't realize this and say the headsets too small. It's extremely comfortable in lightweight and sounds great. These are a clear upgrade from the arctis 1 they replace in the product line.""]"

They worked well, but after a while, the plastic coating on the wires wore off in a certain place, causing them to become exposed and bent/broken, which meant they would just stop functioning at all. I'm pretty sure this happened after the warranty expired. Womp womp. Oh and the interchangeable soft tips of earbuds are cool and actually super comfortable! Loved that. They do have a tendency to slip off of the place where they click in sometimes, though. Hope that makes sense. It's late and the terminology eludes me. I'd recommend getting something with a better warranty, though."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Buying earbuds is an arduous process for me, as my ears are apparently weird mutant models. In this case, the buds were great at reducing noise and producing clear sound, but even with the smallest buds, they hurt my ears and gave me headaches after a short while. I'm not sure if that's due to the vacuum-like seal they produce in the ear canal or if my ears are just too darned weird for these particular devices. Regardless, I am certain what made these buds fail for me is less a product design issue than a personal issue, which will explain why I didn't give these a 1-star review. If you have particularly sensitive ears, these are probably not the best option for you. Me? I'll go back to the classic gummies."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm rough on headphones. I listen to podcasts on my commute and doing household chores to the tune of probably 20 hours per week.

They isolate the noise very well. No signs of the wires failing from being tugged or caught too many times yet. Because they fit my ears pretty well, I don't need the volume as high either, which I assume is good for my smartphone battery life."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first put these in I thought they were very comfortable and the 3 different sizes make it very easy to fit to your ear.

The Transparency mode is equally impressive, allowing me to stay connected with my surroundings when needed, making it safer for outdoor activities or engaging in conversations without removing the earbuds. Comfort is another area where the AirPods Pro excel. With their innovative and ergonomic design, they fit snugly and securely in my ears, providing a comfortable and stable fit even during extended listening sessions. The included silicone ear tips in three sizes ensure a personalized fit, enhancing both comfort and sound isolation. I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort, making them perfect for long flights, workouts, or daily commutes.']"

Totally and completely awesome. They also seem extremely well constructed and due to last a long time."", ""I am now on my 4th pair of these things. (Having been RMA'd three times now) Every 2-3 months one ears driver or the other will just randomly stop working. (Verified by changing cables, switching the right and left side cables, checking against different amps). The headphones sit at my work desk and are not repeatedly plugged in or out and so there's no reason this should be happening. I'm using the Monotprice 11567 driver to drive them. Thankfully Monorpice's RMA process is relatively painless but this isn't the kind of experience you should expect with these headphones. :("", ""I bought these to see how closed-back planar magnetic headphones compared to the open-back Monolith M1060 and the HIFIMAN HE400s cans I already owned. I instantly loved them! While I enjoy the sound stage and crispness of the 'M1060s (a better deal than the 'HE400s IMHO), the '565Cs provide more punch in the bass frequencies without sacrificing any clarity. They're also pretty easy to drive, though I think they benefit from a dedicated amp. Now, I picked them up on sale, which may have added to my enthusiasm about the price, but they're a great deal, regardless. I'm not surprised that TheWirecutter website lists them as they're top-recommended planar magnetic headphones (at time of this writing, which is June 25 2020)."", 'I was very skeptical when i purchased these cans that are very cheap for planars. Pleased so far with their Very smooth sound with tight bass. Bass is not over blown but clear and tight. Picks up very low bass notes nicely. Highs and mids detailed and sweet. I am able to drive them fairly well with my Android phone. Better sound with headphone output from both of my 2 stereo preamps. I will be purchasing a headphone amp and dac which should improve things even more. Build quality seems fine with detachable cable. SURPRISINGLY Comfortable to wear.', 'I wanted to get some very high quality listening experiences so I decided to purchase higher end stuff, and in that mix I wanted some planar magnetic headphones. I was very disappointed. These sound absolutely awful in a dierct headphone jack situation. They sound like the garbage PC desk speakers from old time prebuild computer days. The case is nice, the build is nice, they look nice, and the adjustability is awesome for smaller heads and comfort. But none of that matters when they sound so bad out of the box. Even after testing them all day and into the night, they sound awful compared to even my skullcandy slyr. These will not work for any direct listening situation. I would love to see this style and features with normal 50m drivers. This design is fantastic for wearability.', 'Very private world as I prefer when enjoying Classical Symphony through a Monolith 124460 Portable Headphone Amplifier and Dac from my late 2016 Mac Book Pro with just a mild touch-up of bass and upper frequencies. The amp can drive the phones to ear hurtful levels totally contained by the closed back so let timid caution be your guide. I like the heft to an extent as once they\'re parked they stay put. Ear holes snuggle right to the edges to perfectly present program. and counter any drift. I notice a slight sound quality improvement from out of the box through initial break in so patience will reward. My phones came with an almost ebony finish with very little discernible grain. Rather pleasing however I don\'t listen to them while vainly gazing at a mirror. Summing up. ""A heck of a deal, highly recommend.""', 'Very happy with the McustomertM565C. Was looking for a wood closed back at a reasonable price. . Beautiful design- industrial chic I call it. Sound is solid and balanced. Bass is there, just not dominating. Mid and high present nice warm sounds. I leave both cables plugged in. Most people have access to a label maker. I printed an R and L , no problem whatsoever. I have six quality headphones, all good in their own way, but the M565C has quickly become a favorite.', ""I think they are probably wonderful but I can't make them work! I know other people who have used them successfully but sadly I am not one of them. They are very impressive looking and actually not as heavy as they look but they are not easy to position - they keep twisting around is not easy to get them into the right position. I suppose I can get used to that with a little practice but the real issue is truly making them work. I plugged them into my computer in what was clearly the correct spot but I never got any sound. There was no instruction included with the headphones it was entirely guess work on my part. So what I need now is clear and accurate instruction. And please do NOT ask me if they were connected in all the right places - they were correctly connected over and over again until I had to give up and get on with my life. So please fix it. Thanks."", 'surprisingly satisfying. I love these for their heft and subtle cherrywood-esque accents on the cans. The sound quality is worth every penny. I also appreciate that these headphones make me look unapporoachable. Their look clearly implies that I expect my headphones to be saying something more interested in what my headphones have to say.', 'They look good, and fit really well. Not too heavy, and don’t give me a headache if I wear them for hours. The sound quality is great. The audio cable is lightweight, sturdy, and detachable.

The headset and base station pair together just fine and I can use the headset but the Audio Hub V2 doesn\'t recognize the headset no matter what I do, happens on both my laptop and my desktop definitely a software issue as I\'ve also exchanged the headset to see if it was just defective but to no avail. I\'ve also even pushed the ""reset"" button on the bottom of the base, this does basically nothing but I guess ""reset"" the power and turns back on.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Turtle Beach Stealth Pro! TLDR - great comfy wireless headset with swappable batteries. Now to the details. I primarily use Astro A40s and A50s as my main pair of cans, so trying out the Stealth Pros for the first time was quite interesting. In terms of audio quality, the Stealth Pros were definitely on par with the A40s/A50s. Directional audio was very precise and i did not notice any lag when playing FPS games. In terms of build quality, i feel like it's as premium, if not more than my A50s. There is quite a heft to it though, so that may factor into fatigue for long gaming sessions (which i have not yet experienced but your mileage may vary). The design choice of the Stealth Pros is quite nice in my opinion but that is a pretty subjective area. In terms of comfort, right off the bat the Stealth Pros have quite higher clamping force than my A40s/A50s and this is due to the headphones Noise Cancellation feature. I personally do not like Noise Cancellation as it creates an atmosphere within my ears that is jarring, so i left it off. Additionally, to help with easing up the clamp force a bit, i placed my Stealth Pros on a yoga block to relieve some of the clamp tension. After one night of this, the comfort level of the Stealth Pros were defintely on par with my A40s/A50s and i was a happy camper, pun intended :P One of the best features of this headset is the swappable batteries! I can't tell you how many times i forget to charge my headphones and have to wait for it to get charged in order to play. With my A50s, i usually hang them right on the edge of my desk after gaming sessions, and when I need them again they're usually low on battery or dead. Well, with the Stealth Pros i definitely didn't have anymore of those worries as the batteries here are swappable. I just can't believe this hasn't been a feature other premium brands haven't thought of before or began adopting yet... Truly a game changer! The last bit of detail i have left for the Stealth Pros is the microphone. For sure my friends hear me better with the A40s/A50s, and the clarity and depth of the Stealth Pros were not far behind. It wasn't bad, but if i had to nitpick about something, the microphone could be the only thing. In terms of settings up, it's pretty intuitive and straightforward. No hassles really, i got my Stealth Pros up and running with a couple of minutes after unboxing it. Using it on my Xbox X & PC and i didn't really experience any issues. The Stealth Pros also come with high quality cables for connecting the receiver battery dock combo, so big kudos to Turtle Beach for that. Overall, i would highly recommend this for anyone that is truly looking for a premium experience when gaming."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Turtle Bay really pulled out the stops for this one. Including quality materials and construction, great sound and a slew of features that add worthwhile functionality to gameplay. Where to start? There’s plenty to love: active noise cancelling, tweak-able everything, a companion app that actually works and looks great. Flip up mic to mute, swappable batteries, etc. Construction: The headset has a nice heft to it and nice features throughout. The batteries feel easy to swap thanks to the magnetic cover and simple clip fastening. They pop in and out with ease and are always at the ready with one always charging in the included transmitter. I appreciate the metal loop incorporated in the ear cups too. Plenty of other headsets use painted plastic here, but it always ends up feeling like a cheap imposter. The rotation and pivot hinges are also strong and unlikely to pose any issue over time. The only areas I’d point out as possible cons are the soft-touch coating on the upper band, which I imagine may get nicked if abused.. and similarly, the leatherette fabric of the ear cups and inner band are soft and remind me of a more delicate fabric used in another headset I own. I can only hope it holds up well/better to sustained creasing. Due to how the ear cups close on themselves, I do feel the need to adjust the band to the lowest size when not in use to prevent the ear cups from pressing together, but perhaps I'm just babying them ;) Comfort: I like the thick cushioning provided on these, which compensate for a greater-than-expected amount of clamp to the head. Still, I found my ears still had breathing room inside the cups, though with time that seal may lead to some lack of breathability. During my play I didn’t find it an issue. They are comfortable and sound fantastic. Sound: I hadn’t used a headset while playing Forza Horizon 5 for a while and I was amazed at what I was missing. A sandstorm within the game was amazingly immersive while using these, with improved surround atmospheric sounds and effects. No complaints, sound is quality, clear and fully adjustable. App: This may be the first time I was so impressed by a companion app. I have a PC, but noticed that it was also offered on Mac so I checked it out there. So many settings can be tweaked from a clear interface, customization of the wheel, hotkeys for PC gaming, and more. It just works and looks great. Clean and minimal, matches the Xbox green theme, plus no ads! Features: I was pleasantly surprised by the thought that went into these. The customizable wheel to control things like ‘superhuman hearing’ that adjusts certain sounds so you can pick up on them more, chat, etc. and a mic that mutes you upon flipping it up. I’m sure not all of what’s here is new, but they come together in a nice package. (including those easy-swap batteries!) In summary, Turtle Beach created a great product that should be regarded as a solid, top-tier choice in gaming headsets."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Turtle Beach has been making dedicated gaming headsets since 2005. They’re one of the first companies to cater to gamers, and I’ve had several of their headsets in the last 15 or so years. They have catered to gamers in general and have also had respectful, consumer-friendly pricing. In the previous ten years, other companies have stepped up and manufactured higher-tier gaming headsets, seemingly keeping Turtle Beach behind within the middle class. However, with the introduction of the Stealth Pro Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headset, they’re ready to take the crown of the best pair of headphones in the gaming world. I’ve been blessed to have been able to own, since launch, not only the PlayStation 5 but the Xbox Series X as well. For reference, for the PS5, I have Sony’s Inzone H9, and for the XSX, I’ve had the Corsair 75XB, which I’ve had since the Xbox One days. I’ve been meaning t to upgrade the Corsair for a few years, but I have been waiting for the perfect headset– I believe I’ve found it. The first thing you’ll notice when you unbox the Stealth Pro is its build quality. They’re boxed well and come with an inviting presentation when you unbox them. They’re super light but still possess the heft required to feel comfortable and stable on your head. The ear cups are plush and soft but feel strong enough to withstand taking them off and on and off again. I’ve tested them out for over 6 hours the last few days, and I can say I never felt the need to take a break from wearing them and didn’t feel like my ears were in a sauna, as other headsets can make you feel. All the buttons have an excellent click to them and feel premium. A plate on the left earcup houses the battery, which you can quickly transfer out with the additional battery on the transmitter/charging stand. The included microphone can be taken off or adjusted upward to mute. I love this because, many times, I play single-player games and don’t want the mic to get in the way, so the option to take it entirely off is always welcomed. But when I play multiplayer games, muting quickly is important because kids are running around in the background, and it’s always good gamer etiquette not to have anything loud while playing. Thankfully, the charging port is USB-C, the industry standard nowadays. This headset is a premium, top-quality accessory for any serious gamer. It has many features which will present sound front and center. This headset sounds impressive. I’ve been playing Dead Space (the 2022 remake), and that game’s sound is one of the best examples of sound design in gaming today. I also watched the FX TV series, Snowfall, which sounded fantastic with these. Movie and TV fans will love the quality of these cans. Often, the sound quality decreases with noise-canceling features – not with these! This sounds amazing, with or without the noise-canceling on. To me, that’s the essential aspect of any headset. The noise-cancelation is excellent for any player looking to game within a busy home. It reduces background noise enough to ignore your family for a few hours (which is needed as an adult!). The sound and the fit must be top-tier to get me to invest any money. The Stealth Pros hit both marks exceptionally well. These are pricey but worth it if you want a genuinely top-of-the-line headset. Throughout the four days I’ve had with them, I haven’t found any cons, only pros (no pun intended). I did think I had an issue setting it up, however. The Bluetooth connection was easy to set up with my Xbox, but the transmitter pulsed read instead of solid green, so I assumed I’d done something wrong. But the transmitter will beat red when your microphone is off the headset or mute. So don’t panic if you see red on the transmitter. Just turn your mic on or attach it – the red will turn solid green. It’d be nice to turn off the LED color or customize it, but I understand why it is used as a code to let you know you are indeed muted. Another aspect of these that is highly underreported (and maybe I’m adding to that with it being the end of the review) is that these work with not only Xbox but Playstation, PC, and the Nintendo Switch! To only need one headset for all consoles is a blessing, even though I own multiple headsets. Knowing I can use these top-of-the-line cans to play on any console is a huge bonus. I’d recommend these to any serious gamer out there or those who want the best sound they can find – which is all of us.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Pros Multi-platform Almost neutral sound profile Boom mic audio very good Dual simultaneous audio sources Swappable battery with spare Sturdy Metal Construction Carrying case with separate pocket for receiver Adjustable active noise cancelling for speaker and mic Good noise cancelling Nearly neutral sound Settings are stored in headphones directly Adjustable noise gate Adjustable side tone USB-C connection Ear cups rotate to store headphones around neck Decent wireless range Cons Heavy for the size of the headband Headphones squeeze tight on larger heads No dual side USB-C cable included Built in mic too distant Treble a bit too high with default settings Buttons not distinct for use by touch Design and Features Out of the box, the Turtle Beach Stealth looks far more restrained in style compared to previous generations of their gaming headsets. The earcups have a traditional round design and the construction is of metal and black plastic. Construction feels heavy and solid. With boom mic removed they could pass as standard headphones. On the left side along with the boom mic is a battery cover which is held in place by magnets. The right earcup houses the mode buttons and dial. The earcups rotate allowing them to hang the around your neck. The base station/ charger is also made of metal and plastic and feels heavy for its size. Two batteries are included so one can charge in the base station while the other is in use. Included is a cloth carrying bag which has a separate pouch for the base station/charger to prevent damage from the two scraping against each other. There is also a USB-C port on the back of the right earcup which can be used to charge or update the headphones but with port pointing straight back usage seems awkward while plugged in. Performance and Usage Regardless of if you are configuring the Stealth Pro headphones via the smartphone app or the computer software your settings are saved directly on the headphones. No need to create a cloud account or internet connection to have settings saved. The specs state the batteries are good for 12 hours. So far there hasn’t been a need to change batteries to verify runtime in part because of how the headphones feel. While the headphones feel well built, the pressure the band exerts on the side of your head if you have a larger head makes extended use uncomfortable. The weight might also be a negative for some. Other family members who used them expressed the weight combined with the size of the headband made extended use uncomfortable for them. If you normally enjoy extended gaming sessions, you might be less sensitive to these issues. In our family no one typically games for more than an hour at a time. Beyond that, the earcups are thick and soft and offer plenty of room. The headphones can be used either with the boom mic or the built in mic but the built in mic is more intended for things like phone calls. The boom mic is very good at picking up speech clearly producing a rich, natural sound. The integrated mic is a different story. It works fine for phone calls if needed but it makes speech sound distant and with lots of background noise. You can adjust the noise gate to try to filter this out, but it tends to cut out voices too much before it is affective enough with the built in mic. While it is nice to have an integrated mic, in most cases you will be better off with the boom mic. You have the option of adjustable sidetone. It works well, but in some cases, it could use a bit more volume than max currently allows. Audio quality is surprisingly good. Overall, the Stealth Pro sounds fairly neutral with the exception of the highs being a bit exaggerated. While they are likely tuned this way to improve speech clarity, a little more bass and a little less treble sounds more pleasing. Of course this is subjective and it is fully tunable. Both the audio and mic have preset EQ options as well as fully customizable 10-band equalizer options so you can tune things to your exact preference. The ANC comes in handy to block out background sounds when playing in a noisy area, such as with family around. You can adjust how aggressive the noise cancellation is, but after setting 7-8 you start to hear a hiss or static sound. For gameplay you can also turn on a feature called superhuman hearing which helps to emphasize either sounds of footsteps or gunshots but it didn’t seem necessary in the games played. Game/ Chat mix is also adjustable from the app or from the headset depending on how you configure the action button and wheel. At first it seemed this feature was on PC as well, but it is only on Xbox. The reason is on PC those channels are controlled separately in Windows. While you can only have the mic connected to one source you can have the sound connected to two. This is a nice touch if you want to hear gameplay while also being on a call or listening to music. Some sources can change their own volume but neither audio source can exceed the set volume of the headphones. While the Stealth Pro are good, they aren’t without some quirks such as how long it takes for them to start up and connect. The control buttons on the right ear are not very distinct so finding the correct one by touch is difficult. There is no way to control which Bluetooth source is connected except to turn off Bluetooth on other devices which the headphones were previously paired until the desired device is connected. Also, from time to time, the action button would cease to function when connected via Bluetooth. It would just beep, and nothing would change. Final Thoughts Overall, the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro headphones are not without their quirks and could use some further software refinements. That said, they are a solid offering in the wireless gaming headphones. If you are in the market for wireless gaming headphones and would like them to serve equally well as both gaming and music headphones, the Turtle Beach Steal Pro headphones are worth a look.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have bought all the top gaming headphones in the last month, these are the BEST of them ALL !!

The only thing is I expected the music quality to be just a little bit better for these being beats. It’s great tho. Not enough difference to make a fuss over.

I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal, so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The Bose stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing, and the fit is very comfortable for long periods of wear, they are very comfortable. These do not have noise-canceling but excellent sound quality. If you're getting them so you can hear the environment's true outside sounds due to the open design, they are perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear, but don't get dismayed no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you use your earbuds, you won't be disappointed, these are perfect. I have used a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software, and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Bose headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before, like tap touch control. This feature comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. The Charging case snaps closed, and the ear buds snap into the case through magnets and clips, and they are super secure in my opinion, just in case you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time, and I was not able to completely drain them in a single listen. The Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones. All in all, these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper, or they go on sale, it's a no-brainer."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the Bose ultra earbuds about three weeks ago and overall, I’m very happy with them. They’re extremely comfortable, and very easy to put on and take off. The connection between the front and back of the earbuds is made of an elastic material so they are never too tight. The quality of the sound is excellent. The highs come through nicely, which usually isn’t a problem for this type of earbud, but what stands out is that the base is nice and full. The only criticism I have is that I wish they were a bit louder. I frequently find myself listening to them at maximum volume. That is the only reason I gave him four stars instead of five. But I have no issue recommending them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are of exceptional quality. They are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, allowing me to stay connected with my family and friends effortlessly. I can enjoy podcasts, music, or my favorite documentaries without interruption. Additionally, I no longer experience ear infections, thanks to these earbuds. The battery life is impressive and lasts a long time. The immersive audio is super cool!', 'I bought my earbuds a little under a month ago and I absolutely LOVE them! I loved them so much I purchased a pair for my husband right away and he’s a dj, so he knows “sound” & he thinks they’re great too! Amazing Buy!!']"

I've had tons of soundcore earbuds and these are my favorite from a bean style. Some others I've tried from soundcore are Liberty 3 Pro, Liberty Air 2 Pro, Note 3i, Dot 3i, Dot2 NC and many more. Audio fidelity is crisp on these and the EQ options in the App give me lots of ability to tweak sound."", 'I’ve been looking for some replacement commuter ANC earbuds to replace my flaky Samsung Buds2 (which are pretty good). Research seemed to keep recommending these (see rtings best ANC earbuds list). Extremely good noise cancelling, good transparency mode, quite good sound quality if a bit lacking in warmth. Very good app too. Black Friday made these insanely cheap and I’d put these only a marginal drop down from AirPods Pro, Buds2 Pro, Sony 1000’s at a third or less the cost.', ""Pros - Sound is nice and balanced. - Buds work independently, so even if you take one out you can listen to music in the other. - Lightweight and fit nicely in ears. Includes multiple tips for customization. - Case is very nice. Small. Lights to indicate battery. Reset button on back. Cons - Noise canceling is far less impressive than my previous (different brand) earbuds. - Tips are silicone rather than foam (which likely impacts noise canceling.) - Tap controls are not intuitive and manual isn't very helpful. (Google a video.)"", 'It\'s unfortunate how much dump these earbuds get by not having the perceived brand value like Bose and Sony. This is unbeatable at its price point: long battery life, LDAC/high-def codec support, extremely light and comfortable fit, ANC and transparency mode, frequent firmware updates and app support with flexible EQ settings, and not to mention great customer service with 18 months warranty. This is the kind of value proposition that you would get in earphones priced twice or three times its price. These earphones probably won\'t ""wow"" you (maybe, if you have LDAC mode on), but it will basically trump over any other devices within the same price range. Anker is desperate in dominating the budget earbuds market, and it really shows. As much as I would like to applaud the company for displaying a gold standard in this market, I\'d like to thank the (insert basic audio brand) die-hard fans for showing their earnest criticism on this wonderful product and keeping the prices low. This really pushes Anker to the limit, and I can\'t wait to find out what they have up their sleeves.', ""These are my first Bluetooth earbuds. I'm blown away by the depth of the sound, the deep bass and the bright treble. They pair instantly with anything - the TV, the laptop, the smartphone. The app is amazing. I particularly like the fit test. I run it each time I insert the buds just to make sure they are in correctly. I haven't begun to explore the many choices for the equalizer. I'm just using the presets for now, which are great. I have one ear that requires a hearing aid. I used the app to analyze my hearing through the earbud, and it made the adjustments for that ear. The profile was saved in the app. I got used to the tap controls for volume, pause and switching modes. The noise cancellation is exceptional. The wireless charging case is perfectly small. I've used the buds for hours already and still have 80% left on them. You can't beat these earbuds for the price."", ""way to low on the volume the EQ settings suck balls i have tried like 6 pairs of soundcore headphones and these are the worst of the bunch the best earbuds i have tried from soundcore are the life not 3i they rock really awesome and the second best are the life dot 2 nc are really well to however the noise cancelling seems to only work once they it never works again be smart by the cheaper option for some reason the cheaper soundcores have way better sound and are way louder with the space a40'S you hear everything around you noise canceling does not work at all be smart and don't even buy soundcore you are setting yourself up for disappointment i am glad i never paid for any of my soundcore headphones they are trash"", ""I was looking for affordable earphones that would work with my iPhone. The Apple AirPods were out of my budget. I initially tried the Google pixel pro buds since the price was reasonable but they couldn't connect to my iPhone efficiently so I returned them. The ankor soundcore earbuds were really easy to set up and are very iPhone friendly. They connect to my iPhone easily and the battery lasts so long. I took them on a 3 week trip to Europe and never had to charge them and it's still at 2/3 battery! They come with 5 different earbud sizes so they accommodate different fits. I'm no sound officionado but I think the earbuds sound great. I have had these earbuds for over a year and I'm really happy with them. Worth it."", ""I have had them for a week now and they are very good. For the sound quality, I'm very impressed playing around with the EQ and you have the perfect sound for your ears. Noise cancelling is okay. The battery is very good and last for 6.5 hours in LDAC Hi-DEF mode, you can switch off the LDAC mode and the battery will last for 7.5 to 8 hours depending on if you have the ANC on or off."", 'After reading many good reviews of these earbuds, and also owning a pretty good pair of over-ear wireless by Anker, I bought these earbuds this weekend, mostly for use in the gym. And this is also mostly where they fail. First the good- I like the app and the customization of the controls. The sound is OK, pretty clean overall, and the EQ is customizable which is a must for me- however there is only +-6dB on each band (for the non-musical, this means that there is not a very large range of cut and boost for each frequency- most EQs have 12dB). But I could live with the EQ the way it is. I did say the sound is pretty clear, and it is, but is also has a signature that I really don\'t find that pleasing and tweaking the EQ could not result in a sound I was really happy with. Hard to put my finger on it but I just don\'t find them that enjoyable to listen to, but agin, mostly for the gym so it\'s not that big a deal. My last pair was a set of Jabra Elite 3, which I unfortunately lost as they were great in all respects. Now for the bad. The main thing is that they are terrible at staying in my ears- tonight in the gym one or the other fell out three times in an hour. This is just unacceptable. I know these are not dedicate ""sport"" buds and therefore lack wings or other stability features, but come on- you should be able to use them on the elliptical or turn your head to the side when you\'r a little bit sweaty. The problem seems to be that the nozzle (the part that goes in your ear canal) is too short for the weight of the body of the earbud, and also the silicone seems to be not as grippy as on other earbuds. It\'s REALLY annoying when you have to stop your workout to retrieve an earbud. Not sure why the designers would go with this. Yes, I tried all the tip sizes, and it made zero difference. So now I\'m looking at replacement foam tips or add-on wings or something. The other thing I don\'t like is how sensitive the touch controls are- it\'s easy to trigger a command just by casually brushing the surface- and as I was constantly trying to push the buds in farther so they wouldn\'t FALL OUT, this was a continual hassle. My last gripe is that there is no way to turn the buds off, except by putting them back into the charging case. This is a major flaw IMHO. It means always needing the case- what if you wanted to wear them for the day, say while commuting, and turn them off when you get to work? It\'s not possible. Again, what idiot designer made this choice? Yes, there is an auto-off function in Settings, but the shortest time option is 30 minutes, So you need to turn Bluetooth off on your phone, and 30 minutes later the buds with shut down. Wishing now I would have bought another pair of Jabra.', ""I kept on hearing people praise them so I picked them up. They're OK, but the ANC is terrible compared to my Jabras. And they use touch sensitive buttons which I dislike.""]"

From the app you can choose to optimize sound for music or for speech. The battery life is very long. It’s been 24 hours and I haven’t had to charge them yet.

This fit exactly inside your ear which I like because I use my radio and set it to timer and this earbud doesn't get undone.

First, they are without a doubt the best looking pair I own. They combine matte, gloss, and transparent design elements. Second, there is a slight banana curve and the stems are very short which I really like. Third, the eartips are oval, fit my ears perfectly, and help significantly with noise cancellation. They paired quickly and without issue to my brand new Moto G 5G 2023. I suggest that buyers download the iQ app and complete the Personal Sound profile. It definitely amplifies music and I found that it was not necessary for me to apply any additional equalizer settings. Music from Pandora, YouTube, and Soundcloud along with audiobooks and podcasts from Hoopla, Libby, and Google all sound great. The additional app features of button mapping are a plus especially for volume control. The voice commands with ""Hey Skullcandy"" worked well for me in playing, pausing, toggling ANC, and activating assistant. My only dislikes are lack of support for Bluetooth codecs like AptX HD and the app occasionally drops my settings. Overall I would recommend these earbuds, especially when on sale as there is a lot to like.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very happy with this product. Really simple to use and connect. Tells you when the earbuds are connected to the Bluetooth . Really comfortable in my ears and have different ear buds to use for comfort. Pop them in the case to charge. Charging case holds 20 hours of power and the ear buds hold 7 hours of power. Use rapid charge for 10 minutes and it gives you 2 hours power so really really great if you’ve forgotten to charge overnight. Over all very impressed and happy that the earbuds actually stay in your ears without constantly having to manoeuvre them', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are such a delight compared to my Apple AirPods. The technology is by far superior, the range from my devices is amazing and connecting to two devices at one time is a treat! I am still getting to grips with all the functions but I am loving the voice control of the earbuds and the app which comes with it. I only have little ears (lol!) so it took a minute to get them comfortable but I love them. I can’t see me going back to my AirPods now I have these. So far I can’t find a single fault with them!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Received these today. I was super excited to try them out as I’ve only used Apple AirPods before. They were very easy to connect to my iPhone. Quick & easy set up. Instructions were very helpful. They fit my ears so nicely and they also came with extra buds in case you needed a different fit! So that’s amazing as a lot of in ear earphones don’t come with bud bits. I’ve used them to listen to different genres of music and I was honestly surprised. They sound amazing! I have nothing but good feedback, I’ve also used them to connect to my Nintendo switch for gaming and they work that way too. For their price they’re so worth the money and if you’re looking for some affordable and amazing quality Bluetooth earphones.. these are them! They fit perfectly in my back pocket too which is a bonus. Design is super sleek and I just love them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Excellent sound and volume, no problems hearing music, phone calls, or any notifications. Call clarity was surprisingly great, way better than my old Galaxy buds. They support wireless charging so I can charge my watch and these on the same cable which is super convenient, plus I only have to charge them once every couple days, so if I forget to charge them one night it's not a problem at all. The fit is pretty nice, they don't fall out but if you get sweaty they definitely slip a bit which really isn't a big deal. Only problem is I sometimes have problems with it pairing automatically and I have to mess with it to get it to work.

I like how the app keeps me to personalize the audio for the music I enjoy. I've stopped them more times than I care for, but the case doesn't pop open all the time making my ear buds fly in different directions. Their water resistance helps me not miss anything when I tend to spray water on myself to cook down at work. They are great all cancelling the noise around me, or let some through so I can be aware of my surroundings. The app is user friendly, but it won't work unless you have your location active. One ear bud can last me up to seven hours before the Rail ANC app let's me know that it's low on battery."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these earbuds. They fit into my ear nicely and don't give the feeling they want to fall out. The noise cancelling is exactly what I would expect. They hold a great charge and allow me to wear a long time between charges. All it takes is a gentle tap to adjust the volume and it responds well. It produces a great clear sound and connects to bluetooth effortlessly. The only negative is the charging cord is super short. I can't plug these into my kitchen wall outlet and reach the countertop. They dangle and I don't like that so I have to use a surge protector in order for it to lay flat. I also wish the charging cable was a little more of a heavy duty cord."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was sent these headphones for my honest review .

Has a good case and easy to charge. Don't have negative thing to say about the products because it work very well."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am so impressed with these ear buds, initially I found the fit a little awkward but I swapped out the ear pieces for the smaller ones and they fit perfectly, I have a lot of piercings around my conch area and earbuds falling out has always been an issue for me but it doesn’t happen with these. The sound quality is fantastic, I compared them to my partners a**le wireless ear buds and the quality is on par, I also compared the specs to his and the charge is quicker and longer. But I think the most impressive thing is the noise cancellation, I can have the anc on with nothing playing and be barely able to hear what’s going on around me, I have very sensitive hearing and can pick up on the slight whooshing sound of the anc feature but I actually find it quite relaxing, the earbuds themselves are a little bulkier than other wireless earbuds but I don’t necessarily like that, and with them being black and me having very dark hair, they don’t stand out, so I can have them in and people can’t tell which I like. On a final and personal note, I’ve noticed my focus has increased significantly whilst using these, I would 100% buy them again']"

I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear, but don't get dismayed no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you use your earbuds, you won't be disappointed, these are perfect. I have used a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software, and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Bose headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before, like tap touch control. This feature comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. The Charging case snaps closed, and the ear buds snap into the case through magnets and clips, and they are super secure in my opinion, just in case you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time, and I was not able to completely drain them in a single listen. The Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones. All in all, these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper, or they go on sale, it's a no-brainer."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the Bose ultra earbuds about three weeks ago and overall, I’m very happy with them. They’re extremely comfortable, and very easy to put on and take off. The connection between the front and back of the earbuds is made of an elastic material so they are never too tight. The quality of the sound is excellent. The highs come through nicely, which usually isn’t a problem for this type of earbud, but what stands out is that the base is nice and full. The only criticism I have is that I wish they were a bit louder. I frequently find myself listening to them at maximum volume. That is the only reason I gave him four stars instead of five. But I have no issue recommending them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are of exceptional quality. They are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, allowing me to stay connected with my family and friends effortlessly. I can enjoy podcasts, music, or my favorite documentaries without interruption. Additionally, I no longer experience ear infections, thanks to these earbuds. The battery life is impressive and lasts a long time. The immersive audio is super cool!', 'I bought my earbuds a little under a month ago and I absolutely LOVE them! I loved them so much I purchased a pair for my husband right away and he’s a dj, so he knows “sound” & he thinks they’re great too! Amazing Buy!!']"

"JVC HA-A18T-B - Marshmallow In-Ear Headphones, Bluetooth 5.3, With Charging Box and Touch Controls, Black",$79.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-ha-a18t-b-marshmallow-in-ear-headphones-bluetooth-5-3-with-charging-box-and-touch-controls-black/17110561/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] 28 hr maximum traveling battery life, using a Lithium ion battery enhanced case for recharging while mobile. This product was given to me for trial use and my subsequent evaluation, at no charge, by JVC for the BestBuy Tech Insiders Network. Features: Easily adjust volume and answer phone calls or mute the music for less aural competition while having a conversation with a live person with simple tap on the surface of the ear bud Built in microphone in the earpiece, discrete but effective. There was no excess noise pickup from normal surroundings that required a lot of repeating what was said during a phone call. Water resistant to IP X4, officially “rain resistant” headphones, but the case is NOT IP-X rated connects easily to my iPhone via Bluetooth version 5.3 Includes a USB-C compact cord for recharging the case; the earphones recharge automatically when returned to the case The packaging was nearly plastic free; no plastic to toss into the waste stream, but rather all recyclable paper box and liners. There was a drawstring storage bag that was plastic film, that is recyclable, if you do not need one more carrying bag. Extra size ear molds are included: a rather standard rubbery plastic in S,M, and L. Plus two “memory foam” fittings in a S and M. I am assuming the texture of the memory foam was the derivation of the brand name “Marshmallow” that they assigned to the product. Features we liked: Price is quite reasonable, certainly well below the top of the line, but higher than many similar products widely available sound quality and music fidelity was very nice; our preference is mostly classical, and the full fidelity of the entire orchestra was quite good speed and reliability of the Bluetooth pairing with the iPhone; not a lot of extra fiddling with the Settings app on the phone; pairing was seamless and quick ease of adjusting volume and muting with a simple tap of the side of the earbud case and charging is secure, easy to remove and replace the earphones, and the lid and the earpieces are held in position with magnetic latching so no inadvertent dropping of the case and loss of your headphone Small indicator lights on the case and the headphones that indicate when charging power is active (see photos) Features we did not like: The ear buds fit easily into my ear canals, but were too large for my wife. Even with the smallest size tips attached, they did not seat into her canals, and protruded excessively. They were therefore easily dislodged, and would not be trusted for outdoor wear, especially if for physical activity such as outdoor hiking or running, where the black colored ear bud would easily be lost from detection. So her use will be limited to indoors at home only. The photo shows how the small protrusion on the inferior edge that is supposed to ride in the Intertragic (see anatomy photo) notch protrudes and would be easily caught or brushed and dislodges the earbud. Even when they were maximally inserted, she could easily slide her finger behind the inferior protrusion of the headphone and her ear. Additionally, she has a sensitivity to a variety of plastic materials, creating a cutaneous reaction and irritation rather promptly. The plastic used for the ear pieces (both the memory foam and the regular ones) created a noticeable burning sensation within about 10 minutes of wearing. This will be a deal breaker for her to ever wear these. Her allergy is somewhat atypical, and probably is not an issue for 98% of the population, but if the customer has a reaction to other similar plastics (elastic waistbands, wristwatch polymer straps, etc.) they might want to avoid this product. She is NOT allergic to the silicone rubber watchband of the AppleWatch, for example. The black color would be a bit difficult to find if the small earbud fell while outdoors, unless you were on a smooth hard surface, such as a sidewalk or asphalt. In grass, along a walking path, gravel surface, etc. it might be near impossible to discover. This is where the extra value of Apple’s “Find My” technology could be worth the extra money. A pair of $50 headphones are less expensive, but not totally disposable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC wireless earbuds are surprisingly good. Though not noise canceling, they seem to block out most of the outside noise while in use. They come with a charging cord, different size earpieces and a charging case for storing them and charging when not in use. Using them is very simple. Once you charge them, the included instructions show you how to connect them to your phone via Bluetooth and how to use the buttons to change tracks, increase and lower volume and change sound modes. The three sound modes are normal-bass-clear and can be accessed with the button on either earbud. These are basic earbuds, but sound very good and with the different types of earpieces are not fatiguing to wear for long periods of time. I have been impressed with how good these sound with different types of music. From Rock to Pop to Standards, the JVC’s present crisp clear tone that sounds fuller than they would appear to, based on their size. The volume gets fairly loud, but not to the point that you would feel discomfort. For basic earbuds, these are great for on the run because of the small size of the charging case they don’t take up much room. The advertised battery life is twenty-eight hours and while I have been using them off and on for a week, and the charge seems to keep on going. One other great feature is they are water and sweatproof and they are great for working out. I can’t say enough about these mighty little earbuds. They are comfortable, sound great and waterproof. My only wish would be for them to be noise cancelling, but for the price you can’t have everything!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very Easy to start using the Marshmallow Headphones w/o Even Manuals and online help. I had these Headphones working on 2 devices in less than an hour. Just open your devices Blue-Tooth Configuration , select the headphone and pair them, it was remarkably simple and with a PIN Security code as optional, Product works with the Panasonic KX-TGD890 Cordless Handset and enhances your phone experience. The Blue tooth and Microphone work in Tandem to allow voice control, clear hands free mobile use of the cordless and remarkable quality to and from the headset and main line. It was also an ease to get it to work with my Android Phone, improving its Blue-Tooth Quality both in use of the microphone as well as the reception of voice, Music, Mail and Apps like Utube. Hands free calls from smart Phone and/or Gamin Blue Tooth GPS and its remarkable noise cancellation allow my 87yr mom who is hard of hearing to actually hear people in a fast food joint over 600 ft away, which I found even more remarkable. The Ear buds are universal and fit comfortably on any ear, are well made and designed to be durable. The Hard case and built in charger are quality products that can be charged at any 5V outlet using the same cable as your phone. A/C Wall Adapter NOT included.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Marshmallow True Wireless headphones come packaged with several sets of ear caps (3 silicone, 2 memory foam), a USB-C charging cable and a charging case. To get started with them, you simply pull the tabs off of the earbuds, place them in the charging case to activate them, and remove them to pair them to your device. Because these are rated as ‘low latency’ they are supposed to be good for gaming. I tested them by listening to several tracks of music on my iPhone 14 Pro. Comfort: The headphones are comfortable. They are very lightweight so you barely notice them. I did feel as though they stuck out from my ears quite a bit, but they never felt insecure to me. I ended up using the small silicone ear tips. I did try the small memory foam tips, but they seemed to just push the earbuds out of my ears. I’m not sure if I would be comfortable wearing these earbuds for long periods of time, but they weren’t uncomfortable for the hour or so that I wore them for testing. Sound Quality: I found the sound quality to only be average. There is no active noise cancelling but the earbuds do a good job with basic sound isolation. I wasn’t able to hear much around me when music was playing at full volume. That said, if a music track was quiet, I could hear ambient noises creep through. I was able to hear music clearly, but the low-end was lacking. I have a playlist designed around different types of music and everything just fell flat to me. Ease of Use: The headphones are very easy to use. They have basic touch controls embedded into the earbuds themselves with each individual earbud controlling different functions. As I mentioned there is no ANC or other special features that are built into the earbuds so you really just get play/pause, advance, volume up and down as the controls. Value: Since True Wireless earbuds can cost three times more than these Marshmallow headphones do I would say these are a good value. They are simple, basic wireless earbuds with an average sound quality.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For the price you shouldn’t be expecting high fidelity and that’s the reality of these earbuds. They don’t have significant bass but they do offer fairly good clarity. Fit overall isn’t a major plus/minus as they’re serviceable. My use for these earbuds are for when my kids want their first set and don’t want wires. The lack of volume is actually a bonus here because you won’t be concerned about damaging their ears versus a set that they can blast at high volume. With this budget friendly approach I’m not constantly concerned about a pair getting lost or left behind. This holds true for quick trips where I’ve forgotten my earbuds and just need a quick pair to get through the day. In that regard I now keep this pair in my backpack as a backup pair for those days I invariably forget to charge my main set. Case works well but placement is a bit finicky for smaller fingers. The real shining star here is the number of replacement tips they include with 2 sets of foam and 3 sets of rubber tips. I haven’t seen a plethora of options like that in years with most manufacturers assuming you’ll just buy your own tips if you want foam ones. Overall these earbuds are really great for their use case - a budget set of Bluetooth headphones and are an easy grab versus a standard wired set as a similar price makes getting the wireless set an easy choice.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are not too bad for the money, but don’t expect much from them. They will only sound ok if you get a decent seal from the different sized tips included with them. Even with a good seal, they only sound ok to my ears for music or video. Again, these are very low priced earbuds so I am not totally surprised here. I also found them to be quite tight in my ears, but I know that will vary on the user. They come with medium size attached right out of the box, but even the smaller sized tips they also come with were a little tight in my ears. I was able to get an ok seal with one of the tips for my ears. The sound was just ok for music or anything else. I tried these with my Pixel 6A, and had some issues getting one earbud to connect, but eventually it did. A selling point of these earbuds is its low latency mode, and while I didn’t witness any out of sync audio, I also didn’t notice it with that mode not in use. Same with my Steam Deck game device. No noticeable latency either with it on or off, either for videos, or for actual games. If there is one big selling point for these earbuds it is that they do have very good battery life and because they are so low priced, if you lose them you won’t be losing a very expensive set. They are rated at 7.5 hours on a full charge, and I am pretty sure I got at least this much out of them before they needed to be put back in the charging case. Overall, I would say these might be a good option for someone who might lose earbuds or similar small sized items, but look elsewhere if you want sound quality. There is no equalizer, just 3 settings they refer to as normal, clear, and bass.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Received the JVC Low Latency Earbuds Marshmallow TWS shortly after choosing them to review. They arrived packed nicely and included are 3 pair of different size silicone ear tips. Also you'll find one large and one small pair of foam ear tips. I put on the smaller foam ear tips as they felt the most comfortable. Please note that when you place the foam ear tips on DO NOT TWIST THEM. You simply push them straight onto the earbud. JVC even includes a paper note that illustrates this procedure. They also include a clear, concise instruction guide. You will need to have your own charger, which was not a problem for me as I have plenty, but JVC does provide the short charging cord. Once charged I connected them via Bluetooth to my phone and that went without a hitch. You have 3 sound choices ~ Normal, Bass or Clear. There are other functions you can do by simply pressing on the bud as shown in the guide. They're very simple to use! Each earbud can also be used independently of the other which is a great feature. Once they were fully charged I proceeded to listen to some of my own recorded music (yes I sing) and WOW! I figured listening to my own video recordings was the best first test. Well I can say these earbuds sounded out of this world great with absolutely NO latency whatsoever with my videos. Other earbuds I own can't even come close in that respect and sound quality, especially since these are so inexpensive! As far as the memory foam ear tips I found them VERY comfortable and my ears didn't start itching like they sometimes do with silicones, especially after long wear times. Impressive! I then listened to professional music and video shows on You Tube and all had no latency or any other problems. I personally like the Normal mode for all around listening as there are no muffled music or voices whatsoever but it still has that nice push with just enough bass. The CLEAR I found is a wee bit harsh, even with just listening to an audiobook and of course the Bass gives you more of a richer sound. It's personal preference of course. We all hear things differently. One more neat thing is when you change the sound mode it is announced. She will say NORMAL, BASS, CLEAR when you push the bud to change. I liked that. These charged fast, held it for a long time and are VERY well built, especially for the low price. They have a nice case that shows you the charge by white dots on the front. Honestly the sound blew me away as well as the convenient features and I can definitely recommend their purchase! You can't go wrong. I love mine and they could easily be priced much higher. Thanks JVC for offering such a superb product at an affordable price!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] You can\'t go wrong with earbuds nowadays. They all sound good, they all look good, and they can take a beating. I think it all boils down to which one can do ""the job"" and be reasonably-priced. This JVC marshmallow earbuds is a serious contender, especially that it is very reasonably-priced. It comes in a light case. The overall weight is a little light and the size is a bit larger than most earbuds. The material of the plastic does not feel premium, which is expected at this price point. The hinges though are nicely made and the fit of the buds inside are snug. The surface feel of the case is just like any plastic, but it does not feel flimsy or cheap—you just know it is inexpensive but it does not sacrifice the overall experience. The earbuds itself is made of the same material but feels more premium. It is solid, although the way it sits in the case can be a little disorienting to remove and place back in because the case holes do not directly translate to the shape of the buds. Now, putting it on may be a little challenging for most people who are not used to wearing those sponge earplugs. The “marshmallow” material used in the earbuds is made of the same material used for earplugs—you pinch them to decrease the size, then you place them in your ears. If you do not do it correctly, the buds will fall out, and if done correctly, they stay in perfect position. It does come with different sized tips, and you can also opt for the normal non-“marshmallow” tips, which are also included. Although I suggest to stick with the marshmallow ones because they enhance the the quality of the audio. Connectivity is easy—it’s pretty much turn on and play. Voice prompts from the buds are on point on what you need to do and my phone easily recognized it for pairing. The connection is pretty tight. I DID NOT HAVE ANY DROPS which is huge for me. I even forgot that my phone was in the kitchen because the phone connection was solid—I was on a phone call and the kitchen to the office was 40 feet away with a concrete firewall in between. Call quality is decent—nothing notable – just straightforward doing its job. Audio quality is decent as well—it is nothing impressive, and usually I look for crisp quality and range of high to lows. But again, it is decent—and the fit of the “marshmallows” keep the sound intact so the quality is focused on the audio. Because it is made of this “marshmallow” material, it cancels noise VERY WELL. I will recommend this on plane travels because it cancels out environment noise. However, I do not recommend it being used for anything that requires you to be mobile, such as running (especially outdoors) because you will not hear anything—you will not have a sense of your immediate environment. These earphones are great for focused audio. Overall, it is a good set. It has no frills and it does “the job” for me. Calls, audio and treadmill runs. If you want something simple and reliable without breaking the bank, this one is good for you too.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So i have tried to use wireless earbuds before but never really had any luck because the earbud would just fall out of my ear after about 5 minutes of use. But i am the type of guy who never gives up so i tried these jvc True Wireless Headphones and i could not be happier. When you first open the package it's a little daunting of a task to get the box open. They must have had a team of engineers design this box because you have one compartment with the earbuds and one compartment with the earbuds earpieces to help fit your ear. Now i must say on other earbuds i have gotten you normally get like one extra set of the little rubber part incase the ones you put on first get torn. Well not in these jvc earbuds you get an envelope with different sizes and a bunch of them. So you not only have a great selection of sizes to fit your ear canal but you have enough of them to last a lifetime. These are noise canceling earbuds and i work in a restaurant that is super loud in the kitchen area so if i just want to cut the noise down a ton i don't even need to listen to music just put them in and i don't have a headache in 2 minutes. The sound quality is unbelievable. You have 3 modes for the sound base, Normal and clear. I use the base and you can definitely hear the difference. There are touch sensors on each earbud 1 tap is pause/play 2 taps is volume down and 3 taps is volume up but obviously you can control the volume with you phone also and the is a touch sensor on each earbud. Two last things these earbuds fit my ear comfortably and do not fall out and they also have a 28 hour use. Make sure you charge them fully once you open them up to give you the best and longest life of the battery's. Honestly for the price you are getting some what feels and sounds like higher end earbuds."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC HAA18TB Earbuds are a serious contender at the price point they are being sold at, simple as that I jnow what youbare reading these reviews for, are they loud? How do they fit? How is the bass? And last, how long does the battery last? I am about to give you the results of my testing and comparison to my favorite earbuds First, the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is simply because no matter the rubber adapter for my ear, they do ot stay in, the shape does not work for my ears but does for my wife. With that said, I do still use these for things like mowing, desk work and just relaxing. I use earbuds almost 24/7 due to a major ear defect I have that causes tinnitus at a high level almost my entire life. As for the bass, they hit real nice but are definitely fake tuned to give more bass than you need. I actually adjusted the bass way down on my equalizer on my phone, tablet and PC to compensate and boom, great sounds all around after that. The mids are clear, not muddy at all, and the highs are crisp and clean with a tad sound blurriness past 12k hz, for the price, I can 100% expect and accept this tiny downfall. Are they loud? Heck yes they are loud, especially in my wife's ears as they sit in much farther and seal up to the outside world better she cannot wear them at full volume. The sound will get distorted at high volumes, its not hard to find their threshhold and pass that, so be careful. The battery is amazing, period. I can go a week on a case charge and still have some left over. I wear them about 4 hours a day, so the advertised battery level, depending on your volume, last well over that number for me. Would I buy them at retail or sale price? At retail without a doubt, on sale, I will pick up an extra set for my wife and for me. I can 100% recommend these but make sure to try all the adapters right away and find the right fit, just in case your ears are shaped weird like mine. As for comparing to my $230 earbuds, they acrually throw a good fight with them besides the comfort and fit. The sound is close but well more defined on my expensive set. I hope you ejoy your JVC earbuds, they will be a great purchase for most people.""]"

The sound quality is good, fit is fairly good. There were numerous items that I'm not pleased with. The mic is either not working or the default output volume is too low. Even when I have the mic volume turn to maximum level on my PC or phone, the mic only registers 2% sound level. There are no adjustment features for the mic on the headphones that I've found. The touch / slide controls don't work well. The require heavy pressure and multiple attempts to adjust. They headphone do feel quite warm when worn for extended periods of 3 hours or more. Overall I'm quite disappointed with the product."", 'I have been searching endlessly for a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones for mobile gaming. I thought these fit the bill until I realized they shut themselves off while I’m in the middle of playing. This happens every 30 minutes or so, and I have to switch the power off and back on again. Very annoying and likely a dealbreaker if there isn’t a way to turn this feature off. The headband also is an issue, as it doesn’t stay in position. I have to readjust it every time I take them off. Lastly, my hair keeps getting caught in the track where the band adjusts.', ""I purchased two headphones, these K361-BT's and one from Bose. After listening on both, it was no competition. I returned the Bose over-ear headphones and kept these with no doubt in my mind that these are superior in sound quality. They are comfortable to wear, even with glasses. They appear to support AAC bluetooth codec, according to my MacBook Pro. The included cord accessories are handy; able to listen wired without sacrificing battery life. Overall a great product for the price."", '*K361-BT: The sound quality is amazing, the clarity of individual instruments is impressive and the lack of ""boosted"" millennial bass is also appreciated. My only recommendation would be to snug the size adjustment a little (I added electrical tape to restrict the movement). If they are bumped or catch on something they tend to loosen (I wear them while working on tractors and equipment so if your not inside an engine bay or under a machine you\'ll be fine). Just a heads up also if you have ""mechanic hands"", to many cuts and calluses the fancy controls won\'t like you. *K553 mk.II: I loved the K361\'s so much I replaced my ""at home"" headphones with these.

Pure musical ecstasy!', ""Great balanced sound, 50mm drivers allow to hear more details. Gesture control doesn't work well especially pause/play. The AKG app doesn't support this headphone, so you cannot use EQ. No pairing mode on this headphone, you need to disable BT on current device and then power off and on the headphone to pair it with another device."", ""Have been waiting for these to be available. I wanted to get the 371's but they are still not available so I went ahead with the 361's. Really enjoying these. They are super comfortable. The ear pads are super soft and fit over my ears great. I have tried several other over the ear headphones in the past and they did not fit my ears well or had too much clamping force. The sound quality is great. I'm hearing details in music I never noticed before. I wanted some bluetooth headphones that were affordable, neutral sounding, and comfortable. These fit the bill. Of note is that on the outside of the left ear piece, on the AKG circle, you control volume, track forward/back, and pause via swipe and tap motions(there might be other swipe controls I haven't discovered yet). They also turn off automatically after a certain amount of time not in use. With the slide on/off toggle they don't turn on accidentally in my bag either. Only negative is that the charging port is micro USB instead of USB C."", 'Great sound for the money. Connects just fine to my 2019 MacBook Pro.

They are perfectly matched with plenty of headroom for the output of my electronic drum module output and any other consumer level use.

Note: two cables are included and are proprietary twist lock style at the unit end over to standard 1/8” on the source side. One is three feet or so and the other at least six. advantage is they are replaceable.

I’m a singer so know music/sound, and for the size and price point these sound great. Three sound profiles, all excellent for respective uses; the bass setting is surprisingly solid. No distortion on any profile even at higher volumes. Very pleased with these buds. Finally, very easy to connect straight out of the box to my iPhone 14 pro max. Connects every time, no issues there.

JLab Studio Pro Over-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - Black,$35.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jlab-studio-pro-over-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-black/15299087/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] --- SETUP --- The setup for the JLAB Studio Pro wireless headphones is quick. They are fully charged out of the box so all you have to do is turn it on and pair it with your mobile device or computer. --- FEATURES --- The key feature of these headphones are that they are wireless, light, portable, and last up to 50 hours of playtime. It has 3 custom EQ sound settings to choose from and the cushions cover the ears. They can be charged with a USB C cable, which is included. --- PERFORMANCE --- I found the performance of these headphones to be a little weaker than most other headphones I own, but overall still enjoyable to use. Of the three EQ settings, I enjoy the bass boost option, but the other two are balanced and JLAB signature. I paired these with my iPhone and was able to use Siri by holding the ON button. When I received calls, I was heard very clearly and when my phone received calls or texts, I could hear the rings in the headphones without being too loud compared to what I was listening to at the moment. I tested these headphones with songs from Limp Bizkit, Korn, Jason Mraz, Colbie Caillat. I also tested them with an audio book, podcasts, and phone video games. Finally, I paired them with my gaming PC and tested them with games like Control and Mortal Shell. As far as songs go, bass boost is the way to go, and the songs sound fuller and more enjoyable. For audiobooks and podcasts, I like a balanced approach. I wouldn’t buy these to play phone games, as there is a delay in the audio with what’s happening on screen. For computer games, I enjoyed the games best on the JLAB signature mode and got really immersed in the games for hours. --- EXPECTATIONS --- The product meets my expectations. Overall, I found the headphones very enjoyable when wearing them for upwards of 5 hours a day with glasses. They are by far my most light headphones and look stylish without a break-the-bank price. It would have been nice if they came with a storage pouch, but for the price, I find that ok. --- VALUE --- The price for the headphones make them a great introduction to wireless headphones overall and will make a fabulous extra-nice stocking gift this coming holiday season. --- APPROVAL --- I highly recommend this product for people who are just entering the wireless headphone space and will be throwing these inside a backpack or gym back constantly without worrying too much about they getting damaged.', 'I was bought these and given as an early Christmas present. These are great headphones and I swear by it. Easy function and pairing. The sound quality is truly there, a full and rich sound even if the volume is low. They’re lightweight and fit on the head and ears comfortably. Easily portable as they aren’t heavy and fold up smoothly. And I can’t believe the quality (sound and build) especially for its affordable price. If you’re looking for a good quality product for a teen and don’t know what headphones to choose, this is the one. Will continue to buy from this company for audio tech stuff. Thanks mom!', ""I'm really enjoying these headphones so far! I hope they last me awhile. The EQ settings are cool and the settings are easy to use! I recommend these for those that like over-ear headphones and music lovers"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Out of the box, it was surprising how incredibly light these headphones are. They fit over my ears nicely without leaving an impression after hours of use. Pairing them was intuitive. In fact, I didn’t even need the instructions. I just held down the power button for a few seconds until the power light started flashing and then connected to the headphones in the bluetooth settings on my phone. I have enjoyed being able to control songs/calls from my phone using the controls on the headphones because my phone is not always in a convenient location (sometimes I am away from my desk when I need to answer a call). To change equalizer modes, the user must press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons at the same time. The first ten times I tried this, I didn’t notice any change. Finally, I realized that I wasn’t pressing them firmly enough. When pressed properly, the headphones announce the mode verbally. Here are my thoughts on each one: Balanced - Virtually no bass. Very tinny sound. Hollow. JLab Signature - Nice balance of bass, mid-tones, and treble. Could use a little more bass, in my opinion. Bass Boost - Definitely picks up more bass, but muddles the treble too much. I think the words “studio” and “pro” are misnomers because, while they are good quality headphones, the sound would need to be more dynamic to meet those qualifications. Still, overall, the headphones are lightweight and ideal for lengthy use. As someone who works from home, these make a lot of sense because I can listen to music from my phone and take calls from clients without having to worry about turning down the volume.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The ear cups are shaped to fit over my ears. This seems to make them more comfortable. They sound good and are easy to pair. I had no problem with my Moto E cellphone, but seem to have trouble getting the microphone to work on my laptop. Could be me. They sound good and are light, battery lasts so far a few days after charging and light use. Folds up nicely and can charge off any USB port of charging cube. Nice soft fabric on headband and cups.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my third experience with JLab audio and this, like my other 2 experiences did not disappoint. What you get with JLab is a well priced option that delivers good quality and really better than average sound. These headphones were simple to pair. Paired to S20 in a couple seconds. What I loved about these, was the simplicity of the controls. Often with headphones, the controls are ""too cute by half"". They try to do too much with too little. This set, very simple volume up/down, track fwd/bkd, pause and answer. Quite intuitive and the buttons are simple to work by one hand. Everything is sized right, placed right and offers enough feedback to provide positive confirmation. It has 3 built in ""EQ"" settings that offer enough difference to notice but I I preferred the default with the classic ""V shaped"" EQ visual bar. I think most people will leave that setting and never look back. That said, here is why I gave it a 4 star... I would prefer to have more control over EQ, but it\'s certainly not a deal breaker. As for sound quality, somewhere slightly above ""quite good"" and below ""excellent"". Sound was balanced, even and while bass was clear, it wasn\'t particularly punchy, but it was even. Mids were crisp and highs were crisp without being overbearing. These headphones are lightweight and comfortable, decently attractive and nicely finished for price point. In all, these are a great value and I would recommend them to a friend.', 'They fit great, look sharp and have good sound quality for the price. My sole complaints that they simply do not get loud enough for my tastes. Some of us like to blast music, and while these get plenty loud, they do not get loud enough in my opinion. I have seen others comment on this site about some of the headphones not getting loud enough. Seems to be a common problem that maybe you could fix, Jlab? Listen to the customer, eh?', 'I bought these a while ago and they are amazing! Honestly the best pair of headphones I have ever bought. But recently, the power button got jammed somehow and I cannot for the life of me unstick it. It really bothers me that there is not really a way to take these apart without breaking them. If there is, I can’t find on online. Please help!', ""The build quality of these headphones is amazing. The battery life is way more then you'll need for your day. Being as lightweight as they are and having the foam ear cups makes wearing them enjoyable. The matching backpack case is a very nice touch. JLAB take bow, because you have done an outstanding job with this product."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these headphones! I can’t wear ear pods because of the shape of my ears, they just fall out. Headphones are my go to but the headband can get uncomfortable after awhile. Not these, I can wear them my entire shift at work. The ear cups fit great and help to block outside sound. They are also padded so they are comfortable. I usually sweat with the cups over my ear but not as bad with this pair. I love how easy they are to charge, just plug in and the light will blink. When solid, they are charged. It usually takes 3-4 hrs for them to charge and playtime lasts over 10 hrs for me. Pairing with Bluetooth is easy and I’ve never had the connection fail. I can have the headphones on and paired to my phone and my phone be in another room and still no issues with connection or sound quality. Volume is loud, I never wear them at full volume. I like that you can control everything right on the ear cup and don’t have to have your phone constantly in your hand. These are the best quality headphones I’ve found at a great value. Highly recommend!']"

I love then more than my audio glasses. Thanks Boses again you have out done yourself!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got them a month ago and I completely love them. I have two autistic daughters and the earbuds let me stay alert while I immerse myself in music.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got them a month ago and I don’t like them because they don’t get loud enough and I have a hard time hearing people when I get a phone call', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] i got this a few days ago and it’s perfect for the gym i don’t like the regular earphones being in my ears so these were the perfect fit!', ""If I had to give someone a quick, down and dirty written review of these headphones, I think this would be it. I have been looking for earbuds like these for a while. I have a small ear canal, so using earbuds that fit into my ear Canals comfortably is hard for me. The Bose stay inside my ears regardless of what I'm doing, and the fit is very comfortable for long periods of wear, they are very comfortable. These do not have noise-canceling but excellent sound quality. If you're getting them so you can hear the environment's true outside sounds due to the open design, they are perfect at blending the two, outside sounds and inside sounds. I guess the volume at which you listen to media also determines how much of the outside you hear, but don't get dismayed no matter how loud the music is you will still hear extremely loud and important things such as car horns sirens etc. If that is the kind of environment that you use your earbuds, you won't be disappointed, these are perfect. I have used a lot of headphones and earbuds that have accompanied software, and I have to say that these have some of the best software that I have used. The companion Bose headphone app has all the useful feature like and EQ and more. It also has some features that I haven't seen before, like tap touch control. This feature comes in handy when you're wearing a beanie or hat that covers your ears. The Charging case snaps closed, and the ear buds snap into the case through magnets and clips, and they are super secure in my opinion, just in case you drop them. The battery life is great on them also I use them for the past couple of days for long periods of time, and I was not able to completely drain them in a single listen. The Sound quality is fantastic for open design headphones. All in all, these are my new favorite everyday driver headphones. This review pertains to the points that are import to me. I purchased them at the launch price and I think they are worth it. Get these if they are similar to what you prefer if they get a little cheaper, or they go on sale, it's a no-brainer."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First off, I had a little bit of visual design shock if you will, the first time I pulled the earphones out of their case. I had this same reaction when I saw people wearing earphones from the fruit company. Out of the box you get the earphones, a case/charger, a USB-C charging cable (Very short one at that), and a manual which you don’t really need as long as you download the app. Speaking of app, yes, like everything else in the world, you will need the app to pair, customize, etc… So turn on your camera app, and go download the app. Pairing is done via the app. It will ask for permission to access Bluetooth, and from there, it locates the earphones. It will ask you to create an account, and from there you go through a few tutorials on how to put them on, how to create custom listening presets, and how to press the drums buttons to fast forward, go to previous tack, answer calls, and control the volume. Once the shock of how the earphones look wore off, I found myself watching the tutorial on how to place the earphones into your ear and wrap it around, and I’ll be honest, it took a few tries. I thought I had to shove the sound emitting part of the earphone into my ear, and then wrap it around, but nope. You simply let it almost sit on your inner ear, and then wrap the drum around. I felt like I was trying to put on earrings. It didn’t feel natural, and still takes some time put on again after I had them off for a while. Once the earphones are on however, you’re transported into sound that is different that what you’ve experienced before. You can create different modes based on the occasion like relaxing, working out, etc… but for me, there’s only one mode I need, and that’s immersion. Switching between stereo, still, and immersion, I could tell the difference immediately. After hearing still and immersion, stereo sounds like I’m listening through a cheap pair of headphones. It’s that different. Still is good for those who want to sit and be “still.” Immersion makes you feel like you’re at a concert. The app has an EQ for you audiophiles that need to customize their sound. You can also set two shortcuts for either buttons. You can choose from a few options. I have one for siri, and the other for cycling through modes. I had the earphones on for about an hour, and they didn’t feel uncomfortable. Almost to a point that I forgot that I had them on. I don’t see anything mentioning them being water resistant or waterproof in any way, so I’m going to reason that they’re not IP68. That’s also disappointing considering these would be perfect to workout in without worrying that sweat will ruin them. Another thing that I miss is having a “find my earbuds” function. All in all the earphones take a while to get used to them, but once they’re on, it’s hard to go to other earphones. Bose has really done a great job with the Open Earbuds Ultra.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ll start off by saying that I am not a fan of most ear buds because having things in my ears hurts my ear canals after a while, so I personally prefer on-ear, over-ear, or open ear device alternatives. The Bose Ultra’s open ear design are truly unique in their execution and are comfortable to wear while providing a clean listening experience that still lets me be aware of my surroundings. These ear buds have an innovative wrap around design that hugs the outer ear just above the ear lobe, looking more like a cuff earring than a set of earphones. No part of it goes into your ear canal; instead the speaker is nestled in the groove of your ear and sound is directed into your ear canal at an upward angle. The fit of the ear buds is one-size, and the flexible soft silicone arm applies light but sufficient spring force to hold the barrel controller behind your ear. While that means there’s no way to customize the fit, you can adjust the positioning of the ear bud by slightly sliding it up or down to find the most comfortable position for you, however, I found that moving it can noticeably change the sound quality. To setup and pair with the ear buds, you’ll need to download and install the Bose Music app to your smart device. From there, setup was fairly straightforward and took only a few minutes. After pairing, you can listen to a demo track that showcase its “Immersive Audio” mode which has two settings, “Still” and “Motion.” These modes give the sound a sense of dimensional space, placing the sound in front of you with stereo separation. The difference between them is that with Still, the sound will project from a fixed location even as you turn your head; though note that if you face a different direction long enough, the spatial positioning will update and re-center on you. With Motion the sound follows you, so that it keeps its position relative to you which is better if you’ll be moving around a lot. You also have the option to turn immersive mode off (aka stereo mode), which can help extend battery life, but I found the sound to be a little flatter and confined to my headspace. The sound from these ear buds overall is pleasing and enveloping while still allowing you to hear other sounds in your environment. The audio is clean and clear with a light and airy quality, likely due to the open design. As for bass, it’s apparent but not overly pronounced. At moderate to low volume levels there’s virtually no sound bleeding, and folks standing a few feet from you won’t be able to hear what you’re listening to. However, when you turn up the volume it can get quite loud, and while you could effectively block out all other sounds, that sort of defeats the main benefit to having an open ear design. Plus, at higher volumes, sound can bleed quite a bit, making what you’re listening to perceptible to bystanders, and I feel the quality distorts with overly bright trebles and muddy midranges. One of the things that I liked about these is that when no audio is playing, the ear buds go silent and don’t produce any hiss of white noise during standby. The drawback is that it takes a split second for them to wake up, so notification sounds from your device may get slightly clipped. However, the low-latency 5.3 Bluetooth protocol also makes them great for watching video content with perfectly synced audio. These are slightly water resistant too, with an IPX4 rating, so would be fine for a sweaty workout and survive a drizzle. Each ear bud has a single physical click-button on the top of the barrel that wraps behind your ear. You need to press down on the button to use it as it is not a touch control. There are five key combinations for the controls including single, double, and triple clicks for play/pause and track skipping, as well as long-press (shortcut) and short press followed by a long press for volume control. The shortcut function can be customized to cycle through modes, immersive audio setting, source selection, or activate an AI voice assistant; you can perform different shortcut actions for the left and right ear buds. Listening modes are presets that you can select based on your environment and preference. The two pre-configured ones are simply Stereo and Immersion, though you can define up to eight custom modes, for example, for when you’re home, on a run, or during your commute. The only thing you’re really changing though is the Immersion mode and not a custom EQ profile. While you can adjust the bass, mid, and treble EQ by +/-10, these settings are global across modes. There are several pre-defined EQ adjustments like ‘bass boost’ and ‘treble reducer.’ You can also enable ‘auto-volume’ which will adjust the volume based on your surroundings, e.g. increase it when you’re in a noisy environment. When you take the ear buds out of the case they will announce the battery life remaining as a percentage. You can also view the battery life for each ear bud in the app. The total runtime is advertised at around 7.5 hours on a full charge depending on your listening volume and settings; just note that time will be shorter when you have immersive modes enabled. The included USB-C charging case can deliver up to an additional 19.5 hours of playtime or about 2.5 full charges on-the-go. It charges the ear buds quickly, and they went from 70% to full in just 15 minutes. However, the case itself cannot be charged wirelessly. Each ear bud has two microphones on it that are used for hands-free calls, interacting with your voice assistant, and auto-volume adjustments. On calls, these mics picked up my voice clearly and the other party had no trouble hearing me, though note that in a loud setting you may sound more faint. Also be aware that the open ear design can feel distracting during a call in crowded spaces as I found it hard to differentiate the call audio from people talking around me. Overall, the audio performance from these open-ear ear buds is enjoyable and just about as clear as you can get without having anything stuck in your ears. Hands-free calls have acceptable quality but are best in quiet spaces. You won’t have to take them out to hear what’s going on around you, and the spatial imaging of the Immersive modes is a neat feature. The battery life is ok for true wireless ear buds and with the case and a few short charging breaks can get you through an entire day of use. I found them more comfortable than traditional ear buds over long listening sessions, though if you do start to feel the pressure on the back of your ear, you can simply slide the ear piece a bit for some relief.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased the Bose ultra earbuds about three weeks ago and overall, I’m very happy with them. They’re extremely comfortable, and very easy to put on and take off. The connection between the front and back of the earbuds is made of an elastic material so they are never too tight. The quality of the sound is excellent. The highs come through nicely, which usually isn’t a problem for this type of earbud, but what stands out is that the base is nice and full. The only criticism I have is that I wish they were a bit louder. I frequently find myself listening to them at maximum volume. That is the only reason I gave him four stars instead of five. But I have no issue recommending them.']"
JBL Quantum 610 Wireless Gaming Headset - Black,$199.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-quantum-610-wireless-gaming-headset-black/15956941/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My old headset was big, heavy and gave me a head ache after long gaming sessions. My new JBL head set is very comfortable, surprisingly light and not so cumbersome. I love how the mic boom folds up and automatically mutes the mic. Lets be honest, sometimes we cant break for food and might eat and game at the same time. The last thing you want is to be chewing or crunching in someones ear. The mic simply folds up, mutes and gets out of the way for your next window to scarf some pizza - LOL! The only negative i can see from this set is that JBL still doesnt have the ability with the USB dongle to work with the XBOX. Hopefully soon in the future.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JBL quantum headphones are GREAT! What is great about these headphones is that you can connect wireless or wired. Had to use wired to connect to XBOX but play station can connect wirelessly. These headphones are very easy to use and connect. The microphone picks up well and the mute function is great, either push mic up or hit button on headphones. The sound quality and volume are awesome as well. The sound quality makes you feel like you are in the game. You can use headphones while they are charging as well. JBL lights up on the side which looks great. Battery life is well over 12 hours. This is yet another great product from JBL. The comfort of these headphones is great. The foam material and coverings feel great. I can easily wear these for hours at a time. Would highly recommend these JBL quantum headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Looking for a headset for me PS5. Easy set up just plug the dongle in one of your usb ports. I did go to my setting on my PS5 to tweak it a bit. It does support DTS 2.0 and it did sound better when I changed it. Very comfortable and stylish as usually expected from JBL. Some Pros, great for PC gamming. Plug in the usb there was a firmware upgrade, it down loaded the software. The interface is very retro and self explanatory. Love the mood lighting on the sides and how you have modes you can play around with. Easy mute with just lifting the boom. It really gives you 3d sound and you can test it out on your PC. Some Cons, No wifi connection with Xbox or Switch. I am a gamer and would love to just move the usb from one console to another. You have to use the 3.5 mil cord to plug into the controller for it to work. It does come with all the cords needed (See Pics). Nice overall just looking for more updated options. No support of Dolby or higher DTS. Kind of a bummer no Bluetooth.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I didn't know what to expect about this wireless headset when I first got them but let me tell you that they met my expectations! I have large ears and the fit was great, my ears didn't stick outside the ear cups and have no discomfort even while wearing glasses. I did notice that the ear cup material got a bit hot after about an hour of use but nothing too bad. USB and 3.5 mm cable are super easy to set up, had no issues setting up the headphones to my PS5 using USB or my Switch and Xbox Series X with the 3.5 mm cable. Audio is loud and super crisp! Has good bass and mids are very detailed, had no issues with competitive games like Call of Duty Warzone. The ear cups swivel around to lay flat on my chest when I'm wearing them around my neck. The JBL logo lights up when the headset is ON and this is a nice addition specially when gaming in a dark room even if you can't see the glow, my son loves watching play since the lights keep changing between blue, white and purples tones. The included bag was a nice little bonus since I'm always looking for a place to keep my headsets safe and free from dust when I'm not wearing them. The mic worked great with the included windscreen. My buddies over voice chat were able to hear me loud and clear even while gaming under a ceiling fan. Muting audio doesn't get any easier than flipping the boom stick upwards. This wireless headset has a good weight to it and they feel premium. JBL definitely has a good product here, very happy with it!"", 'I absolutely recommend the JBL Quantum 610 Wireless headphones to any kind of passionate (online)gamer. Long lasting battery (lastedün about several days of permanent use). The earpads have a pretty nice depth and a total comfy cushioning as well. The mic is movable and works as you would expect it to work: Perfectly! My favorite feature is the mute switch right next to the mic for when getting angry :D I have used and tested them with our computer, PS4 and Nintendo Switch. Overall the best gaming headphones i‘ve got to use. Go get them!!! :)', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Quantum 610 wireless gaming is an great gaming or zoom call headset. These are well built, light but very sturdy. The headset is boxed very nicely and protected from damages during shipping. After removing the headset from the box, I quickly could tell the quality of the headset. Once I did a preliminary fit I immediately noticed the ear cups are too shallow. I have medium size ears and my ears were resting on the speaker casing. I also noticed how long the ear cup cables were...they could be shortened and concealed to look more sleek. The padding around the ears and the top of the head are very soft...cushiony for the lightness of the headset. The mouth boom is awesome. Easy on/off voice feature allows tilting the boom up so no one can hear you talk. It is the right length and it does an superb job on now allowing exterior noises to be heard...no exterior feedback when the mic is on. If the mouth boom was removable, that would be so nice! My second complaint besides the shallow ear cups is the dongle you have to use for wireless connectivity. Lets say you game off of an iPhone... be prepared to buy another dongle to connect to your iPhone where the JBL dongle will connect too. I am an android user so no issues gaming off my phone with this headset, but my daughter has the newest iPhone and the USB dongle doesn't fit the USB C slot of her iPhone. Once you turn the headset on, it came charged, the ear cup JBL logo lights up with a subtle blue and alternating purple color... giving the headset a more expensive look. If the JBL logo colors aren't to your liking, it can be turned off. The software is easy to follow and use. What really surprised me and put a smile on my face is the sound. These speakers sound clear, crisp, and the noise cancellation is incredible. The bass you get along with the highs was just incredible...seriously, a great listening experience. If these were Bluetooth, the boom could be removed, ear cups made a tad deeper, and came with a dongle for iPhone gaming, this headset would get 5 stars and would be my go to for gaming and on the go work-out, headset of choice. For now they will serve the purpose for my zoom calls and some gaming. I may be nit picking the Quantum 610 headset because it's a quality headset at a very good price!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Quantum 610 gaming headset achieves everything is trying to accomplish with no major drawbacks. Unboxing it, the headset has a nice presentation, great materials and it's packaged well in a cloth bag. It comes with the usb dongle, usb-c charging cable, 3.5mm cable and paperwork. My experience in windows 10 was plug and play, though I already had the JBL Quantum Engine software installed. It identified the headset, updated the Quantum Engine and I was ready to go. My headset was fully charged in a less than an hour, though I've read it takes three hours to fully charge from zero. Battery life is stated to be 40 hours, and that is consistent with what I've seen. If the battery does run out, you can still use it while charging. The headset is super comfortable, with a thick pad on your head and very squishy ear cups. I never had that achy feeling across my dome or sore ears after an all nighter. The microphone is not removable, but it rotates up and down and bends and holds if you need to adjust it or move it out of the way. I like the included sidetalk feature to hear yourself in the headset. The mic functions beautifully, it captures my voice loudly and resonantly but if a sound is just a few inches further away, it's not picked up. Comparing this headset to my Quantum One, there are two stark differences (other than the fact that the One is corded). The first is that the 610 has no noise cancelling. Now for me, gaming alone in my basement, I don't miss that feature at all. But if you're in a gaming center or with a group, or game on the go, you may want to spend just a bit more for the 810 model, which has active noise cancelling. The second big difference is the sound quality. This is the only place where the 610 shows why it's half the price of the One. I found the sound enjoyable, but very bass heavy. Using the equalizer helps this, but there's also a little muddiness in the sound.. with music or movies, highs and lows get a little lost together. Where the two headsets agree is on surround sound and positionality. Movies in DTS present allllmost as good a sound field as my 7.1 Atmos home theater. In gaming, I can easily tell where footsteps, gun shots, etc are coming from. Overall this is an easy to use, long lasting, super comfortable headset. The controls are good and the software is robust. If you need ANC, or you're an audiophile who wants to also use these for music and movies, I'd like to spend a little more."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound: Headphones sound great. I don\'t think it has that true JBL Signature Sound like other non-gaming JBL headphones but for a gaming headset, these are quite good, especially with the surround sound experience (the 50mm drivers make a good impact). The Equalizer in the JBL PC software also adds a lot of quality to the headset as well. Lows, mids, and highs are all adjustable. In addition, there\'s also a spatial sound section/feature where it adds echo and reverb to the sound like it\'s coming from the ""space"". The effect is customizable from the software with advanced options and sliders. It\'s similar to a live concert experience which I thought was cool for some songs and games. The headset is quite loud and the earcups also seal the ear very tightly to create solid insolation. I also didn\'t get any lag with the wireless feature which was very enjoyable to see. Microphone: I love the ""flip-up to mute"" feature. It comes in handy during gaming or chatting/video calling sessions when you immediately want to mute. The small red LED light is also well-thought and placed. However, if you are using the headset wired, when you flip the mute switch on the cable, the light on the microphone doesn\'t turn red. It\'s visible in the software but would\'ve been nice to add that little touch with the LED light. Overall, it sounds clear, I had no issues with the sound or got complaints about the audio from the other side. The mic is also flexible and once I was told that I was too loud, I simply moved it away from my mouth to a more comfortable spot. The mic looks like it would only move in only one direction from photos but it\'s very adjustable and easy to use. There\'s a microphone section in the software as well. ""Mic Level"", ""Mic Volume"", and ""Sidetone"" could be all adjusted from the software with sliders in order to get the best out of the mic. On-headphone control buttons: I loved the buttons and their placements on the headset. They weren\'t in accidentally pressing areas with my usage. The right earcup only has the iconic JBL on/off flip switch for Bluetooth use. The left earcup has the volume + game-chat dial and the mute button. The game-chat dial is very convenient, and switching between the game/video sound to the chat room effortlessly was game-changing. Although the dials are smooth, they were still firm enough to not move or change settings with head movements. Fit/Comfort: The earcup pads and the headband are very soft and comfortable for long uses. The headset is flexible and I didn\'t have any comfort issues. The only negative factor I came across was the headband adjustment levels. If a headset has 10 adjustable levels I\'m usually at the 6/7th level which still leaves some room at the top. However, with this pair, I maxed it out. I don\'t have a large head but someone with one might find this pair a bit uncomfortable with the pressure coming down the headband. Other than that, the headset is very comfortable and although it\'s a bit on the heavy side, the weight didn\'t bother me at all. I enjoyed the freedom of no cables and the battery lasted for quite a while. JBL Quantum Engine PC Software: The software is great and I loved using it. It would\'ve been nice if it had a different layout and user interface options but it gets the job done. I love customizing my products and the software provides just that. The RGB JBL logos on the earcups can also light up with effects. There are ""Breathing"", ""Solid"", ""Wave"", and ""Glitch"" effects available in the software. You can link any effect to any color and pretty much create your own light artwork and change the colors depending on your setup, game, mood, etc. The software is very easy to use and it definitely enhances the performance you would get from the headset. Overall, I would recommend this headset to gamers. Compared to other headsets in this price range, this pair has a lot to offer anywhere from customizability to the wireless connection. Everyone has different needs, of course, but for what I look for in a gaming headset, this satisfies most of the factors. ', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Disclaimer: I am NOT a regular gamer. I just want to make that perfectly clear as this review just so happens to be for the JBL Quantum 610 Wireless headset - a headset designed and built specifically for gamers. ""Why did I get them"", you ask? Well, simply put... I love JBL/Harman products. I\'ve used several of their speakers, earbuds and headphones over the last few years which I\'ve been impressed with the sound and I\'ve had interest in one day getting more into gaming, so I figured why not try a brand that I trust for my first gamer headset rather than taking a chance on a brand I\'m unfamiliar with. So... just so I\'m transparent: my review as follows is based solely on my impression of this JBL Quantum 610 Wireless headset - the very first (and only) headset I\'ve ever experienced. So, after unboxing this pair and trying them on, my first impression was these are comfortable. I consider them to be lightweight; they\'re definitely not heavy, so they don\'t feel like weights on your head. They have really soft cushion which I liked as it was comfortable to my head and ears. They\'re not noise-canceling, so with them on and no sound coming through, you can hear other sounds in your environment moderately well. Included in the box is a 3.5 mm aux cord, a USB type-A charging cable, and a USB Bluetooth wireless adapter. Anxious to get an idea of the sound, I took an unconventional approach for such a headset by first testing the sound like a would a normal pair of headphones. My hearing skills when listening to music through a new pair of headphones gives me a general idea of how I feel about the sound and the headphones themself, so I plugged in the aux cord to my Android phone (where I normally use to listen to music through my JBL Club 950NC headphones) and I played music familiar to me to get an idea. I quickly learned that these are not designed for recreational music listening. At least not in my opinion. The sound was so far different than I could have imagined in areas like mid-range, bass, presence and tone. The volume at max level also sounds to be significantly lower than my experience with my other JBL headphones. There was, however, one cool thing that I enjoyed while testing these on music and that was the ""QuantumSound"" surround sound. They give off a great ambience with music coming through in surround sound, which I learned later compliments video game playing that uses background music. For the surround sound, I give it a 9 out of 10. After testing it out by listening to a couple of songs, I decided that my next test for it should be on my computer via Zoom. I did this using the USB type-A cable which my computer picked up with in very quick time with no trouble whatsoever. I began a Zoom call with a friend and, after having some difficulty on my end getting Zoom to use the JBL headset as my sound device vs my webcam mic, my friend was able to hear me loud and clear. I, too, could hear them well and the sound I felt was pretty decent - not knowing what to expect chat-wise, of course. For my final test, I decided to take this headset to where it belongs - connected via a game system. I used the aux cable to plug into my PS4 controller while playing Madden \'21. As stated above, I\'m not a big gamer, though I do have a few games. I went with Madden because of it\'s use of music, crowd ambiance, controller button sound fx, commentator dialogue and, of course, football sound fx. Here is where it all began to makee sense to me - the volume and the surround sound. Unfortunately, I\'ve never played online with anyone, so I was not able to chat using the built-in mic during gameplay - but sound-wise, I was able to enjoy this headset more now than before. The music during the game settings screen sounded good (I\'m not sure if the games\' developers mix or EQ the music for video games differently than commercially released music, but nonetheless - it sounded good). The crowd had a wide stereo sound that game the gameplay a great feel because of the headset\'s surround sound. The commentators sounded clear with great presence, and the sound fx of the football being caught and players tackling one another sounded really good. It wasn\'t until this moment that I appreciated that the volume of the headset wasn\'t louder, as I initially thought it was low while first listening to music from my phone. I think the volume is good at max level for gameplay (and yes, I did check the settings on my PS4 to ensure that I had it at max level directly from the settings) so that when gamers are playing, it\'s not so loud that the entire house could burn down without them hearing noise outside of the headset. I was still able to hear my family speaking around me, although I would occasionally have to pull the headset back off of one ear to hear them clearly. Considering this was my first experience hearing a gaming headset, I\'d give the Quantum 610 Wireless a 9 out of 10. I still think a little bit of a boost of mid-range and high-end could enhance the sound just a bit more. Lastly since I hadn\'t mentioned it yet, the buttons, switch and volume dial on the aux cable and headset are pretty straightforward. With just the push of a button on the headset (or a flip of the switch on the aux cable), you can quickly mute your mic. I tested this out during my Zoom call and it worked as designed. You can also just flip the mic-piece upward for it to mute and you will see a red light indicator near the tip of the mic indicating that you\'re on mute. There\'s a volume dial on both the headset and aux cable, as well as a chat/audio balance dial on the headset only. Oh yeah, when connected via Bluetooth, the JBL logo on the outside of each ear of the headset glows a few different colors which looks pretty cool, too. All-in-all, I\'d give these a 9.8 out of 10. I can\'t think of much of anything that I feel like they\'re lacking and honestly, because I have no other headset to compare them to, I\'m not sure if these average or above average. My experience with JBL, however, won\'t allow me to even entertain the thought that they could possibly be below average - that\'s just silly talk! Lol. JBL - thank you, as always, for consistently designing and delivering your fans and supporters quality sound a grade-A experience every time. You guys ROCK!', 'We used the headphones with the online game ""Final Fantasy XIV"" and also connected them to the Nintendo Switch. There, however, with a cable because the switch does not support the dongle. The 50 mm driver ensures real gaming enjoyment. The flip-up boom mic is great. The other players can hear you clearly and if you don\'t use it, simply fold it up. That was also the very big advantage when working from home. Conferences and calls were super convenient. The headphones sit very well on the ear cups. There is no need to press the button to disrupt the often long conferences. However, it does get very warm under the upholstery after a while.This is not so pleasant for long conversations. You start to sweat. Also the weight is only 357 g but after a while they feel really heavy. For example, if it\'s just a training session, you simply fold the microphone away. Enjoying music is also great with it. The sound is great. Controlling the volume is super easy and convenient. All controls are on the left ear. Volume and mood can be adjusted here. When operated with a cable, there is also a convenient control directly on the cable. The battery life keeps what the manufacturer promises. Long gaming fun and/or long office weeks are covered with one charge. The manufacturer promises 40 hours. And that at 2.4 GHz. After 41 hours, the headphones ran out of battery charge. But with the ability to connect the USB cable during operation, gaming and work does not have to be interrupted. And after 3 hours of charging, it is already fully charged again. A great gimmick is the lighting of the JBL logo on the headphones. The writing glows in different colors. Nice to watch. The small storage bag is a nice accessory. The ear cups can be folded down. So you can simply put the headset on the table. At the end we are very happy with the Quantum 610 over-ear gaming headset. Sound and speech reproduction are great. Build and quality appear solid and feel good. The controls and microphone are thoughtfully placed and great in action. The battery easily lasts the specified time and without loss of performance. The loading time is very fast and ideal for taking a break. Seat and fit of the ear cups are comfortable and exclude background noise very well. Flexible application options thanks to dongle or cable. Depending on the possibility. The big advantage is clearly the wireless capability. Great for gaming enjoyment and freedom of movement without the hassle of a cable. The still high weight and the accumulated heat under the ear pads are not so great. Nevertheless, a great headset that qualifies for all gamers who want to have fun.']"

I would say they have about average sound quality, about everything you'd expect from a $10-$20 range pair of headphones really. The things that puts it over the top for me is the funky shaped earbud covers, they just fit in my ears like a dream. They don't hurt or pinch or fall out like all other earbuds do for me. I guess I have smaller ear canals or something, I don't know, but earbuds are just always a pain and I can never get them to stay in. These do the trick and comfortably stay in, even when I'm outside doing yardwork or jogging. I highly recommend these puppies to anyone, but especially anyone who has the same issues with typical earbuds like I do."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Better than Sony or others. The best I've purchased. I thought I have problem with my small radio and looking for another one but it would cost me a lot. I purchased this item and I was surprised to know that the problem was the earbud I was using, Sony. This fit exactly inside your ear which I like because I use my radio and set it to timer and this earbud doesn't get undone. Truly an excellent value if you are looking for one, either for active activities such as walking, jogging etc or for passive like listening to the radio while you are trying to catch a nap or sleep."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For years, I could not find earbuds that would stay in, and if they did, they hurt. I finally splurged and bought an expensive pair of Bose that stayed but they often made my ears itch. I put up with that, but after exactly one year, they died! Very disappointing, so I decided to look for something cheap and comfortable. I've had these for 3 weeks and so far they are great--the sound is good, they stay put, and they are very comfortable. If they die in a year, I won't feel bad because I didn't spend much. I just ordered another pair, in white, even less $."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are perfect for traveling have good audio.

These fit the bill so I picked them up and I'm glad I did. I can enjoy my PS4 or some music while my toddler sleeps, and it drowns out most the ambient noise. It leaves just enough noise incoming that I can still hear when my kiddo wakes up though. I fully plan on buying another pair - best in ear headphones I've ever used."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Theyre decent overall- my biggest problem with them is that the audio randomly becomes very 'scratchy.'

First time end up as two different devices so iw asnt able to pair both on the same pairing channel.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ----- SUMMARY ----- Verdict: The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds have impressed me with their active noise cancellation and “Hear-Thru” modes which both work very well. Couple that with their sleek and comfortable design, along with the great sound and mic quality, and you have a solid pair of earbuds. If you’re looking for wireless earbuds in this price range, these are definitely ones to consider. Pros: - Completely wireless - Comfortable and appealing design - Noise cancellation works well - Great sound quality - Clear phone calls - Sweat/water resistant - Good battery life Cons: - No companion app with EQ settings ----- DETAILS ----- Design & Comfort: The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds offer a completely wireless experience. Not only are the earbuds wireless, but the charging case also (with a Qi-capable charging pad). It’s convenient since I don’t have to worry about having a cable on hand. There’s a USB-C charging cable included in the box though. The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds and the case are sleek-looking and small, so they’re portable and aesthetically appealing. I’ve worn them while doing various daily tasks, including workouts, and I’ve found that they stay in my ears well and are comfortable. There are no buttons on the earbuds. Instead, touch control on each earbud allows you to play/pause songs, go to the next song or back a song, answer a call or hang up, decline a call, and activate your phone’s voice assistant. All of these are based on how many times you tap the earbud, or in some cases tap and hold for two seconds. These controls are outlined in the included quick start guide. Features & Performance: As in their name, the SOUNDFORM Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds have active noise cancellation (ANC) technology to block outside noise. I like having these earbuds with me in situations like traveling on a plane or visiting a coffee shop to get some work done. The earbuds effectively limit outside noise so that I can relax or focus. There are also situations when I want to be more aware of my surroundings, such as crossing a busy street, and that’s when the “Hear-Thru” mode comes in handy. It has the opposite effect of ANC, amplifying outside noise. Whether you're trying to limit outside noise with ANC or amplify it with “Hear-Thru”, each mode works very well. The SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds are fantastic for phone calls. There’s dual beamforming technology in the earbuds that picks up your voice clearly. I’ve asked family members on calls how I sounded and they commented on the quality. I was especially impressed when I was outside walking near a busy street and they said they could still hear me clearly. The sound quality of these earbuds impressed me as well. I’d describe the sound as crisp but with a good amount of bass. You can hear the instruments clearly, and there’s a noticeable difference between the lows, mids, and highs. When I tried several music genres, they all sounded great. However, I wish there was a companion app where you could customize the EQ settings. Because they’re IPX5-rated sweat and water-resistant, the SOUNDFORM Flow earbuds can endure sweat and rain. This was an important feature to me because I wanted to use the earbuds for workouts. The sweat resistance and great sound quality have made these earbuds my new favorites for workouts. In terms of battery life, you can expect about 31 hours, which is true to what Belkin advertises. The earbuds provide about 7 hours, and the case provides an additional 24 hours of power. ----- WHAT’S IN THE BOX ----- 1 x SOUNDFORM Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds 1 x Qi Charging Case 3 x Pairs Silicone Ear Tips 1 x USB-C Charging Cable 1 x Quick Start Guide"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wanted to get new bluetooth earbuds because I want to go workout but I don't want to have cable. These are absolutely beautiful. The sound quality is outstanding and the design is very sleek and modern. They fit very well to my ear and even when I'm working out, running and jumping they stay at place and doesn't move or fall out of my ear. I really like the white color and the way how they look. The noise canceling function works perfect so you can easily hear your music in loud back round. I would definitely recommend these earbuds! It's great product."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The SoundForm Flow Noise Cancelling Earbuds are amazing quality at a great price. The case they come in is very user friendly and stylish. The earbuds are true in the fact, they cancel out surrounding noise very well. The sound quality is top of the line and has great bass. I love the fact that a quick 10 minute charge gives me an hour or more of playtime. They are water resistant which is a must for great buds. They do come with a charge cable and different size cushions. These earbuds are quite durable and have such great performance. I highly recommend these earbuds for casual listening and active users alike.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds really are noise cancelling. I tried them during a kids’ party near my house and I was able to work peacefully with some music. I appreciate the earbuds come in multiple colors, including black to match my phone case. The earbuds also come with additional ear tips in three sizes. I have small ears and have trouble keeping wireless earbuds in my ears comfortable. I used the small size and the fit great and were comfortable. I prefer the soft ear tips for comfort compared to other earbud options without. I tried these during a work out and they only fell out once, which I felt was a win. I still worry about loosing them, but can definitely say these fit better. The box comes with charging cable (but not plug adapter) so you can plug them in a computer or use your own usb plug adapter. The part I liked best is that you can actually use a wireless charger and place a case right on the charging pad. The charging indicator light is also helpful to know how charged the earbuds are with 3 settings 100%-75% is white, 50% is orange, and <25% is red. They were really easy to connect to my phone and tablet. I think these earbuds are a great option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall I thought these headphones were nice and good quality. They remind me a lot of the Apple Airpods but I find these to be more comfortable with the inner ear piece. They connected to my phone very easily and was able to start listening to them from opening the box to music playing in my ears in less than 5 minutes. Two small things that I found that could be improved was that the case closes easily after opening. It needs to be fully open in order to stay open and if touched will close. Additionally, when changing from ANC to having other sounds, it only beeps. I wish it would tell you which mode you were in to make it obvious.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have tried a few different pairs of wireless earbuds and these win in terms of sound quality and call quality. My friend said he didn't realize I was on a walk outside because the audio was so crisp and clear. The earbuds come with 3 different sizes of ear tips you can find the perfect fit, which will help with noise cancellation. The product is well made and even has Active Noise Cancellation, which is a feature you typically find in higher end headphones. As this is a new product, there is some clear room for improvement, but none of these things are dealbreakers: - The headphones offer 3 modes of noise cancellation: off, passthrough, and ANC. However, when you switch between these three modes by tapping your finger on the left earbud, you hear a sound effect to indicate that you have switched modes. The problem is, you don't actually know what mode you've switched to as it doesn't say. - The earbuds do not have a companion app unlike some other Belkin earbuds, which means you cannot adjust EQ settings, see the current noise cancellation mode, or even see the battery level of the charging case. While there are different coloured LED lights on the case and earbuds themselves to indicate charge level, I am colourblind and cannot tell the difference between the green and orange lights. Overall, these are fantastic earbuds for the price and the addition of ANC is a welcome feature! Best of all, they sound fantastic on calls and I had no complaints when I was on the phone with my friends."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These noise cancelling headphones lived up to my expectations! The quality of sound is amazing! They come with 3 different earbud sizing, small, medium and large. The small fit me best, leaving the earbuds snug in my ear. I love the charging case. They case stayed charged for at-least a day and the headphone charged very quickly (roughly 10 mins for at-least a 60/min). After each use I place them back in their case so they’re all charged for my next workout! They’re lightweight, easy to use, and very well made! They’ve held up extremely well while sweating at the gym as well! I love these headphones and overall extremely please with the sound quality and durability!', ""Each ear bud is connecting independently to any phone I connect to. I can't listen to music with both ear buds at the same time. This is very frustrating. I was hoping for a firmware update that might resolve this, but none have been released since February 2024. I reached out to support, and was asked to replace my earbuds. However, I bought the ear buds in a duty free shop and I can't replace them at that store since it's in another country."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These seem to be a solidly build pair of wireless ear buds with quality materials.

I have so far used these for about 6 hours in a row and had to problem with holding a charge that long. The sound quality is nice, but the part where I'd say these ear buds excel is their noise canceling. These are a nice set of ear buds that hold up to your needs.""]"

Placing earpieces in your ear like the pro flight series 2, or carrying around their larger over ear aviation headset is inconvenient for most professional pilots.

But the microphone and the sound quality are infinitely better in the Bose. It’s fairly comfortable, the ear pieces do hurt my ear after prolonged use but maybe that’s something to which I’ll get accustomed. The headset quality seems fantastic.

If your ears opening is not small like mine (or your not irritated by foam plugs or thing in your ears) you will love this headset. Just wish they would have been cofortable to me, I would have kept them. I'm back to my Bose A20's."", 'The pro flight 2 is light weight, comfortable and perfect to use to long flights. I have been using the headset in a Hawker 900XP for approx 2 months now. The sound quality is great & the noise cancelling is excellent, with the ability to double tap an ear piece to turn of noise cancelling on one ear piece being particularly useful. Changing the mic from left side to right side is a little finicky if swapping seats and the mic arm is slightly in the peripheral which can be annoying at first but I quickly adjusted. Overall the product seems well made and durable, I would recommend it to a friend.', ""Have to start by saying that I haven't flown with an over the top headset or ANR in my 30 years of flying. That said, they are good. ANR seems to be very good. Sound is also very good. My main issue is with pressure points. There three points where the headset makes contact with you. I find myself adjusting it frequently. The other pressure points are in the ears. The ear buds are oval in shape which I believe is the cause of my hot-spots. I'm constantly adjusting them in my ears. To be up front, I've been flying with an earbud heads for about 13 yaers without this problem. The last issue I have is with the battery life. They don't last very long if you don't have the ship powered headset."", 'Love my new Bose Proflight 2’s! They’re lightweight, compact, comfortable, and the functions are great. I like to use the noise cancelling on medium setting, so that I can still hear the airplane, but it makes listening to radio calls much easier.', 'The audio quality is just not as good as other Bose products.', 'I’ve been an aviation Bose user for a long time. Starting with the Bose X to A20 to the first version of the ProFlight and now Proflight 2.0. I could only stand the original Proflight for about an hour as the huge cord constantly pulled and the headset off my head. But with the thinner and lighter cord of version 2.0 it’s so much better. Great not having huge cups covering my hears, plus being able to wear sunglasses without any pressure. Bose thanks for updating and refining, have always loved your products and customer support/service.', 'I’ve been a Bose Aviation headset user for a number of years now and couldn’t be happier with the ProFlight Series 2! The A20 was perfect for my days in the King Air but found them to be a little cumbersome while in the quieter environment of a jet’s flightdeck. The PFS2 is lighter than the first installment and the cord is much more flexible, permitting easy adjustment. I also found that wearing sunglasses with over-ear headsets became awkward and painful after a few hours. I give the Bose ProFlight Series 2 5 stars!!']"

JBL Tune 520BT On-Ear Sound Isolating Bluetooth Headphones - White,$49.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-tune-520bt-on-ear-sound-isolating-bluetooth-headphones-white/17857924/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Another great product from JBL. JBL Tune 520BT Headphones are very well designed and simple to use. Very well packaged as well as graphics on box. The moment I unboxed I realized these were solidly built and designed which I am accustomed to from JBL. Packaging was on point with a quick and easy setup manual. Headphones were charged and ready go right out of the box. Easy to setup and connect to blue tooth. The Tune 520BT sound was very good from a basic easy to use headphones. They seemed to block out surrounding noise. I would like to try on a flight and see how they perform. I definitely believe if your looking for well priced and easy to use headphones with good build and sound quality these are a no brainer. The only negative is I wish they came with a better storage bag or case for protection when not in use or putting them in a book bag. These would be great for kids and teens. I definitely will use as my go to headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound on these headphones are absolutely amazing! Such great quality! The amount of time the battery last for is great too! Charging doesn't take too long and is easy to do. Connecting to Bluetooth is simple. The only thing I could see as a downfall is some people may not like the size of the ear pieces. They are on the smaller size."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones for music high on bass the app is a plus you have control over your settings at any time this is a very cool tool Seems like is a noise canceling headphones because I can’t hear outside noise even on low volume', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used these headphones for a few days now and for the price, I am very impressed. Decent padding on the top and ears. I can wear them comfortably for hours. The blue tooth range is good because I move from rooms to rooms without disconnection (upstairs) If I go down stairs, I lost connection. The sound is better than I expected for the price. Lyrics are clear and base is deep. The ability to connect the JBL Tune 520 BT to multiple devices simultaneously, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, makes my lives a lot easier because I connect them with my work computer and my phone. The only complaint I have is the charging cable is a bit too short.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using this JBL Tune 520 BT headphones for about 10 days. So far the best for the price in terms of build quality, sound quality, features and options it has. The box is included with the cable for charging. The best part is it has a JBL app supporting these headphones using which we can customize some of the settings and the setup is very easy. Coming to wearing it for a longer time is also good without any complaints with its long-lasting battery and feather kind of light weight. Coming to sound quality and bass is great for the price. It has the option of a multipoint connection, like connecting to 2 devices at a time and switching between them, but I found it a little hard to switch and there was no clear info about it. Other than that, the rest of the things are absolutely great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around experience. I enjoy using these headphones while in the office or chores around the house. They block out just enough sound without making me feel like I am missing anything going on around me. Very easy to connect to my phone and computer. The sound quality has been perfect for both music and podcasts. They are a good weight to where I do not feel bogged down while wearing. I look forward to using these when I need a little me time in the office.', ""The JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones are the best headphones I've had so far, the sound quality is sensational and they soundproof perfectly. They have a built-in microphone and volume control in the earpiece, which is very convenient to use. These are wireless earphones that connect via Bluetooth, and additionally work with the Google Assistant, so you can control them with your phone using voice commands. They last over 50 hours on a single charge and can be connected to a phone and a laptop at the same time. They are very comfortable to use - they have soft inserts and a headband with a large range of adjustment, and the headphones are foldable, thanks to which they can be easily packed into a purse or backpack. I use headphones every day to listen to music, give tutoring or talk on the phone and in each of these options they work great. Sometimes even children use them when they want to listen to their favorite children's songs and they are also delighted. I highly recommend :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tune 520 are over-ear headphones, made of plastic with faux-leather earcups. Like I said they’re very lightweight and the earcup padding is plush, but the clamping force is pretty high so those with larger heads (like me) will be uncomfortable after even a moderate listening session. Those with normal-sized heads might feel differently. Overall, the construction seems pretty good. The controls on the 520 are straightforward and similar to other JBL units. There are buttons on the right ear cup to help you turn the phones on and off, adjust volume, skip tracks forward and backwards, play/pause audio. The power button is also used for Bluetooth, and the upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 is a nice addition. The headphones support multi-point connection, which means that they can connect to two devices. Charging is handled by USB-C. You can also adjust the equalization using the JBL Headphones app. The 520s delivered very balanced sound out of the box. It was extremely flat, but connecting to the app allows you to tailor them to your liking. Stereo separation is great and the bass extension in the app provides a ton of punch. It took me a little while, but I was able to get the equalizer set to my liking. Bottom line: The JBL Tune 520 are a nice way to break into JBL headphones. They’re super lightweight, the battery life is tremendous, and if you like bass you’ll love these headphones. The ability to tailor the sound using JBL’s app (which I really like) is a big plus for headphones in this price range. You just better have a smaller head.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable, crisp, light weight and sleek. I like how they aren't bulky, I don't feel like they are wearing me..simple buttons with function. They are very comfortable on my ears for hours. They definitely have good bass sound for my daily tracks I wouldn't recommend for a bass enthusiast but they do enhance the bass in my tracks to make it sound crisp."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Starting off, the packaging is perfectly done with a good presentation. It’s strait to the point while keeping wasteful extras to a minimum. The build quality, this is something that is super important with headphones intended to be used every day. After vigorously testing and using these over a week, there is no apparent weakness and these are very well made while maintaining a super light weight. The adjustments above the ear cups are the only gripe found with these but once set in a comfortable spot they seem to stay there. Now, the most important part, the sound quality. As expected from JBL, the sound signature is near perfect strait out of the box. There is adjustable EQ capabilities on the app which brings the headphones to a new level. Punchy lows and crispy highs, these keep your tunes fresh for hours on end. The extremely respectable battery life on these outshine any others. I forgot to even charge these for the majority of the time using them so far. To finalize this, I can say without a doubt, these are a smart purchase for any average listener or school goers who need an extra upgrade in sound. I wouldn’t recommend these for any heavy movement activities but they do stay in place pretty well.']"
"CORSAIR - HS Series HS55 Wireless Gaming Headset for PC, PS5, and Mobile - White",$239.25,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/corsair-hs-series-hs55-wireless-gaming-headset-for-pc-ps5-and-mobile-white/17498136/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair HS55 is an overall great option for anyone looking to move on to a wireless gaming headset. I feel that this headset offers a great value of features for the price compared to other headsets currently available. The HS55 offers premium construction quality and comfort, 50 foot wireless range, is lightweight, has a solid battery life, charges fast, and offers Dolby Audio 7.1 Surround Sound on PC and Mac. It is also advertised to work on the PS4 and PS5, although I just tested it out for a few days on my PC. On the headset itself, there are various buttons, such as a mute button for the microphone (which also mutes when flipped up), a volume wheel, a bluetooth button, and of course the power button. For those using this headset on a PC, you are able to tune the sound much better in the iCue software. I personally did not like the sound much straight out of the box, but after using the EQ in the iCue software, I was able to tweak it to my liking and update the firmware. The microphone itself isn't the best, but no headset microphone really is. I would have liked to see the microphone be detachable as I've seen a few headsets that offer that, but in the end it's not that big of a deal. Overall though, I did like this headset and could easily see myself using it as a daily option. I think that for most people, it fits practically every need and comes in at a good price point. I would probably pair it with a dedicated microphone, but for those that can't, the included microphone will get the job done."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Corsair HS55 wireless gaming headset built with premium quality and perfect for multi-use that looks great. I have the white model. It comes in a nice colorful package with a wireless receiver usb dongle and a usb cable for charging and to connect to some gaming platforms. No user manual was provided but it is available online. Charging is fast; I’ve been using a 2.4A connection since it didn’t come with a charger. Out of the box, the headset is ready use either with the wireless receiver, Bluetooth or with the usb cable. However, to truly enjoy this headset you must download the iCUE software through the corsair website to explore the full potential such as firmware updates, sound and microphone settings and other customizations. The iCUE interface is easy to use and makes updates a breeze. Being the owner of a PS4 and a PS5, I’ve used this headset to play a few games on both consoles. The connection for both systems can only be made via the usb cable. The sound is crisp and loud especially with the FPS and action games. But those headsets truly shine with the wireless receiver dongle connected to a PC. I have a decent gaming desktop and tried a few 5.1 action games and the sound blew me away. The surrounding sensation is on par with the best headset I’ve owned that cost much more. To better gauge the capabilities of this system without the distractions of playing a game, I listened to several sample 7.1 and 5.1 videos on YouTube, and I was impressed with the sound separation. To be honest, I was more impressed with the 5.1 tests. Bluetooth connection is easy to establish. I set it up with my phone and made a few calls to test the effectiveness of the microphone and the listeners had no complaints. I’m not much of a talker while playing online games but the few exchanges I had with other players were clear and problem free according to them. Music quality came out great as well with clear highs and solid lows. This headset is well designed. The oversized soft earpads make wearing those headphones comfortable for long hours. The pressure around the ears is minimal and tolerable for long periods of time. Clever use of the volume dial to change the equalizer settings by pressing it. With a short press of the power button, you can easily switch between the wireless usb receiver and Bluetooth depending on your set up. I was also impressed with the good battery performance. I used the headset for 3 days straight for at least 6 hours a day playing videogames, listening to music and podcasts and making phone calls and I still had power left. This model does not have a noise cancelling feature but the oversized earpads do a decent job at keeping the outside noise away and it’s good enough for me. To conclude, I will say that the quality build and performance of the Corsair HS55 make it a great buy for all kinds of gamers, from beginners to experts. The price is right, the options are plentiful, and it delivers where it counts.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The COSAIR HS55 Wireless Gaming headphones are superior to all other headphones I have used. They are so light and comfortable with memory foam pads that cover my ears and the inside of headband. It automatically adjusts to my head and ears. It doesn’t move when turning my head suddenly or bending downward. These headphones are wireless and so easy to charge. They need charged before you can use them. They come with cord that must be put in charging block to charge. I just used my iPhone block. Once charged you good to go. I have used these headphones with my laptop using the included USB wireless receiver. You simply put the receiver into the USB outlet on laptop. I used the Bluetooth on my iPhone to wirelessly connect to the headphones. I loved listening to music through it while doing housework. All the controls are located on the ear pieces. It has a microphone mute button, volume control, charging port, Bluetooth multi-function, power button and pairing button. It works with iPhone, iPad, laptop and PlayStation. It works with other devices but these are the only ones I have used it on. I even use it to answer my phone while cleaning. The microphone is easily flipped down to unmute and flipped up to mute. Although I don’t use the mute button on the headset, you can use it as well. The HS55 is great for gaming, listening to movies on computer or iPad, great to listen to music. I love the comfort and stability of these headphones. I love the sound and the surround sound. I highly recommend these headphones for tons of uses not just gaming. They are great for teens as well as adults and the elderly. They are that easy and beneficial to use.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ll start with the build quality. It definitely has a premium feel for the price! I wasn\'t expecting to be impressed honestly, I mean I expected it to be good, but not feel like it was punching above its weight! The headset these are replacing cost more than double what this thing costs and it feels and looks more like it\'s more expensive... and cost way less! I\'m seriously never buying $300 gaming headsets again! It feels like it\'ll last, looks great in my opinion, and is comfortable to boot! I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare for a couple of hours before rage quitting ;-) and then finished the night with some Witcher 3! I didn\'t take it off the entire time and it felt great! The only real knock on the comfort is the heat trapped in the ears. I almost wish it didn\'t have as much noise cancelation and was open back or had cloth padding instead of leather/pleather padding. Just so some heat can escape. On the note of playing games for several hours, this thing is a battery champion! For the past couple of days, I\'ve been watching shows, testing out Dolby Atmos for Windows on it, playing games, and taking a couple Zoom calls for work with these things and it\'s still on ""High"" battery according to the iCUE software! I\'m not using Bluetooth, so perhaps that\'s helping with the battery, but I don\'t think I need to worry about it. It\'s rated at 24 hours of continuous use and at this rate I feel like it\'ll do it! But when I do need to charge it, the fact it has USB-C is so convenient! Using this for gaming is incredible! Flip up the mic to mute and it gives a little audio ""Mic Off"" in Siri like voice is a nice touch. Flip it down and it\'ll let you know the Mic is on. If you don\'t wanna flip it up to mute, you can simply press the button on the back of the left ear. The 3D preception of these headsets are pretty darn good too! In the Witcher I was really able to pin point where NPCs were talking from. Great bass for the game music, and super clear voices when I needed to listen to the plot! Music and movies in general sound incredible as well. I\'m no audiophile, but to my ears, they sound better than my AirPod Pros, and I rave about those all the time! All in all, like I said in the title, these ARE the best headsets I\'ve ever owned!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently received the Corsair HS55 Wireless Gaming Headset and I must say I am quite impressed! These are the ultimate gaming headsets that offer incredible sound quality, comfort and versatility. One of the coolest things about the HS55 is its wireless capabilities. You can switch between low latency 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, giving you the freedom to move while you play. And with a signal distance of up to 50 feet, you don't have to worry about losing your connection if you wander too far. The sound of this thing is really impressive. Custom 50mm neodymium audio drivers deliver stunning sound quality and range, and Dolby Audio 7.1 surround sound for PC and Mac adds immersion. I found myself completely lost in my games when using this headset. The HS55 is also very convenient to use. The ear cushions are made of memory foam and synthetic leather and are designed to be lightweight and durable. In addition, the earpiece has volume and mute controls that are easy to adjust. The microphone is also very good - it picks up your voice clearly and you can mute it if needed. Another thing worth mentioning is the Corsair iCUE software. This opens up a lot of sound settings so you can customize your experience to your liking. Overall, I would recommend the Corsair HS55 Wireless Gaming Headset to anyone serious about gaming. Whether you're gaming on PC, Mac or mobile, these headphones will give you an immersive gaming experience you'll never forget."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The HS55 Wireless headset is a great entry level gaming headset. It won't blow you away, but it's solid, light, comfortable and does its job well. Let’s dive in! The HS55 are very lightweight, but the plastic build doesn’t necessarily make it feel cheap either. These do feel like solid headphones. A faux leatherette covers the ear caps and provides cushioning on the headband, which adjusts to different lengths. I found them very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. As a glasses wearer, this was a big deal – the ear cups were held solidly, but not with enough force to feel like my glasses were being jammed into my head. Design wise, these look nice. The built in microphone arm definitely make them gamer-y, but I don’t find them ostentatious. There are no flashy lights here - just headphones. The ear cups rotate to lay flat, so they sit well on your desk, but unfortunately do not come with any case for travelling. The right earpiece contains the power button and Bluetooth button, while the left hand side has a mute button (although raising the microphone arm mutes, as well), a volume slide wheel, and the USB-C charging port. The volume slide wheel has a nice click to it, helping prevent runaway volume. Clicking the volume slider changes the equalizer presets. While the HS55 can connect with Bluetooth, it comes with a USB dongle to enable a 2.4 GHz wireless connection. This the preferred connectivity method, as it’s the one that can connect with the software. Speaking of the software, the Corsair iCue software works great. After installation, it quickly detected the headset, prompting an initialization of a firmware update. Using the software allows you to view battery level (including adding it to the windows taskbar), as well as adjust equalizer options, and microphone levels. It should be noted, however, that the software comes in at just over 3GB. If you’ve got other Corsair products, you may already have the software, but in my case, 3GB is a lot only for one device without many options. As for sound quality, I’ve no complaints. I do not think these are the greatest sounding headphones out there, but certainly not bad. The sound is 7.1 and you can set up surround audio from both the iCue software or built into windows. I listened to music, played some games, and joined a group of five others on Discord and had no problem discerning sounds and hearing others. Speaking of Discord, these are specifically Discord Certified. I’m not entirely sure what that certification process entails, but my friends had no problem hearing me. They aren’t active noise cancelling, but the ear cups do a great job of blocking a lot of environmental noise. The battery life on these is more than sufficient, as is their charge time. The range is pretty far too – I was able to walk to my next room over and still stay connected. I’ve got two main issues. Firstly is with sidetone. That’s a feature that allows you to hear your own voice in your headset when speaking. Even turned up all the way, I never felt like I actually heard it. The second issue is the Bluetooth. If you’re connecting and using it as a Bluetooth connection it works great. Where it falters is the dual connection – connected to one device with the USB dongle AND to a Bluetooth device. In this mode you cannot hear audio from both devices at once. Rather, it allows you to hear and take calls from the Bluetooth connection. It’s only one connection at a time for actual device audio. I did not hear any quality difference between the USB dongle audio and the Bluetooth audio. It should be worth noting that the above issues do not detract from my overall feelings of this headset. Those are minor issues that I think aren't to be expected at this price point. Ultimately, if you are looking for an entry level headset that’s better than average, you’ve got it right here. You could go cheaper, and I think the quality would suffer. You could go more expensive, and I think you’d get some more bells and whistles. What we have here is a good sweet spot. If you want a solid set of gaming headphones that sound good, look good, and perform well, these are what you’re looking for."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] One of the nice features of these headphones is their wireless connectivity either via USB dongle or Bluetooth. However, at least on a Mac, the headphones must be connected via the USB dongle in order for the Corsair software to recognize the headphones. I was connecting them via Bluetooth and the software would not recognize them. The sound quality is exceptional. The headphones feature custom-tuned audio drivers, which deliver clear and immersive sound, allowing one to be fully part of the gaming experience. The Corsair software is used to switch between stereo and Dolby Atmos, so if your game is in Atmos the headphones will be able to recreate an Atmos sound field. In addition to the impressive sound quality, the headphones are also very comfortable to wear. The ear cups are made from memory foam and covered in a soft, breathable fabric that feels great against the skin. They don’t heat up that much so you can wear them for a long time without being uncomfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 18 hours of use on a single charge. Overall, I highly recommend the Corsair HS55 Wireless Gaming Headphones to anyone looking for a high-quality gaming headset. The sound quality is excellent, the headphones are comfortable to wear, and the wireless connectivity is reliable and easy to use.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First impressions of the headphones are of clean well made construction, Although mostly plastic, they seem sturdy enough. The ear cups are large and fit over ears easily. The padding of ear cushions is good, and they are fairly comfortable. The headband is nicely padded and comfortable. These should be good for extended wearing. Now on to the actual use, sound, and iCUE software interface. The mic is responsive, and mutes when flipped up. Also, mic volume can be adjusted. These can operate wirelessly with the provided dongle, or Bluetooth. I found range good with either method. I found the audio delay to be none with wireless, but quite a bit of delay using Bluetooth. Watching a movie or gaming will be not acceptable using Bluetooth. Using wireless, I experienced a strange issue - streaming a movie slowed to a point where I was watching a spinning circle. Switched to Bluetooth, and all was good - other than the audio delay. I felt the iCUE software was not as intuitive or as easy to use as I would like. The EQ was not as good as the built in one in Media Player - and these headphones definitely need an EQ.... Having 50mm drivers, the bass is a bit too strong - and boomy. The highs are recessed, mids a little forward. I found with some careful EQ settings, I could get a reasonably balanced sound. I did try some Dolby settings which can some effects. Did not get into Invidia settings. Overall, I can only recommend at the price, and if you like experimenting and tweaking settings. Personally, I just want to enjoy good sound for gaming, movies and music without too much ""fiddling"".', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What’s in the Box: HS55 Wireless Headset USB Wireless Receiver (USB Type A) USB Charging Cable (Type A to USB-C) No instructions were included in the box. Not even a quick start card with a link. However, instructions can be found on the Corsair website under support. (Best Buy provided this reviewer with an emailed instruction guide.) First thing, charge the wireless headset. While the headset is charging, download and install the Corsair iCue software from the Corsair website. Once the headset is charged, plug in both the RF Receiver and headphones to your laptop/desktop’s USB ports in order to update the firmware. (Since my laptop only has one USB Type A connection, I needed to locate a USB-C to USB-C cable for the update.) Run the iCue software and follow the prompts to update the firmware. The headset will work just fine without installing iCue. But iCue is needed for firmware updates and to access some settings, like custom equalizer settings. I found the headset comfortable. It fit me well, however it does not appear to be size adjustable. There are intuitive controls on the headset. Plus, to easily mute the mic just flip it up. A brief tone lets you know you have muted and when you have unmuted by flipping the mic back into place. There is also a mute button on the headset if you prefer. The Wireless Receiver is for RF wireless connectivity to a laptop/desktop or to a PS4 or PS5 console. It works great with no pairing needed. I found no noticeable latency with the RF wireless connection. I tested the headset with some light online gaming. Transmit and receive were both very clear. I also tried it out with some voice recognition software and found that using the headset mic, I was understood much better than with my usual setup. I also noticed that I can go much farther away from my laptop using the RF wireless receiver than with Bluetooth without losing connectivity. The headset also works as a Bluetooth headset and will pair up and connect to phone, tablet, computer, etc. I used it over Bluetooth for work video conferencing as part of my testing. My colleagues noted that the mic on the headset was clear and sounded very good. The mic also provided good background noise filtering. The Corsair HS55 Headset is a solid performer, with both RF and Bluetooth connectivity. Sound is very good and the mic is crystal clear. The headset is comfortable and battery life is very good.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I thought it was better than my old void pros. Sound wise it’s pretty nice. But less comfortable than the pros from 2017. A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE HEADSET IN MY OPINION The hinges where the speakers turn from the head band are made of plastic and just snap so easily. Literally ruins the headset. And is smaller in size as well. Was hoping for a more premium feel. Save your money and go with steel series or even hyper X.']"

So far the best for the price in terms of build quality, sound quality, features and options it has. The box is included with the cable for charging. The best part is it has a JBL app supporting these headphones using which we can customize some of the settings and the setup is very easy. Coming to wearing it for a longer time is also good without any complaints with its long-lasting battery and feather kind of light weight. Coming to sound quality and bass is great for the price. It has the option of a multipoint connection, like connecting to 2 devices at a time and switching between them, but I found it a little hard to switch and there was no clear info about it. Other than that, the rest of the things are absolutely great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around experience. I enjoy using these headphones while in the office or chores around the house. They block out just enough sound without making me feel like I am missing anything going on around me. Very easy to connect to my phone and computer. The sound quality has been perfect for both music and podcasts. They are a good weight to where I do not feel bogged down while wearing. I look forward to using these when I need a little me time in the office.', ""The JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones are the best headphones I've had so far, the sound quality is sensational and they soundproof perfectly. They have a built-in microphone and volume control in the earpiece, which is very convenient to use. These are wireless earphones that connect via Bluetooth, and additionally work with the Google Assistant, so you can control them with your phone using voice commands. They last over 50 hours on a single charge and can be connected to a phone and a laptop at the same time. They are very comfortable to use - they have soft inserts and a headband with a large range of adjustment, and the headphones are foldable, thanks to which they can be easily packed into a purse or backpack. I use headphones every day to listen to music, give tutoring or talk on the phone and in each of these options they work great. Sometimes even children use them when they want to listen to their favorite children's songs and they are also delighted. I highly recommend :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tune 520 are over-ear headphones, made of plastic with faux-leather earcups. Like I said they’re very lightweight and the earcup padding is plush, but the clamping force is pretty high so those with larger heads (like me) will be uncomfortable after even a moderate listening session. Those with normal-sized heads might feel differently. Overall, the construction seems pretty good. The controls on the 520 are straightforward and similar to other JBL units. There are buttons on the right ear cup to help you turn the phones on and off, adjust volume, skip tracks forward and backwards, play/pause audio. The power button is also used for Bluetooth, and the upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 is a nice addition. The headphones support multi-point connection, which means that they can connect to two devices. Charging is handled by USB-C. You can also adjust the equalization using the JBL Headphones app. The 520s delivered very balanced sound out of the box. It was extremely flat, but connecting to the app allows you to tailor them to your liking. Stereo separation is great and the bass extension in the app provides a ton of punch. It took me a little while, but I was able to get the equalizer set to my liking. Bottom line: The JBL Tune 520 are a nice way to break into JBL headphones. They’re super lightweight, the battery life is tremendous, and if you like bass you’ll love these headphones. The ability to tailor the sound using JBL’s app (which I really like) is a big plus for headphones in this price range. You just better have a smaller head.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable, crisp, light weight and sleek. I like how they aren't bulky, I don't feel like they are wearing me..simple buttons with function. They are very comfortable on my ears for hours. They definitely have good bass sound for my daily tracks I wouldn't recommend for a bass enthusiast but they do enhance the bass in my tracks to make it sound crisp."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Starting off, the packaging is perfectly done with a good presentation. It’s strait to the point while keeping wasteful extras to a minimum. The build quality, this is something that is super important with headphones intended to be used every day. After vigorously testing and using these over a week, there is no apparent weakness and these are very well made while maintaining a super light weight. The adjustments above the ear cups are the only gripe found with these but once set in a comfortable spot they seem to stay there. Now, the most important part, the sound quality. As expected from JBL, the sound signature is near perfect strait out of the box. There is adjustable EQ capabilities on the app which brings the headphones to a new level. Punchy lows and crispy highs, these keep your tunes fresh for hours on end. The extremely respectable battery life on these outshine any others. I forgot to even charge these for the majority of the time using them so far. To finalize this, I can say without a doubt, these are a smart purchase for any average listener or school goers who need an extra upgrade in sound. I wouldn’t recommend these for any heavy movement activities but they do stay in place pretty well.']"
Logitech G935 Wireless 7.1 Surround Lightsync Gaming Headset,$223.47,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/logitech-g935-wireless-7-1-surround-lightsync-gaming-headset/13500335/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are really nice sounding headphones. However, at this point, the heat padding is beginning to peal off. I am not sure how it is possible. It was applied. Then plastic cap ends were screwed in to prevent the ends from slipping. But the came out of those ends and I have a loose top head pad that catches my hair with glue. Not a nice feeling when it get you just right. Going to look at the RMA process, but in this COVID era, I REALLY need these for work. Logitech, I own two of these, and the other is beginning to come apart as well? For reference. It is the foam padding, on top section of ring. Have every other piece of Logitech products. Keyboard, mouse, pad, speakers, etc. This is the only problem child.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Everything about this headset is great, the 50mm Pro-G audio drivers really make the sound a really great experience. I can exactly locate where the enemies are when I play games such as Apex Legends or Fortnite. They are really comfortable and the sleek design makes them a beauty. The only complaints that I have are the fact that these are massive for the average person but hey what can you ask from a headset. Also the microphone on this headset is absolutely atrocious, however if you're paying this much for a headset you might as well get an external mic as well. The headset in terms of sound is well worth the $170 price point."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, I would recommend this headset to someone who is looking for a headset. It is comfortable to wear, especially when compared to my older headset which was on-ear. The sound was great and I noticed a great improvement in comparison to my older headset. In addition, because it was wireless I did not have to worry about the cord getting caught anywhere. When I was initially looking for a headset, I gravitated toward the Logitech line because I like their product. This one caught my eye between the prices and reviews. While there were negative reviews on this product, I decided that I would not fully know until I saw it for myself. But I did make a note of these reviews when I bought them addressed some of those reviews and compared them to my opinion below. Please note that I use this headset for PC Gaming only. For specifics: The cushions used are comfortable, though they can get warm after wearing them for a long time. There was a review saying the padding used was poor quality but after wearing mine for a year and a half, the padding is still in good condition. I have not removed mine to clean (and I probably should) but when looking at the headset while writing this review, it does not look like it needs to be cleaned. The battery life is good for what I use. I Played for 8 hours one time nonstop and it was only nearing the end that I had to plug the headset in. But those days are very rare and most of the time when I finish playing I plug my headset back in to be fully charged for the next time. So if someone is planning a 24-hour gaming session, they might have to plug in the headset to keep using it for that time. But for how I use the headset, the battery life is perfect The sound is great, it was a lot better than my old headset. I would like for there to be an option to balance the L and R sounds in the G-Hub because my right ear hears a bit better than my left ear so it is quiet in my left ear (unless I am missing that setting in G-Hub). But I can hear clearly. I also like the design of the microphone. When looking at headsets, a lot either had the microphone plugged in or was fixed to be sticking out, and I felt like I could have broken it. I Like how in this design the microphone can fold away into a ""pocket"" on the headset. This makes me feel better in being less likely to break off the microphone. While the microphone can extend out to better align with my mouth, I barely do that and my friends have yet to say they were unable to hear me. So the microphone is good quality. I have only had two issues with this headphone, one is frequent and one is recent. The frequent issue is that when I fold away the microphone and then pull it back, it acts like it is still folded away. After a minute of going through settings, I can correct it but I still do not know why this is happening. It would be a software issue or user error, I do not know. The other issue I have had is after a year and a half the left side stopped working. After some digging around online, a recommendation was to unplug the battery for five minutes and then plug it in. I tried that and it worked. I was surprised at how simple that was. I wish there were better troubleshooting guides/tools on what to do in case that happens. I see other reviews saying the same issues, including being on the same left side. While I do not know the specifics of the design, I would like to recommend that Logitech look into this issue a bit and see why the left side keeps having issues. So to summarize, overall the headset is comfortable, it has good sound quality, and I like the microphone. The only two issues were acting like the microphone was still folded away and the left side stopped working for a bit.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first got the headphones the first thing I noticed was that the padding at the top of the headset was not fully secured, I decided that it wasn't a big deal and that I could just tuck it back up under the place it was supposed to be mounted. Every now and then it would come back out but I thought the headset sounded good and felt comfortable. About a 8-9 months after I purchased the headphones the pleather on both the ear cups started flaking off just a little at a time - but every time I wore them more would come off. The final straw was after about a 14 months of owning the headset the sound in the left ear would fade in and out. Would be working fine then start fading in and out - toggling the on off button a few times - or partially turning the headset to the off position would fix the sound. I have spent well over $1000 at best buy on LOGITECH gaming peripherals alone and have owned 5 different Logitech headsets over the years. The quality control is not very good any more - and such a bad system for the RMA process - switched to a different brand headphone and will never buy Logitech anything again."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I started out loving the Headset. It was as simple as plugging in the USB dongle and My gaming PC loaded the drivers without any issues, they sounded great. The FM connection gave me better range than the Bluetooth headset I had before. I also liked it did not have the same delay that drove me crazy when trying to watch movies with my Bluetooth set before and the audio not matching the lips. After installing G Hub, I activated the 7.1surround sound, giving great immersion into streaming movies and games, especially situational awareness in FPS. Although it allows for great customization of audio and RGB of the unit, I primarily kept it to the presets with great success. After going over the great parts of the headset, here comes the issues. After less than a year of use, though maybe more that average given Covid, the unit started having issues. At first, after about 10 months, the microphone would stop unmuting in discord. Lifting the Microphone up mutes the mic just fine but when putting it down unmuted it fine in the past, discord did not detect an input. Disabling the mic driver in sound setting was the only thing that would bring it back. Of course, being a good Geek; I restored Windows audio services, reset/reinstalled Discord, wiped/reinstalled drivers, clean reinstalled G Hub, and verified it was not just discord having the issue. Near the end, I just had the sound menu up to disable/reenable the Logitech mic driver whenever I was on discord and thought I might have to mute myself. My friends could easily tell the difference when I was using my Samsung Bud pros to test my system audio vs the G935s and did not have any issues. The straw that broke the camels back was this week when both the game and discord audio started fading in and out on the headphones mid mission. Even hard wired in, the game audio became distorted and volume faded out. Tapping the side of the headphones would snap it back up usually, confirming hardware issue. As they are just under a year old and have no physical damage, I could get them replaced by Logitech under Manufactures warranty . Full disclosure though, I work for Best Buy and know the value of a replacement plan on something like headphones. Especially when I got the G935 partly with store credit from the Logitech - G633 I had before (liked but left earpiece died mid session in the second year). Given this is the second Logitech Gaming headset in 3 year to fail, I think I will see if another brand can get over the 2 year mark with as good sound. I have to say they sounded great, when they worked.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this on FEB 8, 2023. Up until now MAY 22, 2024. With constant care and use the entire time. This headset has two massive flaws with its build quality. Faulty power switch coming loose over time causing static and popping noises to the point where power no long reaches the speakers and no audio to be heard in one or both speakers! The Second Flaw is the Microphone. Over time from constantly raising and lowering it. The auto mute breaks to the point to where it wont unmute on the downward position unless you wiggle it up and down until it beeps the microphone live again. You better get the 2 year replacement plan for this. If you are a little harsher with headsets. Another annoyance is the fake leather headphone earpads the crack and flake off stick your skin even if you clean them every day after taking the headset off. Plus there are no cheap replacement pads.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As my title says, I can not in good faith, recommend this headset. This is the second one I have had over the years, and it developed the same problem as the first. The power on/off switch is somehow defective. Sure it works for awhile, but after 10 months or so (with both), it started acting strange. By strange I mean it powers on, but no sound. I had to wiggle the power switch and find the right spot to get it to work and even then, the sound was muffled. Maybe there is a short in the switch somewhere or maybe Logitech uses cheap parts, but to have 2 identical headsets develop the same problem after around 10 months of use, is very sketchy.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Logitech G935 is close enough to perfect that I am giving it 5 stars. The headphones cups enclose my ears so well that the noise isolation works almost like noise canceling. The Logitech G935s are not bluetooth. They connect via wireless using a USB dongle which is discretely tucked behind a headphone (see picture). The G935s pair instantly and on a PC, PS4, or Switch (docked) you have an instant wireless connection with no need for drivers. Xbox doesn't support wireless in my tests but it works well via the included audio cable plugged into the Xbox controller. Sound is great. Deep rich base and good mid to highs. The Dolby sound is impressive and really improves games. On a PC the Logitech G Hub software lets you customize the colors and G keys - although I didn't really need to customize the buttons. SUMMARY OF WHAT THE G935 WORKS WITH PC - Wireless via USB Dongle PS4 - Wireless via USB Dongle PS4 - Corded via Headphone Port on Controller Switch - Wireless via USB Dongle in Switch Dock Switch - Corded when Portable out of Dock Xbox - Corded ONLY via Headphone Port on Controller The Logitech G935 is a great headset."", ""As a lot of other reviews have pointed out, this headset suffers from a major design problem in the switch. Essentially the power switch not only controls power to the headset, but also controls all(or most) of the data pins. Because of this, any tiny pieces of debris that find their way into the switch cause the headset to behave erratically. This causes you to have to fiddle with the switch to get it into the perfect position to get audio. There are fixes for this that involve taking the headset apart and cleaning the switch, but these are temporary solutions at best, as a couple months down the line you'll be experiencing the issue again."", ""I've had this headset for a tad over a year and a half and I've loved this headset. Sound quality, mic quality, connectivity quality all great! However, the left ear cup audio began to cut out a couple months back and you have to find the sweet spot to touch near the buttons to get audio back. The right side ear cup will also intermittently act up and you have to tap on the outside of it to regain it. I have absolutely loved this headset but, this has me looking at a new headset and potentially another brand. As a streamer, the quality of the headset is a crucial part of my set up and being able to rely on audio feedback is a necessity.""]"
JLab Epic Air Sport In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Black,$79.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jlab-epic-air-sport-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-black/16006936/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First time trying wireless ear buds. Never had much luck with any in-ear headphones, they always fall out. And so the appeal with these was the over the ear loop. I have a wired pair with them and they stay in pretty good but I rarely use them. The second appeal with these is being able to use them as a blue tooth to answer calls. They were kind of heave in my ears and the noise cancelling function was a bit strange sounding. I never got use to the various touch or hand motion commands where you can touch or tap these ear buds to skip ahead a track or change the noise cancelling function or change the volume. The main problem I have with these, beside the weight of them, is the over the ear loop is not adjustable and the angle of the in ear speaker is strange. There was a gap in the ear loop to my ear that was not rectifiable. No adjusting it. No way to make them hug my ear any better. I am including as many photos to show these angles as I can. The other draw back was the USB cable on the case is very short and was problematic when plugging it in to charge. I found it easier to just plug it straight into a battery pack rather than my laptop or an outlet adapter. Other features were nice, the various functions, being somewhat heavy duty, water resistant, etc. While they do feel heavy duty though, the weight in my ear was not pleasant. Even if the ear loops were adjustable, I probably would not have kept them.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I remember trying out the first iteration of the Epic Air True wireless earbuds and not being very impressed at all. But after going back to the drawing board and making two more updated versions, I think we are at a very happy place in our lives as true wireless users. JLab has put together a set of earbuds that not only are comfortable to wear and sound great, but they also last forever. I can't get over how they've managed to pack so much power into something so compact. 70 hours of total playtime on a single full charge. 15 hours per use and 55 more hours waiting in the charging case. It also comes with enough ear gummies to fit any ear lobe. Plus the case has wireless charging to eliminate the need for a charging brick. However, if you need to hook it up to your laptop, there's a connected USB attached to the charging case that folds away neatly( 70 flippin' hours people!!). It's water and dirt resistant and there's also active noise cancellation built in. There are 3 different listening modes that allow for Bass boost, Movie Mode and a mode that allows you be more aware when you're out on a street jog. Appropriately called Be Aware Mode. The Wear Detect sensor stops playback on your tunes when you take your earbuds out of your ear. There's much done right here. A major improvement over previous iterations, and even surpassing other big named earbuds on the market. The JLab Air ANC app allows you to customize your listening experience on the fly, while keeping on the go, but the touch controls are easy and responsive if you just need a quick change up. The only qualm I have, is the charging case is a little too big for my liking. But I understand, considering the size of the earbuds and attached hooks. Way to go JLab! Keep bringing the noise. I definitely recommend these at the price of $149.99"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you are looking for amazing earbuds that stay put, noise canceling, active noise control, wireless charging and sweatproof just to mention a few, but are not looking to spend a lot of money then look no further. JLAB EPIC AIR SPORT ANC are great earbuds that sound good, are packed with tons of features and actually give you active noise control for a very reasonable price. These have become my new favorite earbuds. So let’s go over some of the features, sounds quality and things that need some improvement. So as I write this review I currently have my earbuds in and listening to some music and I cant hear a thing around me which is awesome, but what I did notice was that the noise canceling works best with the provided “Cloud Foam” ear tips they also make wearing the ear buds more comfortable, almost as if you don’t have them in and finally they keep them in place. So, thumbs up for the ear tips and the active noise control. The Epic Air Sport ANC are packed with features such as touch controls, Active noise control, Wireless + Usb charging case, IR wear detect senor, dual connect, calling, movie mode, AIR ANC APP and finally IP66 sweatproof. Touch Control- The touch controls on the earbuds work great for volume control, answering phone calls, and even brining up your virtual assistant on your phone. You are also able customize the touch controls to fit your needs. Active Nose Control- The active noise control on these earbuds work great along with the “Be Aware” option which lets you hear ambient sound around you so that you’re not completely absent but these options worked the best with the cloud foam ear tips. Wireless and USB Charging- When I first opened the packaging, I thought I was missing a charging cable until I started to look for the charging port and found built in charging cable under the case, with a perfect fit, along with the wireless charging symbol. Although the charging cable is a bit short, but it alleviates you from carrying around a charging cable with you and with the wireless charging you don’t even need to worry the length of the cable. IR Wear Detect Sensor- There are tiny infrared sensors built into each bud which allows you to automatically pause and play your music when you take them out and put them back in. Dual Connect- The dual connect option allows you to connect either one for both of the earbuds. Both earbuds have microphones built in so each one can be used independently. So, in case you lose one, you can still use the other one. FIT and Sweatproof- These earbuds stay put while working out and are so easy on the ears. I have owned other pairs of earbuds where they start hurting after a while but honestly I had no issues with these. The cloud foam tip made the experience even better. The ANC APP Now this is where I had some issues. The App is nice and it’s a great way to customize the touch controls, control the levels of Active Noise control and ambient noise, control the equalizer. Where I had my issues was with the update. Even though the app was showing me that I had an update and every time I tried to perform the update nothing happened or I got an error, but no big deal, the ear buds still fit great and performed well. All in all, solid earbuds for the price. I would highly recommended anyone looking for earbuds to check these out. You will not be disappointed.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds look good, have a great design, are loaded with convenient features, and perform well...all for an affordable price. They sound good, have great battery life (with an impressive charging case), and come with in-ear detection and the ability to use both or just one earbud (which I love for around the house stuff). Further, they have Active Noise Control, which, while not perfect, worked well for me. Lastly, and extremely important to me, they fit me well and are very comfortable. They come with plenty of tips, so you “should” also be able to find a good fit. All in all, I like these buds, what they do, how they do it, and I think they are a great value.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JLab Epic Sport has a really good fit with a variety of ear tips makes these fit just right for about anyone. The charging case is smaller than others. The noise canceling and audio quality is one of the best for a true wireless sport device. The battery life is adequate with the noise canceling running all day, with this setting you get about 7-8 hours. The pairing between various devices is a bit cumbersome but you get used to it, it’s just not the best. Overall I recommend this product if you need good fitting truly wireless headphones. They’re affordable and do a great job at delivering audio on the go.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JLab has done it again by delivering a good amount of features, good sound quality as well as noise cancelling in their latest earbuds the Epic Air Sport ANC's. The included charging case supports both usb and wireless charging and in the packaging they also include a plethora of earbud tips that should cover the majority of ear canal shapes. For this model they've made a smartphone app available that lets you customize the touch press actions and the strength of the Be Aware Audio and Active Noise Cancelling features as well as allowing you to upgrade your earbuds firmware. The sound quality of the earbuds is great and the ANC complements the sound nicely be drowning out some of the outside noise. The Epic Air Sport ANC's are a great buy and they come with a worry free 2 year warranty as well as IP66 water resistance so it makes it very easy for me to recommend them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Lots of features and superior sound for not a lot of money. These are my new favorites that I go to nearly every time. The active noise cancellation is awesome but so is the Be Aware feature that allows you to select the option of letting in surrounding noises to keep you aware of what's going on around you such as car noise while on a walk, etc. They are very sleek and compact as comfortable as well. Sound quality is awesome as well as the battery life. Multiple ear bud tip covers are included so Im sure a comfortable option exists for you,"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are of good value, I like running and these headphones will stay put, I like how they feel and look. I like how the case does have the USB charger cable. I do like how long the battery lasts, I also like how it comes with different sizes to accommodate different people. The sound is good and the noise cancelling is ok. I think they are of good value.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Worth it!! Price is very reasonable for a true wireless earphone. Quality so far is great, no regrets so far. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family to buy.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my second pair of JLab earbuds, and at least my 6th pair overall. It’s been difficult to find a single pair that could do everything I desire- sound great, wear comfortably, endure workouts (perspiration and stay in place), control easily, hold a decent charge and look good. This pair does it all. They come up short on one category - controls and added a component that will only get better - customization via an app. The build quality is nice, the Epic Air Sport ANC True Wireless Earbuds (Quite a name) feel durable and of high quality, yet are light and comfortable on and in my ears. They are packaged with several cushions of varying materials and sizes so you can find the right fit. The charging case is a bit large, but also durable, and is no doubt the secret to the battery life. A nice touch- it features a permanently connected standard USB “cable”. No searching for another cable (nor having ANOTHER cable!). It has 4 LEDs on the exterior that tell you it’s charging and how much battery is remaining. They pair easily, but you can only have them paired to play to a single device at a time. Not a huge deal to me. The app was a great surprise. Customizations include: +Noice Canceling level +Be Aware sensitivity (passes through ambient sounds. Important for when you’re out and about) +Pre-set and Adjustable Equlization +Left and Right Earbud button control settings Most important, they sound really good. I listen to a lot of podcasts and there’s nothing more frustrating than poorly reproduced voices when listening to someone talk for 2 hours. I also enjoy a wide range of music genres: everything from instrumental Jazz to Alt to Hard Rock. Nice bass range, Treble that handled most of what I could through and of course, good mid-range. Finally, the over-the-ear loops performed well. COVID makes them frustrating if you have to wear a mask, but it’s not a design flaw at all. Super pleased with the product, and the price is really, really good.']"

Sony WF-C700N In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Black,$119.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/sony-wf-c700n-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-black/17042261/review,"['After using these for a few days now l can say the following they are ver comfortable in the ear even after a few hours and great sound from a small pair of earbuds also the bass is punchy and the high ends are very clear to very easy to set up via the app and is compatible with both android and iOS devices', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WF-C700N earbuds with noise canceling deliver good performance for the price. I have them in sage color that is soft on the eyes and gives them a more modern look. Setup requires downloading the Sony earphones app. Instructions are easy to follow and Bluetooth connection was problem free. The app is easy to navigate. Lots of options to configure the sound with an equalizer and other digital sound processes, and to customize the buttons. I quickly felt comfortable navigating the app and customizing the earbuds to my liking. The case is rechargeable through a usb-c connection; no wireless charging is offered. You can monitor the charge on the app. It charges the earbuds quickly. From my experience, I was able to do about five full charges of the earbuds when they were running very low. The earbuds sound really good for the price. I own some high-end earphones and they come close; the highs are clear and not too straining, the mids are not too present and the bass is solid. I also listen to podcasts and they reproduce the vocals quite well. The noise canceling feature works great and mutes the outside distraction effectively. I use them more at work and wear them most of my workdays. I play different kinds of music and podcasts at 60% volume between 5 to 6 hours at a time. The batteries handle that easily; I usually have about 25-30% of charge left after those marathon sessions. They’re light and sit well outside the ear canal and are comfortable to wear for long hours. Those are regular earbuds and not made for exercise. They sit tight in your ear but they will fall off if you keep moving your head abruptly. Overall, the sound performance is solid. The only gripe I have is that they require registration and music streaming subscription to take advantage of the Sony 360 Reality Audio. Music streaming such as Amazon Music and Tidal are compatible with the 360 Reality Audio. My subscribed music streamer does not support it unfortunately and I’m not able to experience it for now. To conclude, I will say that besides not being able to exploit the full capabilities of those earbuds, I’m impressed with their sound quality, battery and noise canceling performances. I would describe the Sony WF-C700N earbuds as mid level earphones at an accessible price that deliver close to high end performance.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WF-C700N Truly Noise Canceling Wireless In-Ear Headphones are well made and comfortable due to their ergonomic design. They’re very compact, easy to use, and easy to travel with. I use these Sony earbuds with my Google phone for listening to YouTube videos, Spotify music, audio messages, and wireless calling. I love how small the case is and the sage color is very nice. These are easily becoming a new favorite among my wireless earbuds. The Noise Canceling and Ambient Noise features work very well! I tested these earbuds in a noisier space in my home and I could really tell how much noise was actually blocked out. I was surprised at how much noise was being piped into the earbuds with the Ambient Sound feature turned on. I could hear my fan and AC running very loudly. I was glad to be able to adjust the ambient sound level because the default was too loud for my liking. My TV was on while I used Ambient Sound and it felt like I was plugged into the TV - that’s how powerful this feature is. I used the mobile app to adjust the ambient sound level as well as the earbud button commands. I liked being able to switch between Noise Canceling and Ambient Sound with the click of a button so I made sure that command was accessible on both earbuds. Sometimes I’ll wear just one earbud, and these Sony headphones allow you to use either earbud by itself. As far as Bluetooth goes, the earbuds remember the last device paired via Bluetooth, and it’s easy to pair to new devices as well. The 15-hour battery is great for me because I’ve used the earbuds for about 4 hours over the course of 5 days and don’t anticipate needing to recharge until next week. This package comes with a short charging cable as well as extra earbud sizes for a more personal touch. I’ve been a fan of Sony’s Ambient Sound feature since my first pair of over-the-ear headphones so I was excited to try it out with these wireless in-ear headphones. Overall, I am really happy with these Sony headphones and can recommend them as a great, high-quality product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have rotten luck with earbuds. Wired, wireless…doesn’t matter. My ear canals must be smaller than the average person’s because earbuds don’t stay in my ears. The last pair that I purchased, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, are by far my favorite pair up to this point. The gorgeous violet color is what attracted me to them, and they perform well. However, they constantly fall out of my ears. If any earbud falls out of your ears, they are useless, no matter how pretty they are. The Sony WF-C700N are more utilitarian in looks, however these earbuds have so many features that I don’t know where to begin. The first thing for me was…they STAY IN MY EARS! I was shocked. I tested them while walking in a mass merchandise store, listening to my phone. I had no issues with the bud(s) slipping out of my ears while moving (not only walking, but reaching for items on shelves, reaching down into the cart, etc.). That’s only scratching the surface on these earbuds. They are compact, so they fit easily in my purse. Because the case is oblong vs. square like my Samsung buds’ case is, it fits better in small purses. I had issues with the initial setup, though. I followed the instructions, but the Headphones app was not sensing the buds for some reason. I tried to connect via Bluetooth and the phone didn’t read the buds that way, either. There wasn’t really anything for me to do differently, as they go into pairing mode when the buds were removed from the case. I ended up having to restart my phone for it to finally sync. Once I had the app working, I found that it was full of features. The app will sense what environment you are in and adjust the sound quality accordingly. My environment seemed to always default to Ambient Sound. You can also have the app analyze your ear shape to have the earbuds perform customized to your ear. However, you can only use this feature with certain pre-approved apps. The only app I had heard of was Tidal, and I’m not a subscriber to that service. I tried using the 360 Reality Audio app to analyze my ears. The analysis was completed; the 360 app, though, is for live audio. It asks you to put in ticket codes, which I didn’t have. I was able to try listening to a free music video on the 360 app for testing. The sound was good, but I didn’t notice anything that would lead me to believe that the sound was “tailored” to my specific ear type. I could go on, but this would be less of a review and more of an essay. If you are a basic user, these are a great pair of earbuds. If you are more of an audiophile, then you will have many features to tweak your experience.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The feature rich Sony WF-C700N Wireless Earbuds (truly wireless, noise canceling, Bluetooth) are a great companion for the active lifestyle. Whether it’s outside, inside the gym or mowing the lawn, I enjoy workouts in several places throughout the week. I always use earbuds for music to make the time go by faster while exercising (and protection from the lawn mower noise). This time, I was fortunate enough to use Sony’s new WF-C700N wireless earbuds. With just a Bluetooth connection and music streaming service on my smart phone to the Sony WF-C700N wireless ear buds, I am ready to go! The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come in a very small plastic case that will easily fit in your front pocket. It is a bit slippery trying to hold on to it while opening it. Once the case is opened you can easily remove the earbuds which are magnetically held in place. When it is time to put the earbuds back in the case the same magnets snap them correctly into place. A few other positives things about the case is the IPX4 rating, meaning it is splash/sweat proof (not waterproof). In total you get around 15 hours of playtime when using the case (7.5 hours) to recharge the earbuds within the case (7.5 hours). It takes about 1.5 hours to completely charge. Each earbud separately has its own charge that is used while listening (it is displayed in the Sony App). An USB Type A to a USB Type C connection, charges up the case. The cord is really short so charging has to be done close to the source of power. If the shortness of the cord is a negative, the charging of the case for 10 mins is a positive, which will give you 1 hour of playtime. The earbuds are comfortably ergonomically made with three sizes of removable buds to allow for your best fit (small, medium, large). The buttons on the earbuds are big and easy to press for all the different modes making a slight digital beep when turn on/off. This was a nice convenient surprise which made navigating the track, phone calls, noise canceling and pausing really pleasant. The WF-C700N wireless earbuds come equipped with Sony’s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine). This process upgrades the music from any source from good to better and replicates the music the way the artist intends. You can actually get CD quality sound or really close to it. The WF-C700N wireless earbuds can connect to the Sony App for a major experience of informative fun. Use your smart phone’s camera on the QR Code after opening the box. The link will appear for you go to download Sony’s App in which you select the correct product you are intending to use. The App will help take pictures of your left ear then the right ear. Analysis of these pictures will help you get the best sound possible out of your earbuds according to your ears. The Sony App has an activity log/merit badge, time used with earbuds, an EQ, Ambient Noise Control, Adaptive Sound Control (actually saves and remembers your settings while automatically applying them to where you are!), any firmware updates and access to 360 Reality Audio Setup! The best feature, in my opinion is the 360-degree reality audio experience. The music sweeps around your head space with “24 adaptive object-based points in a soundstage” like an atmosphere. This creates an amazing experience when hooked up to a streaming music service that supports 360 Reality Audio: Tidal, Amazon Music Unlimited, Artist Connection, Nugs.net, PeerTracks. Now at the moment Spotify doesn’t have premium above 320kbps, but it still is enhanced with these WF-700N wireless earbuds (not using the 360 Reality Audio). While Stereo sound is great, eventually in my opinion, it will be replaced by 360 Reality Audio with more companies in the not-so-distant future. The sound, like a “live concert,” or just listening to the different points all around you is simply amazing! It is the best way to enjoy music. The highs are clear and precise while the mids are solid and strong. The bass is thumping but very accurate (20Hz-20kHz frequency range for earbuds). The Sony App will guide you through the steps to take for the streaming service and 360 Reality Audio Setup. (You will have to create at one account in the process.) Last but not least, the large mics are in the front of the earbuds that give you better clarity and realism with the Ambient Noise Control off even with the music on (also aids better hearing/speaking in phone calls!). You can also have two paired devices, like a smart phone or laptop that you can switch between without having to reset the Bluetooth every time. I really thoroughly enjoyed the Sony WF-C700N truly wireless noise canceling in-ear Bluetooth earbuds. The Active Noise Canceling worked really well as did the comfortable fit, Sony App and 360 Reality Audio.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are really good for just about $100, punchy and deep bass is really good and aound quality is very rich. Some fine tuning in the app definitely can make a difference. Call quality is also excellent and people can hear me clearly. The easy switching between noise canceling and pass through is a breeze and can make hearing others while listening to music a simple push of a button.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony buds are fantastic and offer a lot of bang for the buck. I replaced my daily drivers of 2 years with these and can tell you they don't feel budget to me at all. Box contains the pillbox looking charging case, buds and a USB C cable. As I already have the Sony music app, pairing was a breeze. I do recommend downloading the app so you can take full advantage of what the buds can offer. I absolutely love Equalizer and not only can use the presets it comes with, but also my own preference but adjusting lows, mids and highs manually. Sound quality is excellent. I have no complaints while watching movies, playing mobile games or listening to my library from metal to classical. Comfort is surprisingly great as well. I am using the medium tips that were preinstalled and they fit nice and snug. No discomfort from a 8 hour desk job and also at the gym while running on the treadmill. With that being said, battery life just keeps going. 1 gripe is that when you charge the case, it'll turn from red to green in real time, but the app won't update the % until you replace the buds and take them out again. I used them in a 9 hour shift and they lasted all day, only having to charge it during my 1 hour lunch break. Noise cancellation works well and so does the pass through. Quite shocked for a pair of buds that are considered budget. While on, I would clap or snap my fingers close to my ears and would barely hear it at all. If you are looking at ear buds in the $100 price range and want the best, here they are. Sony did an absolute rock solid job on these and I would definitely recommend them in a heartbeat."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used earbuds from many brands and Sony always remains among my favorites. These have noise canceling features so I was looking forward to that as I have a pair of Sony C500’s without noise canceling. I was not disappointed with the C700N’s. Pros: - First, the price point for these is fantastic. It’s not easy to get high quality, AND noise canceling, AND a good price. Sony is providing all of that here. - They have a comfortable and stable in-ear fit. I can wear these on the move without issue. The default medium silicone tips were the best fit for me, but they also include small and large sizes. - Set-up was easy. I was prompted to install the “Headphones” app on my phone right after connecting to bluetooth and then got notified of a firmware update right away which was easy to do. I loved the customization options in the app as you can adjust the controls to your liking. Do you want the left or right earbud to turn noise canceling on/off? You can change this and other regular functions. I also liked being able to see the remaining power level in the case to help decide if I should charge it. - Sound quality, as usual with Sony products, was excellent for both music and podcasts. I’ve heard better, but only with much more expensive products. - The noise-canceling feature worked well and drowns out regular background noise. It’s perfect for when you are in a noisy place like a mall or an airplane. I like to use it when I mow the lawn. A quick tap can turn it off so that you can engage people around you as needed. Cons: None These earbuds are fantastic all-around and I highly recommend them for anyone in the market for a new pair.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony - WF-C700N Truly Wireless Noise Canceling In-Ear Headphones - Black Summary: High quality sound in a budget friendly, light, convenient, and comfortable package. Pros: * Price-point. The price is spot on for the features of these earbuds. I think these offer great value. * High-quality sound. Surprisingly crisp sound AND effective noise cancellation. * Form factor is thoughtfully designed. No protruding plastics. No weird imbalanced weight. * Right sized charging case. While not wirelessly charged, the case is the right size and charges the earbuds quickly. I haven't owned them long enough to see how many charging cycles it can sustain without itself being charged. * Comfortable. Due to the size, these fit perfectly in the ears and don't tire out the canals (if that makes sense). * The controls are responsive, but you cannot fall asleep with them because the buttons might be depressed (depending on how you sleep). Cons: * Can't answer calls via Siri voice commands or use Siri at all. * Need two apps to configure the earbuds. One for the earbud advanced configuration, and another for the Live 360 Audio sound configuration. Use: I've had these a few days and I can say that I love them. The sound and comfort easily beat the leading competing fruit brand. I have had a few pairs of earbuds over the years. After replacing the fruit branded ones twice due to constant malfunction, I decided it was time to replace them with another brand. Sony has been a consistent brand for audio in our home (we own some portable speakers of theirs) and thought we'd try their earbuds out. I'd recommend these headphones because of their price point. If you need more advanced features or richer bass, you might consider other units."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these Sony headphones about a week ago and have been testing them since then. I primarily got these since I had lost my previous workout headphones. I usually don’t get the earbuds since they tend to fall out when I workout, but thought I would give them a try. My previous headphones had an ear loop to ensure they stayed in place while working out. Despite these being earbuds, they stayed in place very well, though I did have to push them back in from time to time…usually after doing fast motions like jumping. The buds come with multiple silicone tip sizes so I tested out multiple sizes until I found one that was comfortable and stayed in place pretty well. What I was really impressed with for these earbuds was the noise canceling. I really wasn’t expecting them to work as well as it did. The first time I tried the earbuds was while watching tv in the background. I had forgotten about the active noise canceling (ANC) until I put them in and couldn’t hear the tv any longer. Wow! Best noise canceling headphones I’ve ever used. I usually use over the ear ANC whenever I fly (which is just about every week) and these worked better than those high dollar headphones. I tested them on my last flight and was really impressed. The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is that I could not get them to connect to the app (connected to phone without a problem). I tried multiple times, deleting then reloading the app, resetting the earbuds, restarting the phone, etc. I searched online for a solution and tried multiple ideas with nothing working. I kept getting an error that said “Cannot connect to YY2968. Check that the power of the device is on.” That was really the only downside to these headphones and they work fine without the app. These Sony earbuds exceeded my expectations for comfort, ANC, and staying in place for most workouts. I recommend these earbuds highly, especially if I can figure out how to get the app to connect to the buds.']"

Also used them to listen to YouTube video’s via a PC they performed very well. I am using them with my PC while playing video games, again the sound quality is very good. The sound cancelling works very well as I am in a room with the TV on. I find they are better than headphones as they make my ears very hot.

I haven’t used wireless earbuds in a few years as I need something with long battery life and other brands I have tried also tended to disconnect quite frequently. These earbuds have long battery life and I was able to make it through the workday without needing to recharge. The case also provides a long charge time which is great in case I forget to charge it between workdays. The earbuds are very comfortable and come with all the usual sized tips.

Coming from the older version of Sony’s great over the ear headphones, I like they also include the ambient sound feature. I use these in an office so there are times I need to allow some sound in so I know if someone is trying to get my attention. The best feature in my opinion is that they will pause the music if it detects me talking so I don’t need to take them out to have a quick conversation. Overall I think these could be the best wireless earbuds and will now replace my over the ear ones for daily use.', 'I was really excited to finally own a pair of in ear headphones as I also own over ear headphones by Sony which are my go to as I make my own music (decks drum machine etc) so I need to really listen to my track (as a beginner) for any mistakes I was worried about whether they would fall out be it walking or cycle commute but if I take a little time making sure they are in snug then I am actually blown away how good they look and how good they sound WOW really pleased the clarity through all the range of sound is exceptional and the bass is fantastic which I like bass so big thumbs up Sony. They come in a nice package which includes easy set up a usb c cable and 4 X different size (cushion) tips for ear size, the unit to store is plastic small and smart when the unit is charged and headphones returned to unit the unit will charge the headphones back up. The headphones app is a useful tool by, as the headphones can be adjusted int the way of sound preferences and will allow the user to set up the tap options. The call through the headphones was really good as I was walking with a fair bit of wind and spoke and heard very clearly All-in all these are my go to for quick listens and definitely for walking about in public they are really smart looking too so a must have', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Sony IN-Ear headphones come supplied in a very lightweight and smart looking case. They are supplied with a selection of quality earbud tips in various sizes ensuring you can obtain the best possible fit for your ear size and shape. I was impressed with the quality of the design and the finish on these in ear headphones. I found these in ear headphone to be extremely comfortable when wearing fitting snug in my ear without any pain and they really did feel secure and that it would take a lot for them to fall out (which they didn’t). These headphones connected instantly and without issue to several of my devices and I downloaded the app (link provided with the headphones) to enable me to fine tune my listening experiences through these headphones. This includes adjustments to the ambient noise levels and also the 360 Reality Auto settings. You can also get the app to survey your ears and adapt for a better individual experience. I was able to take these headphones away on holiday with me where I was able to see how good they are in a number of different situations. These included on a flight, around a busy hotel pool and walking through busy streets. I found that the noise cancelling properties were superb allowing the sound of either the music or the audiobooks to come through very clearly, without distraction. I was able to make and receive calls whilst using these headphones quickly and easily and again the quality of the call was really good. I found that functionality of these headphones was excellent and intuitive, pausing play, skipping tracks, taking calls etc. My experience is that the sounds through these headphones was clear and of really good quality, although for me personally I prefer a slightly deeper bass sound in my music that I could find / adjust to through the app. I am still looking within the app to try and make this fine tune adjustment. This would be my only negative find (but as stated this is a personal preference) on these otherwise excellent in ear headphones and I would recommend these quality headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Firstly, would like to commend Sony on the packaging, it arrived in a small cardboard box, with no plastic packaging in sight...and there were better things to come once opened. The case itself is small and light, easy to carry in the smallest of pockets. I also have the WF--SP800N buds which a few years old and that case looks huge in comparison. The case looks super stylish too and feels premium, which is what I would expect from Sony The earbuds themselves look great aesthetically, are very light to wear, even for longer periods of time. Sony included different size tips in the box, which is a great plus, so most people should be able to find the most fitting and comfortable one for them. The buds are so light however, that I found myself checking to ensure they have not fallen out. Whilst they are light and comfortable to wear, I would like for them to feel more secure. I took them out on a run and whilst they did not fall out, I felt myself adjusting them all the time. I think for running I will stick with my old WF-SP008N, as they have those little wings to keep them in place, but other than that, these WF-1000XM5 win hands down in every category. The clarity of sound is amazing. Yes, there could be a bit more bass, but the sound is bright , nuansed and balanced. The set up via the app is wuick and it's easy to adjust the sound preferrences to your liking. The touch controls on the buds themselves are very responsive, something I struggled with my older version. I can see a marked improvement on the noise cancelling, including travelling on the very noisy London Underground system. Another noticeable improvement is the wind noise reduction, which is great when taking calls. The battery last for ages, I had them for over a week and have not managed to run it down yet. Overall, I love them. They may not be the top choice if choosing them for an activity like running, but in every other category, they are a marked improvement hands down. Exceptionally light to wear, easy to set up, responsive controls and most importantly, great sound."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WF-1000xm5 series in the ear headphones comes in an exquisite tiny package that holds both ear pieces. This is probably the smallest package I've received from Sony (so be careful where you place it!) Out of the box itself has the earphones along with a small charge usb-c cable and some additional ear bud pieces. I wanted to try this device because I am familiar with the other the ear headsets and as an owner of the xm3 headset, I was excited to try out their latest cousin. Sadly for me, the earpieces are not what I expected. Firstly I have funny shaped small ears. So I immediately have problems putting the earpieces in and them staying put. They don't. They fall out instantly or with sudden movement. I tried the other 3 ear buds and through trial and error, they did stick inside my ear. They are not like the airpods which look so simple to place in and out of your ear (I am no fan of apple btw) and for me, I could've done with an earpiece that had the clip over the ear to secure it. Once I got past those 5 mins of trying to get them to stay in, I turned my attention to the connection to my phone. This was absolutely amazing. It took literal seconds to connect. It had already appeared on my phone as soon as they came on and they paired straight away. Fastest connection ever. You can instantly hear the noise cancelling feature kicking in as background sound is immediately reduced and on my phone I have a 3rd party music app that automatically kicks in so that was great too. Unfortunately with my problems with the earpieces and my ears, I'm not greeted with the bass I am familiar with on the xm3 headphones. So I have had to force them into my ears further and while doing so, I'm affecting controls like stopping music or trying to get it to hear a command. It's been a lot of fuss for me and based on my experience with them, I would rather have the xm5 over the ear headphones as I already know they sound absolutely awesome. What has let me down is the design of the earbuds that doesn't factor in ears that the buds won't settle into. When I hold the pieces close to my ears, yes absolutely I hear the bass I'm wanting to hear, but only when I hold them close. Releasing them the bass goes. I would absolutely recommend this product to those of you who are use to earbuds and earpieces, simply because I know without a shadow of doubt this version is the best of them. Sadly it's not the one that suits my ears."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has released their new WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds, and they don\'t disappoint. The box includes the earbuds, battery charging case, a short USB-to-USBC charging cable, 4 different-sized rubber ear pieces, and quick user guide/paperwork. The earbuds come with a manufacturer\'s 1-year warranty. PROS: ----------- * Easy to physically connect to a bluetooth (BT) device using the Sony Headphones app. You can also connect without the app. * The case/battery gives the user bonus listening time if on the go, if a charging port is not available. * The Noise Cancellation (NC) does work pretty well; however, they still do not compare to over-the-ear full headphones. Even with NC set to ON (default, when powered ON), I could still easily hear the surrounding audio. I did have the correct rubber ear pieces that fit my ear correctly so as to help filter the outside noise. But for earbuds, the NC worked as well or better than other high-end earbuds I have used. * The audio itself was on the ""high-end"" side. The sound was crisp and clear. With the volume up, the drivers offered good frequency response. The bass was a little lacking as with most earbuds (see cons). * The app offers a customizable 5-band EQ adjustment. This is great for those who don\'t simply want preset audio settings like ""Rock"", ""Voice"", etc. * The fitment in the ear is pretty comfy initially and look great; however, after some time, as with many earbuds, you may have to give your ear canal a small break as they can eventually be a little uncomfortable. Or maybe a repositioning also might help. Trial and error may also be needed with the rubber tips. * The ""tap options"" are adjustable in the app. You can make changes to what the taps do to an extent to better adjust to how you want the earbuds to perform when you tap them (1-4 times or long-press). * I was impressed with BATTERY LIFE of these earbuds. I used them for 7-8 hours of work (in an office setting) with a short charging time during lunch, and they went strong the entire day and still had a good bit of life left at the end of the day. Getting long life from such small batteries is key, and these earbuds didn\'t disappoint. * WIRELESS CHARGING is available with this case if placed on an induction charging pad. This is a great feature because this keeps the user from having to plug in the case every time they want to charge the case\'s battery (or the earbuds themselves if they are in the case too). There are an abundance of light options that the case provides that you can read about in the PDF. There are too many to post here. * Call quality was great during VoLTE calls on AT&T. Voices on both ends were clear and precise. I was quite impressed with the call quality. * These earbuds have a function where you can setup your head motion (nodding up/down, shaking left/right) to answer or decline a phone call. This worked well and was a pretty nice added function. CONS: ----------- * Though it was easy to connect these earbuds to my BT device, there were a ton of steps in getting these earbuds setup. If you\'re not an audiophile, these may actually be too advanced for your needs if you go through app setup. * When using the Speak-to-Chat feature (which you can turn on/off in the app), if ON and you even clear your throat, the music stops for the designated time you have set in the app. The good news is that you can adjust that time to some preset times in the app. The bad news is that if you clear your throat loud enough, your music stops, and you have to wait for it to come back after the automatic pause. I ended up turning off this feature since allergies cause me to clear my throat more than a normal person might.. and creating music pauses each time. * As with most earbuds, bass response is not going to be great unless they are literally jammed deep into your ear canal, which is not good for hearing (loss) and uncomfortable after wearing for a decent amount of time. * With most earbuds, you know how they are going to fit in your ear. With these, it takes some getting used to on what angle to insert them, and then to be careful when putting them in, not to activate the touch area due to its small size. * Perhaps maybe twice a day, for a second or two, the earbuds would go out or unsync audio (one ear would go out then the other, then recover in about a second). This wasn\'t a huge deal, but possibly a firmware update might be in order to keep them synced up a bit better. There were no other signalling devices in the immediate area that would have caused interference that caused this. This has happened before on other truly wireless earbuds I have owned; however, it does happen less frequently with this pair. * The packaging itself was rather sad-looking, uninspired, and cheap feeling. The good news is that the case/earbuds are of high quality and durability. OTHER OBSERVATIONS: ------------------------- * There was a full downloadable PDF available - 178 pages. Or you can use the web help guide which breaks down certain issues into groups. A lot of the document is dependent on what OS you\'re using to connect. * These earbuds support Alexa and Google Assistant; however, I do not use these features. I also did not use the 360 Reality Audio function since I do not subscribe to the services that use that function. It looked like something that some people would enjoy, but I was not interested in subscribing to those services. * There is a head-tracking function I tried to utilize; however, I was unable to setup due to the app and earbuds not jiving together. I followed the instructions with the tilting of the head up/down as the app suggests in real-time, but nothing every happened, and I had to simply cancel the function. So that did not work for me. * These earbuds have an instant pause/play function that only works for audio apps. For instance, I was watching DTV Stream app which also includes video, and when the earbuds are removed, the video (or live TV, really) continues to play in the background, but muted on the earbuds. * There is no wall charger included with the cable. You will have to plug into a charging port on a PC or other device OR use a standard USB wall plug. * 4 sets of rubber ear pieces come with the earbuds. Mediums are already attached. The other sizes are in the case and labeled. CONCLUSION: ===================== For earbuds, this model from Sony is definitely one of the better choices available. It\'s quite cumbersome to get these earbuds setup initially; however, the end result is quite good by earbud standards. The options available are plentiful. I haven\'t had another set of earbuds have this many options available, period. The sound is great, and they definitely stay in your ear when active. I have used when walking and riding a bike. There was some awkwardness in initially getting them in my ear the correct way, but after some time, I was able to make adjustments as needed to get the right fit and insert them correctly. They aren\'t so big that they make you look like Frankenstein either (see my ear pictures). They flow pretty well with the natural shape, and I have a small/medium ear size. For true bass sound and audio quality, I will stick with my over-the-ear headphones, but for on-the-go functionality, quality, and battery longevity, these are definitely worth purchasing. I\'d definitely recommend.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I realized today how incredibly inconvenient it is to not be able to track these earpods because, well, you just can’t! I misplaced the case with one earpod in and was just looking and looking. I wish it was register-able with Apple’s find my, or even on sony sound connect but nope. No way to locate it but to dig deep in your own memory. It’s also too big. I wear it underneath a cloth head band when I’m at work and when i take it off it hurts like heck I could cry. Not as confortable as they say. And I’m wearing the xxs and still falls off. Only things i like about it is the sound quality and the color pink.']"

I use these in an office so there are times I need to allow some sound in so I know if someone is trying to get my attention.

The case itself is small and light, easy to carry in the smallest of pockets. I also have the WF--SP800N buds which a few years old and that case looks huge in comparison. The case looks super stylish too and feels premium, which is what I would expect from Sony The earbuds themselves look great aesthetically, are very light to wear, even for longer periods of time. Sony included different size tips in the box, which is a great plus, so most people should be able to find the most fitting and comfortable one for them. The buds are so light however, that I found myself checking to ensure they have not fallen out. Whilst they are light and comfortable to wear, I would like for them to feel more secure. I took them out on a run and whilst they did not fall out, I felt myself adjusting them all the time. I think for running I will stick with my old WF-SP008N, as they have those little wings to keep them in place, but other than that, these WF-1000XM5 win hands down in every category. The clarity of sound is amazing. Yes, there could be a bit more bass, but the sound is bright , nuansed and balanced. The set up via the app is wuick and it's easy to adjust the sound preferrences to your liking. The touch controls on the buds themselves are very responsive, something I struggled with my older version. I can see a marked improvement on the noise cancelling, including travelling on the very noisy London Underground system. Another noticeable improvement is the wind noise reduction, which is great when taking calls. The battery last for ages, I had them for over a week and have not managed to run it down yet. Overall, I love them. They may not be the top choice if choosing them for an activity like running, but in every other category, they are a marked improvement hands down. Exceptionally light to wear, easy to set up, responsive controls and most importantly, great sound."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Sony WF-1000xm5 series in the ear headphones comes in an exquisite tiny package that holds both ear pieces. This is probably the smallest package I've received from Sony (so be careful where you place it!) Out of the box itself has the earphones along with a small charge usb-c cable and some additional ear bud pieces. I wanted to try this device because I am familiar with the other the ear headsets and as an owner of the xm3 headset, I was excited to try out their latest cousin. Sadly for me, the earpieces are not what I expected. Firstly I have funny shaped small ears. So I immediately have problems putting the earpieces in and them staying put. They don't. They fall out instantly or with sudden movement. I tried the other 3 ear buds and through trial and error, they did stick inside my ear. They are not like the airpods which look so simple to place in and out of your ear (I am no fan of apple btw) and for me, I could've done with an earpiece that had the clip over the ear to secure it. Once I got past those 5 mins of trying to get them to stay in, I turned my attention to the connection to my phone. This was absolutely amazing. It took literal seconds to connect. It had already appeared on my phone as soon as they came on and they paired straight away. Fastest connection ever. You can instantly hear the noise cancelling feature kicking in as background sound is immediately reduced and on my phone I have a 3rd party music app that automatically kicks in so that was great too. Unfortunately with my problems with the earpieces and my ears, I'm not greeted with the bass I am familiar with on the xm3 headphones. So I have had to force them into my ears further and while doing so, I'm affecting controls like stopping music or trying to get it to hear a command. It's been a lot of fuss for me and based on my experience with them, I would rather have the xm5 over the ear headphones as I already know they sound absolutely awesome. What has let me down is the design of the earbuds that doesn't factor in ears that the buds won't settle into. When I hold the pieces close to my ears, yes absolutely I hear the bass I'm wanting to hear, but only when I hold them close. Releasing them the bass goes. I would absolutely recommend this product to those of you who are use to earbuds and earpieces, simply because I know without a shadow of doubt this version is the best of them. Sadly it's not the one that suits my ears."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sony has released their new WF-1000XM5 Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds, and they don\'t disappoint. The box includes the earbuds, battery charging case, a short USB-to-USBC charging cable, 4 different-sized rubber ear pieces, and quick user guide/paperwork. The earbuds come with a manufacturer\'s 1-year warranty. PROS: ----------- * Easy to physically connect to a bluetooth (BT) device using the Sony Headphones app. You can also connect without the app. * The case/battery gives the user bonus listening time if on the go, if a charging port is not available. * The Noise Cancellation (NC) does work pretty well; however, they still do not compare to over-the-ear full headphones. Even with NC set to ON (default, when powered ON), I could still easily hear the surrounding audio. I did have the correct rubber ear pieces that fit my ear correctly so as to help filter the outside noise. But for earbuds, the NC worked as well or better than other high-end earbuds I have used. * The audio itself was on the ""high-end"" side. The sound was crisp and clear. With the volume up, the drivers offered good frequency response. The bass was a little lacking as with most earbuds (see cons). * The app offers a customizable 5-band EQ adjustment. This is great for those who don\'t simply want preset audio settings like ""Rock"", ""Voice"", etc. * The fitment in the ear is pretty comfy initially and look great; however, after some time, as with many earbuds, you may have to give your ear canal a small break as they can eventually be a little uncomfortable. Or maybe a repositioning also might help. Trial and error may also be needed with the rubber tips. * The ""tap options"" are adjustable in the app. You can make changes to what the taps do to an extent to better adjust to how you want the earbuds to perform when you tap them (1-4 times or long-press). * I was impressed with BATTERY LIFE of these earbuds. I used them for 7-8 hours of work (in an office setting) with a short charging time during lunch, and they went strong the entire day and still had a good bit of life left at the end of the day. Getting long life from such small batteries is key, and these earbuds didn\'t disappoint. * WIRELESS CHARGING is available with this case if placed on an induction charging pad. This is a great feature because this keeps the user from having to plug in the case every time they want to charge the case\'s battery (or the earbuds themselves if they are in the case too). There are an abundance of light options that the case provides that you can read about in the PDF. There are too many to post here. * Call quality was great during VoLTE calls on AT&T. Voices on both ends were clear and precise. I was quite impressed with the call quality. * These earbuds have a function where you can setup your head motion (nodding up/down, shaking left/right) to answer or decline a phone call. This worked well and was a pretty nice added function. CONS: ----------- * Though it was easy to connect these earbuds to my BT device, there were a ton of steps in getting these earbuds setup. If you\'re not an audiophile, these may actually be too advanced for your needs if you go through app setup. * When using the Speak-to-Chat feature (which you can turn on/off in the app), if ON and you even clear your throat, the music stops for the designated time you have set in the app. The good news is that you can adjust that time to some preset times in the app. The bad news is that if you clear your throat loud enough, your music stops, and you have to wait for it to come back after the automatic pause. I ended up turning off this feature since allergies cause me to clear my throat more than a normal person might.. and creating music pauses each time. * As with most earbuds, bass response is not going to be great unless they are literally jammed deep into your ear canal, which is not good for hearing (loss) and uncomfortable after wearing for a decent amount of time. * With most earbuds, you know how they are going to fit in your ear. With these, it takes some getting used to on what angle to insert them, and then to be careful when putting them in, not to activate the touch area due to its small size. * Perhaps maybe twice a day, for a second or two, the earbuds would go out or unsync audio (one ear would go out then the other, then recover in about a second). This wasn\'t a huge deal, but possibly a firmware update might be in order to keep them synced up a bit better. There were no other signalling devices in the immediate area that would have caused interference that caused this. This has happened before on other truly wireless earbuds I have owned; however, it does happen less frequently with this pair. * The packaging itself was rather sad-looking, uninspired, and cheap feeling. The good news is that the case/earbuds are of high quality and durability. OTHER OBSERVATIONS: ------------------------- * There was a full downloadable PDF available - 178 pages. Or you can use the web help guide which breaks down certain issues into groups. A lot of the document is dependent on what OS you\'re using to connect. * These earbuds support Alexa and Google Assistant; however, I do not use these features. I also did not use the 360 Reality Audio function since I do not subscribe to the services that use that function. It looked like something that some people would enjoy, but I was not interested in subscribing to those services. * There is a head-tracking function I tried to utilize; however, I was unable to setup due to the app and earbuds not jiving together. I followed the instructions with the tilting of the head up/down as the app suggests in real-time, but nothing every happened, and I had to simply cancel the function. So that did not work for me. * These earbuds have an instant pause/play function that only works for audio apps. For instance, I was watching DTV Stream app which also includes video, and when the earbuds are removed, the video (or live TV, really) continues to play in the background, but muted on the earbuds. * There is no wall charger included with the cable. You will have to plug into a charging port on a PC or other device OR use a standard USB wall plug. * 4 sets of rubber ear pieces come with the earbuds. Mediums are already attached. The other sizes are in the case and labeled. CONCLUSION: ===================== For earbuds, this model from Sony is definitely one of the better choices available. It\'s quite cumbersome to get these earbuds setup initially; however, the end result is quite good by earbud standards. The options available are plentiful. I haven\'t had another set of earbuds have this many options available, period. The sound is great, and they definitely stay in your ear when active. I have used when walking and riding a bike. There was some awkwardness in initially getting them in my ear the correct way, but after some time, I was able to make adjustments as needed to get the right fit and insert them correctly. They aren\'t so big that they make you look like Frankenstein either (see my ear pictures). They flow pretty well with the natural shape, and I have a small/medium ear size. For true bass sound and audio quality, I will stick with my over-the-ear headphones, but for on-the-go functionality, quality, and battery longevity, these are definitely worth purchasing. I\'d definitely recommend.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I realized today how incredibly inconvenient it is to not be able to track these earpods because, well, you just can’t!

No way to locate it but to dig deep in your own memory. It’s also too big. I wear it underneath a cloth head band when I’m at work and when i take it off it hurts like heck I could cry.

I have used these to listen to music via an ipod, easy to pair and setup. The sound quality is very good, I listen to heavy metal and like it loud, these are great for that. Also used them to listen to YouTube video’s via a PC they performed very well. I am using them with my PC while playing video games, again the sound quality is very good. The sound cancelling works very well as I am in a room with the TV on. I find they are better than headphones as they make my ears very hot. So all in all they are a great product.', ""I bought these quite recently but I can already see a massive improvement in comparison to my last wireless earphones. They are very comfortable, sometimes I forget that they're still in. Also the device shines when paired with the features on the app such as the ability to pause the music and have a conversation the moment you start speaking feels fluid. I also really like that you can run a test to ensure you have the optimal earbuds in to get the maximum effect from the noise cancellation. I ride a bicycle to and from work and the ambient sound comes in handy, allowing me to hear the noise around me whilst still being able to enjoy my music at a reasonable level. The case is a lot smaller than I had imagined it would be which is great because you can have it in your pocket without the feeling of carrying a bulky item."", 'great earphones with fantastic audio and360 surround sound and many more features.

No way to locate it but to dig deep in your own memory. It’s also too big. I wear it underneath a cloth head band when I’m at work and when i take it off it hurts like heck I could cry. Not as confortable as they say. And I’m wearing the xxs and still falls off. Only things i like about it is the sound quality and the color pink.']"
Microsoft FBAMSQXL00001 Wireless Bluetooth Active Noise Cancellation On Ear Light Gray Headphone (QXL-00001),$406.91,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/microsoft-fbamsqxl00001-wireless-bluetooth-active-noise-cancellation-on-ear-light-gray-headphone-qxl-00001/16582216/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Please don't buy Microsoft surface headphones 2. They are very cheap and less durable. The headband(which is the actual spine) got broken just after 4 months of warranty period is over(Serial No : 001649102055). I am very disappointed with the quality of hardware they are produced. I recommend don't buy Microsoft hardware products and waste your valuable money"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While they adequately perform most tasks, I've had two of them break on me. The first time one of the sides stopped playing any audio which Microsoft replaced under warranty. The second pair broke in half down the middle of the band which is an extremely common problem that you can read about online. All I was doing at the time was removing them from my head. Despite this known issue, Microsoft would not replace my headphones (the now RMAed warranty was done) and wanted $180 to repair them. While you might enjoy them while you have them, I will never be buying another pair due to clear quality and engineering problems."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love these. Finally decided to upgrade from my Sennheiser HD 558 and wanted something without a cable to get tangled. I'd say the sound quality one these is just as good, if not better. The noise cancellation is fantastic though. I can't even go back to my old headphones after using these. Even if I'm not listening to music, I keep them on when I'm at my computer just to block out background noise. The battery life is also very good, requiring charging once every 3 to 4 days even with heavy use. They also charger very quickly so I can get another hour or two of use after about 5 minutes of charging."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good sound. Good comfort Good sound isolation. Even with air conditioner blasting. I don’t hear the ac and neither does the person I am talking to. Great for remote conferencing in Microsoft Teams. Best Bluetooth headset I have used when sharing between multiple devices like laptop and phone. However, phone, computer, or headset can still get out of sync. Spin controls are super cool. Touch controls for play/pause are good but can be a little inconsistent.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones while they last. Audio is great after some EQ tweaks and the noise-cancelling is a fun feature for office work. Build quality can degrade quickly, however. After only 8 months of owning these headphones, the rubber headband has begun to separate from the plastic body, and while the problem is minimal now it will definitely worsen in the future. Microsoft’s website is confusing and finding a way to replace or repair these is frustrating.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'm still trying to decide if I like these. The noise cancelation could be better, for sure. The Bluetooth connection to my Windows PC is quirky. It keeps switching between modes and dropping the sound occasionally as I switch between apps. I haven't liked the way switching works between my PC and iPhone. But the overall performance is good for the price."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are made by Microsoft, so I expected them to work well with Microsoft Teams. I noticed the mic dropping during calls. When I got in touch with Microsoft, they agreed to send me a new one. The new one has the same issue. So they’re just bad headphones! And now I’m stuck with them cause they’re past the return policy by best buy', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The best feature of these headphones is the auto-mute in Zoom when you take these off. Also, there is a physical mute button with an LED indicator that will toggle mute on Zoom as well!! Dials are the best ways to change the volume and ANC level. Passthrough and amplification work really well! The battery lasts around 18 hours, not the best compared to Sony but the other features make it better. The comfort of the cushions is soft and cushiony but solid so it want to get mushy over time. No hot spot issues on the headband of the headphones. The EQ in the app actually does stuff!! You can really dial your preference more so than other app-based EQs. In the app is where you get the updates and can change the paired devices. It can pair with a phone and computer (mac, windows, iPad). So when you turn on headphones it will tell you what you are connected to and how much battery in hours are left. GREAT FEATURE! Sound is clear, bassy, vibrant. I am not an audiophile, and this is not a headphone for audiphiles. They perform great!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They are awesome, but ANC and sound quality are not as good as the Sony M4. I love having the controls for the levels of ANC right there. I hate having to go to the app to change that, like in the Sony’s. Overall, they are a good option for the price', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I use these with a surface laptop and also with my IPhone XR. They connect to both automatically and switching back and forth is pretty easy. I like the noise cancelling and the sound quality.']"

JBL Tune 520BT Headphones are very well designed and simple to use. Very well packaged as well as graphics on box. The moment I unboxed I realized these were solidly built and designed which I am accustomed to from JBL. Packaging was on point with a quick and easy setup manual. Headphones were charged and ready go right out of the box. Easy to setup and connect to blue tooth. The Tune 520BT sound was very good from a basic easy to use headphones. They seemed to block out surrounding noise. I would like to try on a flight and see how they perform. I definitely believe if your looking for well priced and easy to use headphones with good build and sound quality these are a no brainer. The only negative is I wish they came with a better storage bag or case for protection when not in use or putting them in a book bag. These would be great for kids and teens. I definitely will use as my go to headphones.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound on these headphones are absolutely amazing! Such great quality! The amount of time the battery last for is great too! Charging doesn't take too long and is easy to do. Connecting to Bluetooth is simple. The only thing I could see as a downfall is some people may not like the size of the ear pieces. They are on the smaller size."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great headphones for music high on bass the app is a plus you have control over your settings at any time this is a very cool tool Seems like is a noise canceling headphones because I can’t hear outside noise even on low volume', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used these headphones for a few days now and for the price, I am very impressed. Decent padding on the top and ears. I can wear them comfortably for hours. The blue tooth range is good because I move from rooms to rooms without disconnection (upstairs) If I go down stairs, I lost connection. The sound is better than I expected for the price. Lyrics are clear and base is deep. The ability to connect the JBL Tune 520 BT to multiple devices simultaneously, without needing to disconnect and reconnect, makes my lives a lot easier because I connect them with my work computer and my phone. The only complaint I have is the charging cable is a bit too short.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using this JBL Tune 520 BT headphones for about 10 days. So far the best for the price in terms of build quality, sound quality, features and options it has. The box is included with the cable for charging. The best part is it has a JBL app supporting these headphones using which we can customize some of the settings and the setup is very easy. Coming to wearing it for a longer time is also good without any complaints with its long-lasting battery and feather kind of light weight. Coming to sound quality and bass is great for the price. It has the option of a multipoint connection, like connecting to 2 devices at a time and switching between them, but I found it a little hard to switch and there was no clear info about it. Other than that, the rest of the things are absolutely great.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great all around experience. I enjoy using these headphones while in the office or chores around the house. They block out just enough sound without making me feel like I am missing anything going on around me. Very easy to connect to my phone and computer. The sound quality has been perfect for both music and podcasts. They are a good weight to where I do not feel bogged down while wearing. I look forward to using these when I need a little me time in the office.', ""The JBL Tune 520BT wireless headphones are the best headphones I've had so far, the sound quality is sensational and they soundproof perfectly. They have a built-in microphone and volume control in the earpiece, which is very convenient to use. These are wireless earphones that connect via Bluetooth, and additionally work with the Google Assistant, so you can control them with your phone using voice commands. They last over 50 hours on a single charge and can be connected to a phone and a laptop at the same time. They are very comfortable to use - they have soft inserts and a headband with a large range of adjustment, and the headphones are foldable, thanks to which they can be easily packed into a purse or backpack. I use headphones every day to listen to music, give tutoring or talk on the phone and in each of these options they work great. Sometimes even children use them when they want to listen to their favorite children's songs and they are also delighted. I highly recommend :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Tune 520 are over-ear headphones, made of plastic with faux-leather earcups. Like I said they’re very lightweight and the earcup padding is plush, but the clamping force is pretty high so those with larger heads (like me) will be uncomfortable after even a moderate listening session. Those with normal-sized heads might feel differently. Overall, the construction seems pretty good. The controls on the 520 are straightforward and similar to other JBL units. There are buttons on the right ear cup to help you turn the phones on and off, adjust volume, skip tracks forward and backwards, play/pause audio. The power button is also used for Bluetooth, and the upgrade to Bluetooth 5.3 is a nice addition. The headphones support multi-point connection, which means that they can connect to two devices. Charging is handled by USB-C. You can also adjust the equalization using the JBL Headphones app. The 520s delivered very balanced sound out of the box. It was extremely flat, but connecting to the app allows you to tailor them to your liking. Stereo separation is great and the bass extension in the app provides a ton of punch. It took me a little while, but I was able to get the equalizer set to my liking. Bottom line: The JBL Tune 520 are a nice way to break into JBL headphones. They’re super lightweight, the battery life is tremendous, and if you like bass you’ll love these headphones. The ability to tailor the sound using JBL’s app (which I really like) is a big plus for headphones in this price range. You just better have a smaller head.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Comfortable, crisp, light weight and sleek. I like how they aren't bulky, I don't feel like they are wearing me..simple buttons with function. They are very comfortable on my ears for hours. They definitely have good bass sound for my daily tracks I wouldn't recommend for a bass enthusiast but they do enhance the bass in my tracks to make it sound crisp."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Starting off, the packaging is perfectly done with a good presentation. It’s strait to the point while keeping wasteful extras to a minimum. The build quality, this is something that is super important with headphones intended to be used every day. After vigorously testing and using these over a week, there is no apparent weakness and these are very well made while maintaining a super light weight. The adjustments above the ear cups are the only gripe found with these but once set in a comfortable spot they seem to stay there. Now, the most important part, the sound quality. As expected from JBL, the sound signature is near perfect strait out of the box. There is adjustable EQ capabilities on the app which brings the headphones to a new level. Punchy lows and crispy highs, these keep your tunes fresh for hours on end. The extremely respectable battery life on these outshine any others. I forgot to even charge these for the majority of the time using them so far. To finalize this, I can say without a doubt, these are a smart purchase for any average listener or school goers who need an extra upgrade in sound. I wouldn’t recommend these for any heavy movement activities but they do stay in place pretty well.']"

Some key features that I like - wireless charging as well as rapid charging (10 min = 2 hours), noise cancellation, Spotify Tap. I’m not a fan of the design (skulls).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are my favorite headphones I've used in a long time. Previously I was using the galaxy buds pro and while gaming I use arctic wireless pros just for references. These headphones feel great when they are on, you barely notice they are around your ear. The sound is amazing, while I'm listening to music I don't have to use the highest setting (I'm roughly around 50%) the added noise cancelation helps reduce the needed volume. That being said I can't hear anything while the noise cancelation is active and while most headphones you can hear the cancelation with these you cannot. I would give these a 5 star buuuut the battery life on them isn't the greatest. I work 12 hour shifts and these don't last more than 5-6 hours while I'm using them. On the plus side a 10 min charge in the case can significantly charge them but it would be greater if it could last up to 10-12 hours."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Headphones came in a very nice but slightly large case, not something you would want to carry around in your pocket. But the headphones themselves fit very comfortably, had good sound quality and even decent noise cancelling!

I have trouble with my AirPods because they keep falling out, to the point that I don’t dare to use them when I’m outside the house in fear of losing them. These earbuds on the other hand are designed with a curve around the ears to keep them secure in place. They are great especially when you want to have earbuds while running because they do not fall out easily like others. Skullcandy was my first headphones ever, and there’s a reason. I love their design and quality. These skullcandy earbuds reflect that. The design is sleek and the sound quality is crisp. Love this product!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These just arrived from influenster and I’m in loveee. The fit is perfect and so comfortable. They don’t feel like they’re going anywhere. The noise cancelling is so good and the sound quality is comparable to my AirPods Pro. My only criticism is that the voice that says “connected” etc sounds like a demon on a 5$ mic. I haven’t really gotten to figure out the app yet, and so far I’ve been using them without it. Overall it sounds great and I can’t wait to workout with these.']"

It happened while I was reading indoors, it wasn't from mishandling or misuse. It will no longer pair, nor charge. I tried resetting the case and the earbud with no success.

I do like that they rest on the outside of the ears and not in the ear canal like most earbuds sold these days. I've only used them for a few weeks, so who knows how durable they will end up being?

The earbuds are not the most comfortable, but do remain in place securely. The length of the cables is sufficient for most uses, and the quality is durable enough to take the beating that most wired sets experience over the course of a day of regular use. And, as can sometimes be the case, when they are misplaced or lost, the replacement cost is not going to cause budgetary shockwaves. No bells or whistles on this set, but the utilitarian design and quality construction from JVC are reliable.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Needed wired earphones to use during pandemic, so that I did not have to put phone close to face, and because my wireless would run out of battery in middle of call sometimes. These were inexpensive, less than $20, and I like that the style. I cannot use the ones with gel or silicone tips because they fall out of my ear.

Certainly not the highest quality audio or comfort but perfectly serviceable, and at a low price. However, after about one month the audio volume became inconsistent, first in one earbud then both.

How many of these cheap gadgets are just going to end up in a landfill in Sri Lanka, anyway?', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These aren't bad for the price point, but spending a bit more would probably be a good idea. If I am sitting and using these they are fine, but when I'm moving around and have my phone in my pocket I have an issue with intermittent sound loss. The headphones don't fully disconnect from Bluetooth but I the audio cuts out. Makes these basically useless for taking a walk which was the main reason I purchased them."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my 3rd pair. My mom tried (and kept!) my pink pair. I purchased a white pair for my brother. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep this mint pair or give them to my sister-in-law and get the teal set for myself. (She'll probably get the teal set!) :-) I did not give it a great rating simply because it does nothing for noise-canceling on the other end of the call; for the person listening to you."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are a great, inexpensive pair of wireless headphones! They hold a charge well and last. They are comfortable and stay in your ears well and have great control finctions. I like how it is an actual button press. Compared to some that are touch; which allows for accidental command changes. Overall, great product!']"
JBL Tune Buds In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Black,$89.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-tune-buds-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-black/17039523/review,"['Overall they are good but not for the full price, sometimes the system is good but needs improvements sometimes I use the noise cancelling mode and sounds from outside still wen through, in the design and comfortability because sometimes it feels uncomfortable even changing the tips and sometimes it falls off, and the microphones sensitivity, with some improvements the next mode of it will break it. Sound system while hearing music it’s good, I like it and it’s really nice and bass is amazing.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very impressed with the sound quality of these small ear buds that fit really well. Some of the impressive features I like: 1. The size and fit without protruding outside the ear. 2. Tapping on the left ear bud turns on amient sound or noise cancellation. 3. You can pause the songs using the right ear bud. 4. Bluetooth connectivity was instantaneous....no delay whatsoever. 5. Very clear phone conversations with no noticeable background noise heard. 6. 48 hours total music time... incredible!!! Short story.... I listening to music when without noise canceling while my mother in law was visiting. A conversation insued about dinner and that when i decided to select noise canceling... haha, worked perfect. I will say, these were the only ear buds that took me a while of trying the small, medium, and large ear cups to determine the best fitment.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Tune Buds have good sound and great battery life. Pairing process was easy, open the case and search for the buds using the Bluetooth setting. Came with a USB-A to USB-C orange cable. Ear caps can be easily exchanged for smaller or larger ones, medium was the default fit and those worked for me. The JBL Tune Buds also come with the JBL Headphones app, here you have more control of the different features it comes with like noice canceling. Sound quality for both phones calls and music are good, they sound good at high volume and other caller can hear my voice loud and clear. I got about 30 hours of play time from a single charge on both headphones and case at 75% volume level so battery is good! The only weird thing about them is that even after taking them off and placing them in the case the audio will continue to play, I had to go to Bluetooth settings to manually disconnect from the Tune Buds. Overall I'm happy with this product!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Tune Buds are a pair of true wireless earbuds that are a comfortable fit, good sound quality, and effective active noise cancellation. The earbuds are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips to ensure a snug fit. They have a touch-sensitive control panel that allows you to play, pause, skip tracks, and answer calls. The earbuds also have an IPX4 rating, making them sweat and water resistant. The sound quality is good. The bass is boosted, but it doesn't overpower the mids and highs. The earbuds also have a good soundstage, which makes it feel like the music is coming from all around you. The active noise cancellation is effective at blocking out low-frequency noise, such as the sound of an airplane engine or the hum of a fan. It's not as effective at blocking out high-frequency noise, such as the sound of voices or traffic. The only thing missing from this is that it is a little loose fit in my ears, I can't use it while workout, but if you are a confortable place, it is a perfect pair."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The pros: • The sound quality for these earbuds is impressive, especially considering their form factor. The overall range is what I would expect for much larger devices (such as over the ear headphones), as well as the warmth and tone of sound. The mic is pretty good too—people I called said that the sound was clear and not an issue at all. • The app adds a lot of additional features, and my favorite is the equalizer. Once the app is installed, you can choose from among several pre-set equalizer modes (jazz, vocal, bass, club, studio, or extreme bass) or can create your own custom settings. Depending on what type of music I’m listening to (or whether it’s an audiobook, phone call, or video conference), I find myself adjusting the equalizer to enhance the sound… and love that I can clearly distinguish the differences and that the visuals help me better understand what I’m adjusting and why it’s making a difference. • I have small ears and usually struggle with earbuds like these, but this set is super lightweight and comfortable and stays in pretty well. I can leave these in for a couple of hours while walking around without having to constantly adjust them back into place, which is a huge plus, but I doubt they’d stay in if I was heading out for a run or anything that would bumps them out. • The active noise cancelling is fine, but not amazing. There’s a clear difference between ANC, ambient aware, and talk through. The ANC blocks most noise, but not everything—maybe 80% effectiveness or so. It’s better than you can generally find with this type of earbud, so I don’t think this is unreasonable at all… and I probably need to test out different eartips for a while to see if that helps. • I love that the app allows you to decide what gestures on each earbud control. I also appreciate that there’s a max volume limiter to help protect your hearing… something I’m Increasingly thinking about. The cons: • I wish the case and a little loop or something that would make it easy to use a mini carabiner to attach it to a keychain to make it easy to carry all of the time. I know I could buy a silicone cover with a carabiner, but I wish it were possible to just attach a mini carabiner to the original case since it seems plenty sturdy without additional protection. • The first time I used these for a phone call, it’s almost as if the earbuds were slightly out of sync. I could still engage in the conversation just fine, but the slight delay was a bit distracting. I’m hoping this was just a first-use fluke since it hasn’t been a problem since then (after 3 days of use with several hours each day).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are light and comfortable with excellent sound. I like the case as well. I like that the case is easy to open. That may seem something obvious, but it isn't always the case (pun intended). They aren't great for active use, but for walking or listening to music, they are excellent. They also work well for talking on the phone. I really like them for daily use. They have ANC and ambient aware features as well. They can be configured with the JBL Headphones App to apply EQ adjustments and set the controls to your liking. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. They are feature rich!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the sound quality, works amazing for music, good call quality too but I felt it lose in my ears. I tried all the buds that came with it but still they didn’t fit properly in my ears. Overall they’re a good pair of earbuds with good noise cancellation. Gonna use it during travel.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These ear buds sound great.Its bass mids and highs are perfectly tuned out the box.The noise canceling is easy to turn on and off. The controls left and right ear have different functions and that's the only thing you have to get used to.I found myself skipping a song instead of turning off noise canceling.The battery seems to last long even with noise canceling on.I don't have hour estimates since i dont use for more than a hour or two at a time.Jbl says 10 hours to 30 h depending on volume.These are light and fit snug so daily wear shouldn't be a problem."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JBL TUNE BUDS Opened the case, verified the earbud in the case and set to charging the units. On to the instructions and other contents. A type “C” charging cable under 12” Hmmmmmm! And there are simple yet somewhat effective drawing so to get started. Print is on the small side and not-so-easy to read. VIEWPOINT: Earbuds seem to come in two varieties. The first is the preferred set that if lost or damaged a replacement is very soon in hand. And the second is if lost or damaged, oh well, I will replace someday if ever. These earbud fall in the first category. They work, they function, they do what they are designed to do, and do it quite well QUALITY OF SOUND: To my ears the hardest sounds to reproduce are the human voice and the piano. Did these ear buds manage quality reproduction – Kind Of. Were the earbuds acceptable reproducing voice and piano – close but not quite there. “Pure Bass” is promoted on the box. Does not mean louder bass, My ears tell me the bass is decent, reasonably balanced, not over powering. EASE OF SETUP: Downloaded the app via the QR code included. Yet took me three tries to get left and right earbuds connected to my phone. Guessing it is operator induced error or my phone had issues with the Tone buds. May never know. MANUAL CONTROLS: To do various things, such as answer a call,factory reset noise cancelling and other functions a series of taps and long holds are required. A little practice helps. Now the noise canceling worked kind of. Some canceling out my wife’s TV shows while I listened to music. The ultimate test will be on an airplane. This will be answered in a few months. I am hopeful. HEADPHONE APP: I do like the app. As for tone controls, choices are jazz, studio and others. I preferred the studio as almost flat in the response. The app is simple to operate and use. OVERALL: The Tune Buds do produce excellent sound listening to music, watching a movie, podcasts and so on. Not as good as I had hoped via phone call. Not sure why. I am still amazed the sound of such a small package.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Tune Buds fit great. They work great for both working out and in the coffee shop. I frequently use the ambient aware, noise canceling, and standard mode depending on the context. Switching between the settings is easy. The noise canceling dampens just enough to make it nice when the coffee shop gets louder. I like the pure bass. It's overwhelming but gives good sound, not muffled. They fit in my ears well. I noticed the ear piece is more oval now than just round. I have not had any connectivity issues. It connects to both my phone and laptop with ease. The app helped me to get my Tune Buds settings the way I wanted it. I just wish there was a little bit of grip to the buds and the case. It's a little slippery. They work great for a call or video calling, but not in a noisy area.""]"

This is by far the best headset i have ever owned and i have owned a lot of them. Hands down worth every penny.Easy to set up and it checks and installs the newest firmware and software updates. So easy to set up and use and the sound quality is just mindblowing.I love the superhuman hearing and if you play FPS you will also.Enemy stps on a creaky board you will know exactly were and have a bead on them before they can even lift there weapon. I can say enough great stuff about this headset but i know if you don't have one you are missing out."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones would have earned themselves a 5 star review, had they also included bluetooth connectivity. My bad for not noticing this and it means a lot to me to use bluetooth, but that is only 1 star missing. They are comfortable, they are amazing for gaming, and the battery life is really decent on these, this is supposedly due to the dongle used for wireless. Most importantly, they are comfortable for long periods of time. And these are comfortable if you wear nerdy glasses like me (or any glasses really), because they don't make your ears sweat and my ears typically get very hot. The sound you get out of these is about as much as you could ever ask for. With gaming, you are getting sounds as though they are all around you, and it does help your game if you can hear things that are very subtle or quiet. These guys are from Germany, and are part of the Turtle Beach family of companies. The mic is detachable, and it has the flip to mute feature as well. The headband, I forgot to mention, is very comfortable as well. And the USB-C charing is fast - which helps when your battery is going low. The big dials on them helps adjust volume easily, not having to go through your computer to do. That is a huge plus. You'll enjoy these, I'm sure, as I have. Great sound, great battery life, very comfortable."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Roccat Syn pro Air is a very nicely built modern headset. Once you take it out of the box you will notice they have a little weight to it but honestly doesn’t bother once you have it over the head. The foam pads feel soft and they make a nice seal to keep outside noise to minimum. It feels like you have on noise canceling. The mic is detachable which is good if you want to use them for music listening. Setting them up was very easy, just needed to plug in the included wireless USB-A transmitter or USB-C using the included adapter. When you power the headset it will connect automatically. The sound quality was actually impressive, the game sounds were clear and immersive, and for the multiplayer people were able to hear me very clearly. The bass on these headphones were pretty deep. I liked that even when listening to music they sounded good. I like the fact that when you position the microphone to the upward position it actually turns it off, you will hear a sound when it does that. On the left earcup you’ll have a volume controller which works beautifully. On the right side there's a mic variable control but honestly I played with it and no one could tell the difference. To charge them is what I found a little weird. It seems you need to plug them to the PC to be charged. I used two different types of USC-B fast charger and it did not work. Then I connected it to a strip that has USB sockets and it worked, that was strange. Oh these headsets will work with your USB-C Android phones. I plugged in the transmitter using the adapter and it worked, so you can also game on your phone using these. You can make phone calls as well or just use them as headphones, that's awesome. The RGB lights are pretty nice. They look exactly like the mouse I have from Roccat, too bad you cannot turn them off to conserve battery or change the colors to your preference using an app like the mouse. Besides all the good there’s a few cons in my opinion. They are nicely built but they are too wide so they are big for me. People with small heads will have problems with these. Also they are kind of flimsy especially if you grab them by the side and not the center. These will not work on consoles at least not on the Xbox X I wished it did. I would have also preferred for them to use Bluetooth instead of the proprietary wireless connection. Battery life is rated for 24hrs according to the manufacturer. I have been using them for a few days but there’s no way to say how much battery is left but they are still going. Overall these headsets do the job extremely well they feel nice and have outstanding sound. In the box you get the headset, charging cable, USB-A transmitter, USB-C adapter, and manuals."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The ROCCAT Syn Pro Air wire headset performs superior above the rest. First off, this headset is by far on par in performance compared to other high end leading brand gaming headsets. Its superhuman hearing capability along with immersive 50mm 3D audio drivers undoubtably deliver performance without limits. Not to mention its rapid USB-C charging capability and ergonomic design that boasts both memory foam earpads and headband that are in line with pro gamer specifications. I’ve worn this headset for gamming sessions that last a minimum of seven hours without any issues or discomfort. The fabric is breathable and wicks moisture away. The mic is detachable with a flip-to-mute option. The added AIMO RGB lighting is a plus and adds to the esthetics of the headset. I like the fact that I can customize my in-game sound with the EQ which paired with the 3D audio, helps me determine what direction and about how far away my opponent is. In other words (above, below, left, right, or at a diagonal vantage point. 3D audio is not like traditional surround sound but rather a third dimension that helps push the boundaries of traditional surround sound giving you sound coming in at all directions. As for the superhuman hearing, I can clearly hear an opponent’s footsteps, door breaching, multiple sets of footsteps, etc. with absolute distinction of what I am up against in the game before I even see what’s coming at me. The volume rocker is ok and works as it should. Lastly, the wireless technology packed into this headset and USB dongle are second to none. After three weeks of solid everyday use, I can attest to not experiencing any connectivity or latency issues. The battery on this headset performs exactly how its described to perform. With 15 minutes of charge, I get roughly six hours of use. With a single charge I have gotten four hours a day for six and a half days or 26 hours before I got a beeping sound for charging. If you are serious about enhancing the sound quality when gamming, I recommend picking up a pair of ROCCAT Syn Pro Air, you won’t be disappointed. They have enhanced my gaming experience both on my laptop and Asus ROG Ally.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Out of the box, these Roccats sounded great! My first run was using them for work while @ home, taking phone calls through Skype. My coworkers immediately noticed how clear my voice was (at work, they gave us the standard issue chat headset). Likewise, I was able to notice an immediate difference in dialog while I sat through meetings. After work was over, I decided to plug them into my personal gaming rig. I immediately thought about what software downloads may be available for these, and yes, there is “Roccat Neon” software, which will allow you to tune these headphones for your particular scenario. After configuring the 3D audio to Movie, I switched over to watching Loki Episode 4 and was immediately immersed. It does sound a whole lot better versus its Default setting. It does emphasize dialog and any frequencies in the upper range. I didn’t really get a sense of 3D audio, but it sure did sound amazing. I decided to try some music after. I configured 3D audio to Music. I’d say most would enjoy listening in this setting, especially if it’s recorded live. It does sound like a bit of reverb to simulate the 3D feel. Kinda like someone was singing in the somewhat echoey restroom. Still sounded dang good, especially when the bass drum hits, but for me it wasn’t my cup of tea as I prefer listening to the original track as it was recorded in the studio. There is EQ that you can customize if you have a preference in frequencies. Overall, I was still very happy listening to music with these on. Finally, I played a few games (COD BOCW, Halo MCC, SOTTR). In the Neon software, there is a “Superhuman Hearing” setting which will allow you emphasize footsteps and gunshots. Dang, it sure does. You can also activate 3D audio to Game if that works for you, but there is another mode called Game Spatializer which is another form of 3D audio specific to gaming?? You can’t have both 3D audio and Game Spatializer on. 3D audio set to Game just felt brighter overall, but the Game Spatializer actually felt more 3D. Finally, there is RGB on the headphones. Looking at the Neon software, it looks like you can’t sync to anything else outside of Roccat, but that seems true for most brands anyway. But the only mode you can set on these are Color Wave, or something called AIMO (Intelligent Lighting System). Pretty sure they’ll be updating this down the road. Overall, they’re comfy, simple to use outside of the software (only have On/Off, master volume and mic monitoring volume). Charging is done via USB-C and they provide the cable, but charging will be less frequent because they can hold a charge. They are wireless if you didn’t know already, and they had no problems keeping a solid connection. If you have a dedicated mic, you can remove the boom and cap the hole. If you choose to use the boom mic, know that it has an awesome feature to mute the mic when the boom is positioned vertical. I did it many times to mute myself during my work meetings. I’d say they’re pretty versatile overall, and with more software/driver updates, they will continue to get better. Cons? I did feel that the screen that protects the 50mm drivers felt like I could accidentally pierce it with my finger if I held it the wrong way. I'm mindful now to grab elsewhere when I pick these up. Pricewise, there are a lot of offerings for headphones. If you already own Roccat peripherals, then this would probably be a no-brainer, but for the rest of us, it’s definitely not a bad buy, especially with its versatility, which surprised me. I’ll probably find myself listening to music and watching movies on these more than anything, which isn’t a bad thing either."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Roccat headset is awesome! I have a few gaming headsets but this is my first pair of wireless gaming headets and I was wondering if there would be any trade off with the wireless feature…NONE! I don’t know about you but I do not game for 24 hours strait so the 24 hour battery life they claim is more than enough! I’m glad Roccat with USB C on these as well for charging…very fast. I knew the lighting would be cool just from the box but watching the crisp smooth lighting rotate through the colors is pretty sweet. I don’t use twitch really but these would definitely look the part if you were into that aspect. I just want great sound and functionality and the tactical advantages you gain from that and Roccat delivers that and then some! COD, Hitman, Fortnight all sounded amazing. They are also super lightweight and comfortable as well which means even after playing for 3 hours I forgot about them and was just immersed in the 3D sound. The 3D aspect of the audio was noticeable but if you are thinking that it will sound like a 5.1 surround sound you might be a little disappointed. They are on ear headphones and there is only so much audio drivers can do, so keep that in mind. I also liked that the headphone cups can rotate enough to lay flat. This ability is nice so if your spouse yells at you and you don’t hear what they are saying because the sound isolation is really good! It sounded like there was some noise cancelling tech involved but I did not read that on the box. Maybe it is the cup material which again is light and very comfortable. Anyway…They yell at you and you can easily take one cup off one ear and still maintain a perfect connection on the other ear! A real nice touch that I appreciate. I also really liked the boom mic set up and that you can opt not to have a mic even on the unit if you don’t want. There is a nice little plug that goes into the boom mic hole (see pics). Some times or on some games I don’t want it on there and it’s nice to have that versatility. The mic sounded great according to my opponents and I liked the on ear volume control for mic feedback through the headset. Very intuitive. I use these primarily for PC gaming but was curious if they worked with my ps4 and they did. I could not raise the volume as high as I would have liked on the PS4 with these but they sounded really good. The sound was only controllable through the PS4 settings. Roccat’s got a winner with these for sure! Great sound, supper lightweight and comfortable, long battery and slick lights and the overall build quality of the headset from the cups to the headband to the boom mic....all solid and well built! AWESOME!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Being marketed as a gamer headset, I am really pleased with the Syn Pros more subtle and refined rectangular design. The RGB lighting on the cups is not outrageously bright, which is a nice break from the usual. The matte black looks quite nice but will attract fingerprints. I appreciate that the mic is detachable and there is a cover to cover the input -adding to the headset’s rather stylish look. While these are almost entirely made of plastic, they seem well built, and certainly will stand normal use. The headband is flexible enough. The cups can fold inwards and be put down without concern. The control rockers spin effortlessly, and the buttons are tactile and easy to reach. The hinges seem sturdy as well, and the mic arm is strong and flexible. I wish the earpads were removable/replaceable as it is a concern should they become damaged or excessively dirty. I found the Syn Pro headphones surprisingly comfortable. Being mostly plastic, they are exceptionally light. The cups are small in size, but my ears fit well in them. I was worried that the stiff and rough fabric earpads were going to be a problem, but I have not yet experienced any friction issues. The headband cushion is also soft enough and did not cause any soreness. The clamping force is solid, but I would not shake my head too hard. The fabric earpads helped in keeping heat and sweat low. I definitely appreciated that I was able to wear glasses comfortably at all times. The 2.4 GHz connection is decent, and I was able to walk around in and out of my room without losing contact. I did not notice any real lag when playing or watching content. Also, you can always switch to a wired connection with the included USB-C cord and charge the set at the same time. Unfortunately, I did experience a weird issue where the sound was fine, but the controls stopped responding and I had to restart the headset. It isn’t a huge deal, but worth mentioning. Hopefully, Roccat will address this later with a firmware update. The battery life is respectable at 24 hours per charge and after 3 days of use, I still had 30% juice left. Just in case, there’s the quick-charge feature that adds 5 hours playback with just 15 minutes of charge. Out of the box, the 50mm drivers delivered a sound signature that I found a bit boring. I thought the bass was fine but lacked impact and sub-bass. The midrange was pushed forward a bit, and the treble was clear. Once I downloaded the Neon app, all that disappointment vanished. Once you activate the 3D audio (I prefer GAME), the bass became full, impactful, and had that subwoofer effect. The midrange appears ample, and the highs are pristine, adding clarity. The soundstage was also vastly improved and made it feel as if I was in a large, open area. Positional sounds were accurate not only when playing games, but also while watching movies. Although not audiophile quality, the music still was enjoyable. In case you still need to change the sound, the Neon app features a full EQ. While I didn’t care much for the super-human mode, I ended up rather impressed. The mic quality is also above average. Although I thought it needed a bit more bass, my voice was clear, smooth, and never broke up. Being on the premium side, I wish the Syn Pro would have featured Bluetooth as other brands have, including Turtle Beach’s own. Still, I do appreciate that the USB-C to USB-A adapter allows the headphones to work with my tablet, my phone, and consoles wirelessly. As you can tell I am quite happy with the Syn Pro headphones. While far from perfect, the sophisticated design, comfort, and excellent sound signature (with the app) make the Syn Pros a compelling gaming audio option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently tried the ROCCAT Syn Pro Air wireless PC gaming headset, and I was really impressed. The audio quality was fantastic, providing clear and immersive sound while gaming. The wireless connection worked flawlessly, allowing me to move freely without any interruptions. The headset was also extremely comfortable to wear, even during long gaming sessions. The built-in microphone was excellent, delivering clear and crisp voice communication. Overall, I highly recommend the ROCCAT Syn Pro Air for its impressive audio, seamless wireless performance, and comfortable design.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Functions the way it has to with no problem. Voice echos but overall great product for quality use.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] While not as well known name as Turtle Beach or Astro, these ROCCAT (owned by TB) headphones offer great quality and performance at significantly less cost. I've been using Astro A40s and those are really top notch headphones. They also cost twice as much as these ROCCAT too. I've flip flopped between wired/wireless headsets over the past years and, currently, am set on wired. They offer more consistent sound quality and don't disconnect during those crucial in-game moments. That said, this ROCCAT headset is pretty good in both quality and connectivity. My previous wireless headsets would disconnect, at least, twice during my daily gaming activities. Really annoying and never was quite sure why it always happened. This is the main reason I switched over to wired headsets. However, so far, I haven't experienced any connectivity issues with this headset which is great. I've played 4-5 gaming sessions and never had any disconnects so the sound kept pumping through. The fit of this headset is nice as well. I prefer the mesh earpads over leatherette ones since I don't have any sweat issues during long gaming sessions like I do with my A40s. The headset also feels lightweight too. Even after 3-4 hours of gameplay, I don't feel this headset on my head or weighing my head down like with the A40s. Sound quality is crisp and clear as one would expect. Biggest pro for me was the AIMO RGB lights. I've been on a tear recently with all things RGB and this headset just added that extra nice touch to my gaming rig. The lights are only on the bottom corner of the headset. Personally, I would've liked it to be a bit more prominent however this is fine. Overall, this is a lightweight, comfortable feeling headset which offers great sound quality AND RGB lighting. That and it being about half the price of some other top tier headsets should make this a great addition to any gaming setup.""]"

The app is intuitive and easy to use. The specs (here on Best Buy as well as Technics' own site -- you always have to double check Best Buy for errors) say Maximum Wireless Range is 33 feet, but using this with my Galaxy S23+ phone in a room at the rear of my house, I had no issues when I roamed to a room at the front of my house (distance was approximately 46 feet with several walls in between)."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Had these for about a year before one of the hinges broke. Good sound, battery life, and connectivity. Just cheapo construction. I filled a replacement claim and the company initially refused.

Basically, the company goes out of their way to prevent helping you.', 'thinking of other headphones at the same price point, these have the best looks, quality and battery life. Noise canceling and comfort is similar to the best out there. the sound on these is spot on. very clear with tight non muddy bass which I experienced with every other headsets.

Starting with the techniques they are super comfortable great build, have a great sound and allow you to control your headphones and software. My comments on the others.. Sony's were just a little too software oriented for me and the sound was good not great. I wanted something a little simpler I could operate with tactile buttons. Sennheiser sounded very good but you could not turn off ANC or disable the touch settings even though advertising said you could through software. The Grados sounded great partially because they're open which means no ANC but I was fine with that. The problem with the Grados were they were just too light had no clamping force and fell off constantly. Also the very thin sponge ear pads when I comfortable."", 'The headphones are very good in terms of the sound and functionality. It has features that I always wanted to have in one single headphones. Lately it has been turning the sound off on its own and the on and off function is a bit strange; too long to turn on or off. Not sure if the turning itself off issue has to do with the over head fitting bar.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great looking and sounding headphones.

SteelSeries Siberia Raw Prism Gaming Headset,$49.83,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/steelseries-siberia-raw-prism-gaming-headset/18484589/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headset feels comfortable and I love the color shift led feature. I own a pair of Razer Krakens (which are now broken) and the sound quality is a tad bit better on the raw prisms. I was going to get another kraken headset but I saw that these headphones were on sale ($40, originally $60) so I decided to get these. If I could change a few things about this product, I would make the microphone retractable and add some sort of volume-control button. Whenever I am playing an online game and cannot simply leave by tapping the windows key on my keyboard, I have to exit my game and lower/raise the volume.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound quality for the headphones themselves was just so poor. For as much as these cost, we would have thought they'd be a little better quality. However, if you can get past the sound issues, and want a very sensitive microphone that picks up EVERY background noise while you're in chat/vent from a quiet clock ticking on the wall (about 6 feet away), down to your cat making a noise in the other room, this is the headset for you! I however, couldn't manage to deal with it. Hopefully you'll have better luck! Happy they let me exchange it. We aren't normally fans of the Razer line, but the Razer headset we exchanged this one for was sufficient."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I absolutely love the sound in these, and I love the SteelSeries app that you can get to customize said sound and LED lights on the headset! Nothing could be better with these! Even comfortable and very user friendly. However, I would like to think the white casing of the headphones are quite fragile, I've learned. My cat, who is a Maine Coon, (so about 65 lbs) had jumped onto the chair where they were sitting and smashed them. Not completely, so I could still use them. But as I kept using them, I noticed the earphones sliding right off when I picked them up. So these cracks that my cat made got worse. So, a teensy bit fragile for a cat-owner, I think, but other than that? Excellent for the casual gamer."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Purchased a SteelSeries Siberia RAW headset as a gift for my little brother. I've used them from time to time, and love them. Although they are a PC gaming headset, they're fully compatible with the PS4. They sound amazing, and the integrated mic is a great convenience. The only cons; the wire on this headset is roughly 5 ft. long, which is perfect for PC gaming, but a tad on the short side for us console gamers. The integrated mic, no matter how convenient, picks up the audio from the speakers; although, I'm positive a small adjustment to your mic settings would fix this."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My husband and I love to play games together, and we have a few friends who we like to drag along on our adventures. Recently we've been playing a lot of League of Legends and have been looking for a good headset that wasn't too expensive since we have been short of funds. We got this with a gift card crossing our fingers and it works great! No fuzzy feedback and its pretty simple to use; just a USB plug in and bam, done. Biggest draw back is when you have them on almost ALL sound is blocked out. Some might find that a good thing but when I'm less than a foot away and have to scream for my husband to hear me it kind of sucks (and no he wasn't ignoring me, he was talking to me and too lazy to remove the headset)."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I went and got some 3H Steel series ones first that were a little cheaper and ended up taking them back the very next day.

Cord is plenty long enough unlike the last pair i bought and its on the Left ear piece along with the MIC The mic doesn't extract but everyone in game can hear me perfectly. Colors are awesome too. They are not tight on my head either and i have a larger head. Nice and soft. I have only used them probably 2 or 3 hours at a time with no issues at all. Great sound too. These are perfect to snag up. Highly recommend them"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was looking for something not quite leathery looking, more breathable. I love how the earphones feel and I dont sweat wearing them. Very nice sound. Used them for a couple weeks and still perfect for the price. The colors really dont matter as you cannot see them, while you are wearing them, but the company engine is all about customization so I turned the colors off. Have not tried the built in mic yet though. I would recommend for those annoyed by synthetic type ear covering. Allows your ears to breath and not sticky. Awesome and for the price is really nice.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought my son these headphones for his birthday to be able to talk to his friends on line. When we got home from the store he went straight to his room and started to use them. About an hour after we got home I went to see how he liked them. All he kept saying was how clear his friends were and how comfortable the headphones felt on his head. Later that night, after he went to bed, I went into his room to check on him. There he was, fast asleep, with the headphones still on his head. He fell asleep listening to music. That's how comfortable they are. :)"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this headset to replace the turtle beach set that my toddler destroyed.

I would love to buy a exact replica of this set minus the colors that seem to attract my son quite well.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The headphones are very easy to use with the plug and play USB connection. The mic is built in so there is nothing to break off or move around which is nice. The volume control is not on the USB cable, but on the computer controls for the headphones. Overall, the sound quality is very good but the noise cancelling could be better. One major drawback from the Turtle Beach headphones is that the USB cord is very short, so I can't walk around the room like I used to and listen to music while I am cleaning on them.""]"
"JVC - Hybrid Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones, Built-in Microphone and Remote, Black",$272.8,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-hybrid-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-built-in-microphone-and-remote-black/19194033/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been trying JVC’s Hybrid Over Ear ANC headphones for a few weeks and I’m not overly impressed by them. I consider myself an audiophile and listen to a variety of genres, for which go to great lengths to get the best sound quality to enjoy them with. Unfortunately, these headphones do not meet these needs. The headphones work well, the problem is an overemphasis on the bass to the expense of mids and treble. This causes the music to sound muddled, as well as lose clarity and balance in tones. For music such as rock, it is a major issue. This is not to say all music will suffer from this, but those who seek euphony through high-fidelity audio will notice the difference. ANC The active noise cancelation is okay, I can still hear sounds outside of the headphones. It works to block out overall ambient sound but voices and noises that are in proximity come through pretty clearly still. Ambient The ambient setting works great when there is no music playing and works decently when I am listening to a video or podcast. I can hear what is going on around, albeit at a lower tone. However, I cannot hear much when music is playing. The mic is too subtle in bringing in the ambient sound unless it is loud, like a fan (cooking, bathroom, cooling fans all were highly audible), voices hardly come through with music. Wind Cut This was a feature I only found through the app and is quite efficient. It completely removes any noise of wind, even if I am standing directly in front of a fan. Mic The mic picks up voice clearly, I have no issues with it, even when speaking in a low tone. Construction The material is very lightweight slightly textured plastic. It smudges easily with the natural oils on my fingers. The ear pads are comfortable to wear, and the headphones fits snugly over my ears without putting any undesirable pressure on my head. The top of the headphone band has same plastic cushion material for comfort. The headphones feel overall well-made, but I question the longevity of the materials used. App These headphones are compatible with the JVC Headphones app. The app allows some customization, like what the NC button toggles through, along with what the power and MFB buttons can do. It also allows the sound mode to be changed from flat, bass, clear, or a custom setting. The custom setting allows frequency, gain, and Q to be changed. None of these sound modes have helped much with the clarity of sound though. Overall I am underwhelmed by the quality of material and sound from these headphones. They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods and okay starters, to give as gifts to teenagers, or occasional listeners perhaps, but anyone who desires high fidelity sound should pass on these.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I wear headphones or earbuds a lot and I have different pairs for either different occasions or uses. And I just got the JVC Hybrid ANC HAS95NB headphones, and not only do they look great, but they also sound great. First, the packaging is recyclable so that was a good start, then right out of the box the JVC HAS95NB look great with their matte black finish, they also feel well made, and the materials feel long lasting. I can charge them with the USB A to USB C cable that is included. When it comes to the quality of the sound, they sound great; the highs are clear, they deliver full mids, as well as deep bass but not overwhelming. I can either listen to podcasts to a wide range of music that I do listen to, the JVC HAS95NB deliver a great audio experience due to their 36mm driver. Once paired with my phone, I downloaded the JVC app and there I can customize the audio modes, flat, bass, clear and 3 other custom choices, the eq is limited to 3 band but works well. I can also control the volume and also turn on and off the noise cancelling, wind cut and ambient sound. I also like that I can see the battery percent and life remaining on them. Since they have active noise cancellation (ANC) they do keep me focused when I want to. They do a great job on helping me do that by reducing background noise, so for example if I am editing a video at a café, I can stay focused on the task at hand. They have a wind cut mode as well as ambient modes so depending on my environment I can change them accordingly. So, for example when I am hiking or running, I can use the wind cut mode and when I want to know what is going on around me the ambient mode is helpful. I also like the up to 50 hours of life and 35 hours with Noise Cancelling battery life, it is more than enough for me, I do not need to keep charging them and they are ready to come with me at any time. The JVC headphones are nicely comfortable and lightweight to wear from a short period to all day long. The earpads are ergonomic and they feel very soft on my ears. Also, they are not tight on my head, yet they work well, the buttons are soft and easy to reach and control. The JVC app is also helpful it shows plenty of information including battery life, firmware updates the headphones, switching the sound mode as well as customizing. I can turn on off the noise cancelling as well as the wind cut or even the ambient sound. When it comes to calls, I made one indoors and it was good but I also made a call outside when it was windy and I could hear the wind and the other person at the other end did hear a lot of noise, I am not sure if I had the wrong setting or maybe it was too windy but I did not like the outdoor call. Overall, the JVC Hybrid ANC HAS95NB headphones are much better than I expected I have a few JVC speakers, and they sound great and now the JVC headphones and they are a great addition to a good high quality sound experience. The JVC do offer great noise cancellation as well as comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Over the past year, I’ve been fortunate enough to work with the Best Buy TIN Program to review a wide range of gadgets — with a large portion being headphones. These products have varied in price, durability, and quality. That being said, I still wouldn’t consider myself a huge audiophile. I would, however, consider myself to be a home theater & music enthusiast who keeps an eye (and ear) out for the newest high-quality products. Packaging This week, I received the new JVC Hybrid Noise Cancelling HA-S95N wireless headphones for review. In the box comes a 3.5 mm headphone jack, USB-C to USB charging cable, user manual, and warranty info. Pretty bare bones and slightly disappointing for reasons I will cover shortly. Design Right out the gate, the most notable feature is how lightweight the HA-S95N’s are. While this is fantastic when wearing them for an extended period of time, it is a bit concerning when considering durability. The cans are made of smooth, matte black plastic. The headband and ear cushions are made of a thin memory foam. The lack of a carrying case in the box is especially surprising with just how fragile they feel. Quite honestly, it’s disappointing. For the headphones themselves, the left side has a Power button, USB-C charging port, and a 3.5mm input. The right side has volume buttons, a multi-function button (pause/ play, next), and a Noise Cancel (NC) button. There’s a small LED that turns white or blue for power on and Bluetooth, respectively. A positive though is how much range you can get from the headband. I’ve tried a lot of headphones where the headband seems to be a little too tight and unable to extend for people with larger heads. That is not the case here, which is great for the purported 50hr playtime (35hr w/ active Noise Cancellation). Sound Quality Prior to listening to any audio, I downloaded the “JVC Headphones” app as stated on the outside box. I connected the headphones to my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra via Bluetooth and played my favorite songs for demoing. I initially tested the R&B song “Ascension” (Don’t Ever Wonder) by Maxwell. The song’s Dolby Atmos mix on Apple Music has such dynamic soundscapes — with magical high-end sounds and a deep, groovy baseline — and is great for testing the range of any audio device. With the app loaded and all presets left alone, I immediately noticed just how overly warm and muffled the S95N’s were. This seems to be for two reasons: 1.) BT listening only maxed out to 16-bit audio @44.1kHz, which is essentially stereo CD quality. 2.) The preset out of the box is set on “FLAT”. This may be fine for those less discerning, but anyone who has experienced 24-Bit high-fidelity audio would be slightly underwhelmed. While cycling through “FLAT, CLEAR, and BASS”, I was only able to hear distinct differences with the “BASS” preset. There was a significant thump on the low end. There are 3 slots for custom presets, but this is where I make the delineation between audiophile and music enthusiast (with me being the latter). You have to have a good understanding of audio EQ to give these headphones any semblance of hi-fi audio. The ideal media for these would be podcasts. Noise Cancelling Of all the features, Noise Cancellation appears to be THE best! During my time of testing, there were many instances where I couldn’t hear my wife walk into the room. The app allows you to toggle between “Noise Cancelling”, “Wind Cut”, “Off”, and “Ambient Sound”. All of them perform as exactly as advertised. Wind Cut works great for a room with a loud air conditioner or a car ride. Conclusion To summarize, the JVC Hybrid S95N headphones are most suitable for casual music and podcast listeners. The quality noise cancellation makes for a perfect escape from the noisy morning public transit commute. The lightweight build material feels great when wearing for extended periods of time, albeit a little too fragile when not in use. The biggest factors working against this product are the lack of hi-res audio and a carrying case. However, these are more than adequate for the average music listener. 2.75/5', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you’re after budget-friendly noise-canceling headphones, the JVC - Over-the-Ear Headphones HAS95NB might be worth a look. I’ll admit, my initial impression wasn't sky-high. The packaging felt cheap, with a flimsy box and minimal cardboard inserts, but the headphones themselves surprised me. They’re exceptionally lightweight, which makes a big difference if you’re wearing them for long periods. The thick, soft padding on the ear cups is a real comfort booster—these practically disappear on your head after a while, making them ideal for home lounging, light commutes, or casual city strolls. Sound quality is respectable. While they’re not going to thrill audiophiles, they offer good bass and treble for a pair in this price range. They’re perfect for working from home, walking, or just relaxing to some tunes. However, the noise canceling is underwhelming. With the noise-canceling mode on, I could still hear my kids talking word for word and pick up even soft sounds like finger snaps or keyboard taps. The ambient noise mode was similarly subtle—it felt like switching off noise canceling entirely rather than enhancing my awareness. If you’re considering these for a plane or a loud environment, you might find the noise canceling doesn’t quite meet expectations. But for anyone looking for a simple, easy-to-use pair with decent sound and comfort, these headphones hold up. They connect smoothly via Bluetooth, feature a 3.5mm jack for wired use, and the buttons are well-placed and user-friendly. While these may not be the pinnacle of noise-canceling technology, they’re a perfect budget option for general use."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC Over Ear Hybrid ANC HAS95NB Headphones are a great choice. I know that sound is subjective, but they have a decent sound out of the box, although it could be more on the flat side. Thankfully through the JVC Headphones app gives you access to three presets, Flat, Bass, and Clear. But what's even better is that you have access to three more custom profiles and you are able to specifically pick three frequencies to dial in your sound. You can also adjust the Q factor which gives your even more ability to dial in the sound to your liking. You also get ANC and Ambient Sound. To be honest, the noise canceling works, but it's not the best I've tested out. The HAS95NB's are also very comfortable. I wear glasses and was able to listen to a three hour podcast with no fatigue. I will say that they did warm my ears up quite a bit. As far as battery life goes, they advertise 35 hours, and I've been using them off on for the past week listening to padcasts and music, and the battery is still at 84%. The microphone also works pretty well. I like that you have the ability to disable the Ambient Sound option during calls. That is a pet peeve of mine. Especially because I tend to use earbud and headphones in noisy environments."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are nice sounding and comfortable headphones. I have a smallish head so sometimes, over the head headphones are gigantic and uncomfortable on me. They are lightweight at less than 7oz and are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, long flight, etc. They were very easy to pair with my phone and tablet, as they ask for Bluetooth pairing as soon as you turn them on. They do have multipoint connection and paired with both devices which makes it easy to switch back and forth from phone to tablet. They have a microphone embedded if you want to use for call/video meetings and other meeting participants said I sounded fine. I use them mostly for cutting out background noise and listening to music and watching movies on flights. The sound quality is good and they seem to get plenty loud (at least for me). There is a “sound control” button that adjusts the sound from regular, to bass, to flat. Honestly, I didn’t hear a huge difference between regular and flat and have just left them on “bass” which sounds the best to me. Music has good clarity. Movies were clear and with good and realistic stereo sounds. I could hear every little whisper. ANC (active noise canceling) works well and tuned out most sounds (especially airplane hum!) while on a recent flight. They claim to have 50 hour life as they are wireless, but I have not had a chance to push them to their limits, but so far they’ve easily lasted through a full day at work and a full day of travel. According to specs, battery life is about 30% less if you have noise cancelling turned on (says up to 35 hours). Thankfully they have a USB-C charging port. Note that the charging cable they come with is pretty short, but we have plenty of these USB-C cables so no big deal. Charging indicator is simple - light on when charging and light off when fully charged. They also come with a 3.5mm audio cord which is great if you want to plug into the back of a seat on an airplane or some other non-Bluetooth audio source. They fold flat for slimmer storage profile, but there is no case included (nor does there appear to be one available or recommended on the JVC web page.) I will have to get an aftermarket case online to protect these while traveling in my carryon bag.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC HAS95N are a general use lightweight noise cancelling Bluetooth Headphone. The headphones have a decent battery life at 50 hours (35 hours with noise cancelling) and have a wide range of compatibility thanks to its Bluetooth and 3.5mm connection options. The headphones can be used right out of the box or can be paired with the JVC headphone app to tweak some buttons and settings. I used the headphones while cleaning my house, working in the office, doing yardwork, and building a deck. That’s fairly broad usage case for these headphones – low to high ambient noise environments and long wear periods. With each mode I could put the different noise cancelling modes to the test. There’s 4 modes – Off, Wind Cut, Ambient, and Noise Cancelling. Off is pretty self-explanatory. The other modes use the earcup mounted microphones (1 per earcup) to listen to your surroundings. Ambient passes surrounding noise through without much processing. Wind Cut follows the same process and Ambient, but does some additional processing that targets wind noise. Noise Cancelling does just that – it cuts out ambient noise and isolates you. In practice the Ambient mode works well. I feel like it could pump up the passthrough volume a bit more, but I also don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything. Noise Cancelling is just OK – it doesn’t isolate me as well as other noise cancelling headphones and earbuds I own. I can still make out conversations around me and hear the TV that’s on in the same room as me. It works fine in a quieter environment, but it misses the mark when it comes to blocking out noise from my kids while I’m trying to work. The Wind Cut mode is interesting in that it allows for passthrough, but it cuts wind noise out. I say its interesting because it does decently better than the Noise Cancelling mode against wind noise. I actually liked this mode when walking my dogs on a breezy day. I need the passthrough to listen for cars and my surroundings, but I really appreciate the wind noise getting blocked. Sound processing can be adjusted via 3 presets or 3 custom EQ’s that you can create in the app. The presets are Flat, Clear, and Bass. Bass bumps up the lower end sound, Flat is a flat EQ profile, and Clear bumps up the higher end sounds. Clear works great for podcasts and other vocal heavy media. Flat is your basic EQ and its what the headphones use right out of the box. Bass adds a little depth to the bottom end the sound spectrum, and its what I prefer when listening to music. The low end boost I noticeable in this mode. The presets can be cycled through on the headset by clicking the power button. You can change up the presets the button cycles through in the app, so if you never use a preset you can removed it from the cycle list. You can also add your custom EQ’s to the cycle list, which is a nice touch. Sound quality from the headphones is decent. They are fairly mid-range when it comes to performance. I have used several Bluetooth headphones in this price range, and these I feel are right in the middle of the pack. Nothing groundbreaking but they do a good job. The bass reproduction is decent, but could go a little stronger. Where it falls down a bit is the highs can get a little too sharp. I found myself turning the volume down on higher pitched media. The headphones don’t sound hollow or tinny in any way, but they are just missing out on a little bit of soundstage depth. The sound quality remains the same when switching over to the 3.5mm cable, so it’s not a Bluetooth limitation. These were perfectly fine for day to day listening and I think most will be more than happy with the sound quality, but don’t expect audiophile grade sound. The headset worked out fine for making calls. The headset mic port is on the left earcup – it’s a pinhole opening. The mic doesn’t do too bad of a job – calls came in clear and my voice was just fine while talking in an office environment. Using the headphones while walking my dogs introduced a lot of background noise and wind, so they aren’t great at background isolation. However, that has pretty much been my experience with every headset and earbud – hard to beat a boom mic with a wind screen. Comfort of the headset is really good. The earcups are circumaural in design so they go completely around your ears. They also use some fairly supple padding, which makes them comfortable to wear even with my glasses on. The lightweight nature of the headset along with the plush padding of the headband makes them comfortable for long sessions. I wore them for several hours at work without any issue. Wearing them for my outdoor work went great as well. The earcups being a leatherette material does mean you can get a little sweaty since they trap the heat. That’s just the nature of the material selection. The earcups are removable so chances are there are different earpad options out there if you’d like to change it up. This also bodes well for replacing the earcups over time as they will eventually wear out and peel like all leatherette earcups eventually do. Overall, JVC HAS95NB are a good pair of headphones. They are very comfortable to wear for long sessions, and didn’t cause any discomfort with my glasses on. Sound quality is decent and the headphones do a good job on sound reproduction. They certainly could be better, but they are comfortably mid-range on sound quality, which is fine. The battery life out of the headset is more than enough to get someone through several days worth of listening sessions before needing to recharge. I like that they still include a 3.5mm port which keeps it compatible with older media players and even Xbox controllers.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall there isn’t anything that is really exciting with these headphones. The overall build quality is good, the sound quality is ok, the fit and feel is tolerable, the controls are bare minimum and the noise cancellation actually works better than I expected. Having said that there isn’t anything terribly wrong with them either especially for headphones in this price range. Pros: - Lightweight and comfortable fit - Good ANC for headphones in this price range - Long Battery life - Can pair with two devices at the same time – I have them connected to my pc as well as my phone in case I get a call - Informative voice prompts and notifications Cons: - Can get warm over time due to the enclosed earmuffs - Limited audio presets - Lots of plastic and no case or storage bag - No App to control the headphones or configure options Performance: The Noise Cancellation was the main positive with these headphones, it does a good job isolating you from background noise. While the overall audio quality was good the limited presets and lack of equalizer options in an app really restrict your ability to tune the sound quality. Taking calls with the headphones worked reliably but the microphone feedback into the headphones so you can hear your voice when you speak sounded a little tinny for me. Fit and Feel: Because these headphones are so light there isn’t much padding in the support arm nor is it needed. The earcups are made of soft leatherette type material and they sit comfortably over my ears even though I wear glasses. The headset is made mostly of black plastic so they aren’t very flashy. The on/off button and an optional audio jack is on the Left earcup with the Noise Cancellation, Media and Volume control buttons on the Right earcup. The media button lets you toggle between three preset equalizers Flat, Bass and Clear as well as perform the typical media functions. I have mine set for Bass and overall the music and audio is acceptable. One complaint I have is that these buttons are flush with the sides of the earcup so they can be difficult to differentiate.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Got these for my kid to replace another cheap pair of noise canceling headphones of a diff brand that only lasted a year before completely dying. Saw these at the store and considered the price and was hoping they’d at least have a decent noise canceling but it’s virtually non existent. The kid says they’re still okay for now but we will see. The noise cancelling is important for neurodivergent kids to be able to shut out some noise but obviously don’t want to buy a kid $200 headphones. That said, the kid says the sound quality is very good and crystal clear, so hoping that compensates for the lack of actual noise canceling.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JVC's hybrid noise-cancelling headphones are lightweight and feature construction and design that are great for comfort and all-day usage. The pads on the ear tips provide terrific comfort. The technology to block ambient noise and to enjoy an uninterrupted audio experience is pretty solid for a product in this price range. There are customizable audio modes: normal, bass, and clear. With the option to further personalize your audio experience via the JVC app. Rechargeable battery boasts a 35-hour playtime with noise cancelling activated when charged fully. A detachable 3.5mm cable makes it possible to enjoy music on a stereo or other devices that still feature this kind of connection. The biggest elements unfortunately working against this product is lack of high-quality audio and a muffled sound. These headphones seemed to work fine for TV viewing and podcast listening. Notably this product lacks a carrying case. While these headphones are fine for listeners on a budget and the average music listener, however those wanting to experience the best of hi-res lossless audio or a good pair of headphones to plug into a stereo will be sorely disappointed.""]"

Very beautiful headphones, unlike the previous version that were very large, these are small in size. The sound is perfect, clear and crystalline, listening to the songs that I previously listened to with the headphones of another very famous brand, with these Bose they feel details, musical instruments that I don't feel. The batteries last a lot, since I have loaded them only once. The app is simply used but complete with each function. The Active Noise Control once activated isolates you from the world, you don't feel anything, only your favorite music. For me they are perfect."", 'I have had these about a week or so and I love them comfortable long lasting charge great base! A must buy', 'Loyal bose customer and as always this product is awesome', ""I was looking forward to trying these as I have the wired Bose headphones and love their noise cancelling feature. I was not disappointed. Unboxing them I noticed how neat the design was and how little plastic was used in the packaging which makes a change. There are 2 more sets of ear bud covers to custom fit them to your ear size and a C charging cable included. I love that the case holds extra charge unlike some brands, the only thing missing is that they are not magnetic charger compatible but I can forgive that. Pairing them to my phone was very easy and using the touch function on the buds rather than having to fish my phone out of my pocket is a nice touch. Music quality was fantastic, you can adjust the sound to your taste using the graphic equaliser on the app or just go with pre set settings. No overly basey or tinny sounds just crystal clear good sounding tones that you expect from Bose. The noise cancelling is amazing, I honestly didn't think it would be as good as my wired headphones but it is. I cannot fault it and found it superior to my other ear buds. Call quality was clear, back ground noise was diminished so I could hear the caller and they could hear me, again I cannot fault this feature and found its quality superior to my current ear buds. They are a little chunkier than some earbuds bud they're not heavy and feel very secure in your ears. Wether you're walking, running or just laid in bed they don't budge and are comfortable. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is thinking about purchasing earbuds, if you want good quality, good tones, clarity and excellent noise cancelling these are winners in my eyes...and ears."", ""I was looking forward to trying these as I have the wired Bose headphones and love their noise cancelling feature.

I love the sound quality when listening to music and watching movies. However, I'm super duper disappointed and the quality of a phone conversation. The person on the other line can never hear when I'm saying. They say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. My mom always asks me if I'm in a bathroom. I sound like this when I'm talking in the car on my way to work or on my way home. I have to turn off my air conditioning so the person on the other line can hear what I'm saying. I live in Arizona and it's summer time. That's not going to work. Even with my air conditioning turned off, the conversation is not 100% clear. I looked in the settings to see if maybe I could fix it. I have had no luck. They were pricey. Too pricey to have a phone conversation not be successful. Really bummed out."", ""Sound quality is Phenomenal. Sound cancelations superb. I can't here you if you next to me talking or the baby won't stop crying.

I am still trying to make this product work for me."", ""The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II are just amazing. They are light and fit tight in the ear feeling very secure while not being cumbersome. The noise cancelling is light and blocks out just enough ambient noise while listening to create a very immersive experience. Music is surprisingly crisp and clear with astonishing levels of bass. They are by far the best sounding earbuds I've ever tried. The smartphone app is clean and easy to navigate. All the settings are within a couple clicks.

I bought mine from Best Buy in June 2024 and had issues with mine by early December 2024. Since they were past the 30-day standard return window with Best Buy I was instructed to contact Rayon directlyfor a warranty claim to get an RMA to return for exchange. It's been almost a month and even after attempting follow ups with Raycon, aside from an auto-reply for the initial claim I haven't heard a peep. For the clearly lacking after-sales warranty support I cannot recommend these headphones to anyone."", ""Don't bother with these Raycon headphones, or any for that matter. I bought these thinking of I had any issues with them within the 1 year manufacturer warranty I could return them, at least to Raycon. Just 6 months later the left speaker suddenly constantly squealed with feedback no matter what mode they were in unless I turned them off. Tried contacting Raycon but Canada return under warranty links (tried international as well) were dead, and no response using their email. Junk. You get what you pay for, I suppose, only good thing about them was the long battery life. But now I have no noise blocking and have to return to the world of overwhelming noise Iwas happily exempt from for 6 months, I just hope the ringing in my left ear stops. Absolute garbage quailty."", ""Where HAVE these been all my life? I was looking for an economical alternative to many AuDHD, ADHD, Autism organisation-endorsed Active Noise Cancelling headphones for ages but during that time the prices were astronomical. As if those of us who suffer from Auditory Overstimulation are all rich or something. I thought, then, well, fine, if they work, maybe I'll splurge maybe about $500 to finally get some relief from NOISE, especially as there is some local construction that will probably be around for the summer, if not even into the autumn. And I'm already losing my mind (noise cancelling earbuds and earplugs not an option for me as I have sensitive eardrums and am susceptible to chronic ear infections). Then I came across these. For the price I was almost on board, but first I had to look at online reviews, and not just on Best Buy. One site had a reviewer who specifically stated that they bought them for their boyfriend who gets overstimulated and he just loves them. That sold me, and I came back to order a pair at the sale price. Got them today and love them. I might still buy a different pair down the road (maybe the Pro version of these, will have to dig deeper at that time) as the ANC relies on the headphones being connected to a Bluetooth device to work, otherwise it keeps running in Pairing Mode but then shuts the headphones off if it doesn't find anything. There's no way to turn the pairing mode off as it comes on automatically once you power them on. Still, for the times I need to isolate myself, it's a small inconvenience. For now, I simply have the headphones paired to my phone while it's plugged in with Bluetooth access on, while in DND mode. HOWEVER, I haven't tried plugging the 3.5mm cable into anything yet, I suspect that might actually be a solution in lieu of using up battery power on both my phone and the headphones with Bluetooth on. I'd imagine the headphones would stop the pairing mode if the jack is plugged in, right? LOL Either way, these are finally blocking out months of sounds that have been going right through me and driving my brain insane. Peace and quiet, it's blissful. Do yourself a favour, though, google for the real manual as the insert included is just a display of icons likely meant for highly tech-savvy folks not reliant on a magnifying glass.

Sound performance is balanced, with clear mids and highs, but bass can feel a bit underwhelming for those seeking a punchier low end. The earbuds are also IPX4-rated for sweat and water resistance, making them suitable for workouts. Overall, they are a solid choice for casual listeners who prioritize affordability and convenience over premium features.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am impressed with my new skullcandy wireless earbuds. The case is extremely lightweight, and the earbuds are so comfortable in your ear! It comes with multiple size cushions so you can choose the most comfortable fit for you. It was easy to set up. I like the feature that it states the battery level right when you put it in your ears. I have had problems with other companies, not knowing that they were low battery until they died on me.

I've tried a lot of different headphones, and these are my new favorite ones! I like the sleek color of these too! Also, when working out or working these stay in place without any worries."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] while I do appreciate the premium sound quality and compact design, I am disappointed with the overall experience. The Skull-iQ Smart Feature TechnologyTM is a great addition, but I found that it didn't always work reliably, and the earbuds would occasionally disconnect or struggle to pair with my device. Additionally, the touch controls were finicky and not as intuitive as I had hoped. While the price point is reasonable for a premium earbud, I think there are other options on the market that offer a more seamless and user-friendly experience. Overall, I give the Skullcandy Meet Rail earbuds three stars for their great sound quality and design, but frustrating user experience."", ""I got this product last Saturday, and I have been experiencing nothing but issues since I unboxed it after I got home. Sometimes the earbuds just pauses the music for no reason, or even one ear just stops working. Since last week, I have been using several troubleshooting methods, but none seem to work or even last long. Today, making it a week, I experienced another where it now only plays music and not audio from other apps. and this confuses me cause no settings have been changed at all and the earbuds are always fully charged and up-to-date (in terms of software update).

Now I just took them off and they fit fine, but the extra hassle was unnecessary. The buttons were responsive and clicky. Now the audio quality was higher than what I expected. Not that I was expecting Sony WF1000XM3 quality, but still. The bass was definitely there, but the mids were hidden behind a tidal wave of highs. The snares and the cimbals came out very strong.

The noise cancellation is out of the world. doesn’t let any noise in. The leather ear-cups are so soft and puffy, it feels like you’re wearing a pillow. The mic is crystal clear. The best part is having a mute button. It is so easy to mute yourself when you’re not near your laptop.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love everything about JBL’s best gaming headset I have ever used. First off, when unboxing the Quantum 810 wireless, they have the coolest look with “JBL” that lights up different colors on each side. They are inside of a nice bag to keep them from getting scratched and keep dust off of them when not in use. They are so comfortable when you put them on, you would have to put them on to appreciate how comfortable they really are. I imagined that’s what a fluffy cloud would feel like, when I put them on. Way more so comfortable than any other headset I’ve ever used and I’ve used a lot over the years. Now the sound quality, with surround sound and with the full active noise canceling, pretty much blew my mind. The sound is so amazing and I feel like I’m in a movie theater with perfect crisp sound all around. I absolutely love it!! You don’t have to do anything to connect them to your devices. The Bluetooth automatically connects when you turn them on. You can’t get any easier than taking the product out and just turning it on and it’s ready to go. The charger is included and it’s very nice and sturdy. It’s made like a “rope” plus the handbook for using is included in the box. There is nothing I would change about JBL’s Quantum 810 wireless gaming headset because it is literally the best I’ve ever had in every way. I know they will last forever because everything from JBL has lasted me for years and I’ve never had a problem. If you want the best quality, sound and superior comfort made, I highly recommend this product. I’m sure this is the last headset I want to use for years to come. It’s that good.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Quantum 810 are a pretty decent pair of gaming cans.The Quantuum 810s sound is crisp and clear ,what i like is the surround soud feature and good stereo separation. The Quantum 810 has decent active noise canceling feature, i also like the fact i can lift up the mine to mute and put it back down to continue conversations. The Quantum 810 has a cool light feature that lights up JBL logo. To sum it up these are decent pair of gaming headphones with great sound.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I may not be a hardcore gamer, but these headphones may just change that. The sound quality and 3D feel of these is amazing. I use them with an Xbox, so I'm wired, but with the included wire, that has controls on the wire, you're good to go. This also comes with a Bluetooth dongle device for your PC. They also work great for just listening to music. They feel super comfortable on your head and ears with plenty of padding in all places. The led lights make them fun to wear in the dark and even better for guests to see. I can't find a single thing I don't love about these headphones!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] With the current gaming headphones market it's hard to decide which set fits best for you. What sets the Quantum 810 apart from the competitors is the ANC (active noise cancelling), the custom RGB effects, and the overall quality of the product. Even though they're mostly made of plastic, the Quantums feel nice and durable and the looks match as well, sleek and clean. Comfort is an important factor, after a long session of gaming there's little to no discomfort with these beasts. The active noise canceling is a real game changer (literally haha), it allows for more focus on the game, especially if you have to share a household with other people using TV's. Also love that the mic can be moved out of the way easily and automatically mutes while in the upward position. Thge customizability of the RGB lighting is a really great feature, I'm able to match it to my computer and my keyboard using the JBL Quantum app, as well as adjust the sound settings for the headphones. One of the coolest additions to the Quantums is their ability to be used as regular headphones too! Bluetooth connectivity and a 3.5mm audio jack allows for use on phones whether its for music or streaming. The Quantum 810s leave little to be desired in the features department and that's why I consider them one of the best headphones. 10/10"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] PROS: First and foremost the sound quality on these headphones is amazing. JBL always has great sound, but the 3D surround sound is incredible, really brings the games to life. The headset is comfortable, but right out of the box I thought they were a little on the heavy side. But after a couple uses, I don’t feel that way anymore. The mic automatically mutes when you lift it up, and there’s an audible click to confirm. The mic voice quality is excellent. The volume control is a dial instead of a button, which is an unexpected game changer for me. The lights on the side are a really cool feature, but they drain the battery a lot faster, so I generally keep them off. They come with a dust cover and some really nice, high quality charging and audio cables. These headphones can charge while being used, which is a huge plus for people who always forget to charge their devices (me). CONS: They are kinda bulky and really stick out on my head. I look like I belong on a Nascar pit crew. The only reason I list that as a con is because I was hoping to use these headphones for my work conference calls and zoom meetings, but I have a feeling I’ll look a little ridiculous in a serious work meeting…. There is an occasional lag when using the Bluetooth connection. When I use the included USB dongle to connect, it’s perfect.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First impression out of the box is that these are very high quality. They have a solid feel and fit my head very comfortably. They are kind of heavy compared to other headsets, but the clear sound and noise cancelling options far out weigh that. The spatial surround sound is pretty amazing, I play some car racing games, and to here the other cars around you like that is a whole ne experience. The feature I love the most is automatic mic muting, so easy to use. Battery life is good, I only need to charge maybe once a week.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Quantum 810 is a great wireless gaming headset. It's sound isolating closed ear design helps block out any unwanted background noise that interferes with your gaming or listening experience. I use my Quantums to help block out the sound of a loud fan blowing in the background which helped immerse myself into the game. The dual sound channel is also a great feature. Being able to adjust whether I hear my WoW guildies on discord more or the game more clearly is a great ability. I only have 1 minor complaint; my ears got sweaty after having the headset on for about 3 hours straight. But that probably means I should take more breaks. Overall the Quantum 810 is a fantastic wireless headset and a great entry into the market. It is light weight, easy to use and connect, has clear sound, has customizable RGBs, and most importantly easy to use external volume controls."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBl Quantum 810 are at a whole another level. While playing on my PS5 console using the 2.4 USB, the 3D audio sound is very clear and surround immersive with no lag or drops at all. The (ANC) active noise cancelation is a great feature with a female talk voice telling you wether it's on or off. They feel very light and comfortable over the ears with no discomfort from long play. I also noticed the battery life is long, lasting hours without needing a charge. The led lights around the outside of each ear cups and JBL logos are a very nice touch with a waving color effect. The chrome color is eye catching but can be a slight fingerprint magnet. The small 2.4 wireless usb adapter has a connect button on the side, which is a really nice feature too. It connects quickly to the headset with no issues at all. The headset can be also connected via bluetooth. The microphone has a small visable mute red led indicator at the end of the boom that turns on when you lift the microphone or push the mute button on the headset. The microphone is very clear. The controls are very easy to adjust at a fingers reach. It also comes with a nice light headset storage bag. JBL definitely thought it over and created a great gaming headset with lots of features for gaming consoles. Overall, I am very impressed with the quality, feel, weight and performance of the JBL Quantum 810."", ""I purchased this item I'd say 3 days ago, everything was great the audio is wonderful and everything id expect from a jbl product, but theres modes you can have your headphones in and one mode i like to have my headphones in is anc its a really great feature. Sadly, I cant enjoy this mode for apparently having all your hz's (31hz, 62hz, 125hz, etc...) maxed out it messes with the mode and bugs the right headphone causing it to make a terrible treble noise like a blown speaker. Now I go about my days without it on and so far not an issue but please get this fixed. Id like to be able to enjoy these headphones at the standards they're expected to be held. P.s. id like to mention i didnt have this issue when initially having everything maxed and anc on.""]"

Marshall Motif II In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Black,$229.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/marshall-motif-ii-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-black/18339579/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall really hit another one out of the park when they made the Marshall Motief II A.N.C.in the ear headphones. I call them earbuds. Straight out of the box, set up and listening to my music on my iPhone in under 5 minutes. The Marshall Bluetooth app is the app you want to download to take full control of the degree on noise cancelation and degree of ambient sounds you let through. You also can customize what touch and tap features work where on the earbuds with the app as well. The ""Front Row"" sound quality that Marshall engineered into these earbuds produces a rich full spine tingling jam that will put your listening experience right there as if listening to the studio final edit before the album hits the streets. The highs lows and midones are all equally produced with awesome quality and clarity. The earbuds themself scream quality just from looking at them then touching and then using. They are made of a mixture of aluminum and brass with some plastic components. The part that hangs down from the ear seems to be knurled aluminum that helps you hold onto them when putting them in or removing them. The case has a grippy exterior and holds some battery power to recharge the buds without an additional power source. And that case can be charged on a wireless charger or with an outside power source and a USB C cable. A cable is not provided but they are not very expensive if you dont happen to have one already. Personally, I have several. Quality appearance and sound quality made by Marshall are something you can be proud to own!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall, synonymous with supreme sound quality and iconic design, has blessed the audio world with the Marshall Motif II True Wireless Earbuds. They flawlessly encapsulate all the characteristic features that distinguish Marshall products and bring along a plethora of smart, modern tech features, delivering an unparalleled auditory experience. Design: The Motif II embodies Marshall’s classic aesthetic with matte black knurled metal and coarse leather accents. The subtle nod to the guitar plug with the gold tip on the earbuds is a delightful touch for music aficionados. The build is primarily comprised of 70% recycled plastic, blending sustainability with iconic aesthetics. Sound Quality: The sound signature is rich and immersive, producing crystal clear audio, crispy highs, smooth mids, and deep lows. The customizable EQ settings available via the Marshall Bluetooth app are a treat for audiophiles, allowing a seamless switch between the signature Marshall sounds or tailor-made EQs. The Deep Bass and Marshall Signature Sound settings are particularly impressive, providing a robust and authentic listening experience and are currently my go-to sound settings. User Experience: The Marshall app’s integration makes a significant difference, enabling users to harness the full potential of these earbuds. The Active Noise Cancelling and Transparency mode are impeccable, offering serene isolation and, when needed, seamless blending with the surroundings. The user interface is user-friendly, allowing even the most non-tech-savvy users to navigate through various settings easily. The app lets you customize the touch buttons on the earbuds making the experience more personal and easier to navigate.

Whether you are an audiophile with a discerning ear or a casual listener who values aesthetics and quality, the Marshall Motif II will not disappoint. The commitment to eco-conscious materials and the incredible audio output make this a worthy investment for those seeking the epitome of sound excellence in a compact, wireless form."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Two years ago Marshall introduced their great Motif Active Noise Cancelling earbuds which brought the classic Marshall sound to active outdoor enthusiasts. Now they have brought an improved version, the Motif II, to the stage and it is a rock star! Better battery life, better noise reduction, richer sound! Founded in 1963, Marshall Amplification has become the best known designer and manufacturer of professional music amplifiers and stage speakers. Its classic “Marshall” script on the grill cloth is a guarantee that the equipment is top quality and will produce, as Pete Townshend noted, “sizzling sound with crunch!” Since 2010 Marshall has worked closely with Sweden’s top-rated Zound Industries to create consumer versions of its audio equipment. This review will focus on the latest of these collaborations, the Marshall Motif II ANC wireless Bluetooth earphones. They are priced a bit lower than AirPods but I believe offer better features: • Marshall Motif II ANC Bluetooth true wireless earbuds (Model 1006450) • 6 mm dynamic drivers, 16 ohm impedance • Frequency response range: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz • Excellent driver sensitivity: 108 (+/- 2) dB @ 1 mW, 1 KHz • Bluetooth 5.3 LE connectivity, 30+ foot range, Codecs: SBC, AAC, LC3 • Active Noise Cancellation with Transparency mode • Two integrated microphones in each earbud for phone calls and ANC cancellation • IPX5 water resistance (safe against low pressure water stream), IPX4 in case • Multi-function touch controls (play, pause, skip/back track, accept/end phone call, ANC setting, equalizer selection, Spotify TAP, volume) on each earbud • Lithium polymer battery life: 6 hours playtime with ANC, 9 hours with ANC off, 30 hours total with in-case recharging (with ANC), 43 hours total with in-case recharging (ANC off) • 1.5 hour recharge time from full discharge; 15 minute recharge provides 1 hour playtime • Charging: Wireless (Qi pad required, not included) or with included USB-C cable • Hard shell carrying case which recharges earbuds and initiates Bluetooth pairing • 8” USB-C 5V-12V recharge cable included • Three silicone ear tip sizes (small, medium, large) included • Weight: 4.31 gram (earbuds), 55.7 gram (in charging case) • One year warranty on parts and labor Download the Marshall Bluetooth app to provide a full user guide, equalizer settings, ANC sensitivity, touch controls, charge status and other additional features. Everything is extremely well made and the earbuds have a special coating to protect them from scratches and moisture. The thicker curled black knobs and Marshall “M” script really look good. The bottom of the earbud knob is now an attractive polished gold with a pattern like the knobs on those big Marshall stage amps – a very slick touch! The charging/carry case is covered in black alligator tolex (the same material used on their amps.) First step is to charge the ear buds in the clam shell charging case. Just place the case on a Qi pad or attach the USB-C charging cable and LED lights will tell you when they are fully charged. The case itself serves as a supplemental battery, holding four full additional charges even when disconnected from power. Pop the earbuds back into the case for 15 minutes and you have another hour of charge. Leave them in for an hour and they are fully charged again. You can do that three or four times before the case itself needs recharging. I tested the claimed battery life – 6 hours when using ANC, 9 hours with ANC off and can confirm that it is accurate. Frankly, I rarely use the ANC feature on any headphone because it always seems to detract from full and accurate music reproduction, but it does work well on these earbuds when switched on. The Marshall Motif II ANC earbuds are truly wireless and fit very securely in the ear, thanks to their somewhat boxy oblong shape which conforms well to the ear’s interior. Try the three supplied rubber ear tips to select the one which feels most comfortable for long sessions. For me the small tip gave the best fit and enabled me to get the best sound quality. The Bluetooth connection just requires pressing a button on the charging/carrying case for a few seconds. The new 5.3 LE Bluetooth specification provided a solid connection up to 50 feet from my phone and was very stable in all conditions. Sound quality is superb, very clear, distortion-free with excellent midrange and highs. And the bass is very good – just what you would expect from Marshall. The Marshall Bluetooth app includes an equalizer with five pre-set sound profiles (Bass Boost, Mid Boost, Treble Boost, Mid Reduction and “Marshall”) and one sound profile that you can customize. I found that the various options matched well to the various music genres in my extensive library. Naturally, the Marshall setting was best for hard rock! I am a fairly serious runner and biker and have always been annoyed by the wires connecting my earphones to my iPhone so having an earbud that would stay in my ear under all conditions is essential. I considered AirPods but some friends who used them said that they can fall out if you sweat a lot during your workout, and frankly, I think they look a little weird. Fortunately, the Marshall Motif II has both great aesthetics and superb ergonomics – a very nice solution to the problem. You choose earbuds for outside activities – will they stay in? Yes!!! I took them for a long (three hour) run and never had a problem even as I worked up a good sweat in 80+ degree weather. But running is probably not the biggest test. Can you rely upon the fit while biking? The next day I went for an all-day ride over some rough roads and once again they performed perfectly. They never felt loose. I recharged them in the case after about 5 hours while I stopped for food but that was quick. The case is compact and unobtrusive in your pocket, but for most workouts you can rely upon the 6 hour playing time from each charge and leave the case at home. Other features? The earbuds have excellent touch controls (play, pause, skip/back track, accept/end phone calls, ANC setting, equalizer selection, Spotify TAP, volume) which work well. The ANC function has a Transparency setting which amplifies ambient sounds when desired (e.g., conversations in noisy settings). The earbuds are sealed and have an IPX5 rating so even a stream of water on them will not cause damage, so have no fear about using them in the rain. (Airpods are rated only IPX4.) The very light weight (4.3 gram) of the earbuds really enhances their comfort when wearing them for long periods. Drawbacks? The included owner’s manual is thick, so you think – great, lots of instructions and tips - but then you find it has only one page of information repeated in 36 languages! Fortunately, the app has all the information you need, so no worries. Bottom line? If you want to be transported back to the musical glories of the rock era but don’t want to give up any of the technologic comforts of today buy these outstanding earbuds. They have my highest and unqualified endorsement and you will crank up your personal cool quotient to 11.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall Motif II A.N.C. – True Wireless, Active Noise Cancelling In-Ear Headphones are Fantastic! For over one year, my favorite earbuds have been my Marshall Motif A.N.C. first generation. The new Motif II, second generation earbuds provide several improvements. Selecting earbuds / in-ear monitors is a very personal matter. There are several important criteria that I base my evaluation and selection of earbuds on. • Fit and comfort. A good fit and wearing comfort over hours of continuous use is essential, and in my estimation one of the most important selection criteria. • Technical Specifications. The specifications provide a basis for assessing the potential performance capabilities of the earbuds. • Features and Functionality. Some features are relatively ubiquitous among many earbuds, but certain features or functions which may be very important to a particular user may not be available on all earbuds. • Battery Performance. Battery life and fast recharging capability are extremely important factors for wireless headphones. • Audio Reproduction Quality and Fidelity. Audio quality is the critical evaluation criterion so long as the earbuds have met the criterion of being comfortable to wear. The sound reproduction performance is the most critical factor for the best listening experience. The Marshall Motif II earbuds are equipped with a compact and attractive storage and charging case weighing only about 56 grams with the earbuds or about 47 grams empty. The Marshall logo branded case is approximately 2 ½” x 1 ¾”, has rounded edges and a textured guitar amp covering resembling Tolex. A USB-C port on the bottom is used with the supplied 6” USB-C to USB-A charging cable. The case also supports wireless charging. A pairing mode button is located on the front of the case, above which is an LED charging indicator lamp which progresses from the red indication of discharge through yellow and finally green which indicates a completed charge. The LED pulses blue during Bluetooth pairing. The earbuds are retained in the case magnetically, and molded contours ensure that the charging contacts properly align. Upon the first opening of the case, the new earbuds enter Pairing Mode. Since I already use the Marshall Bluetooth app on my Android smartphone, the pairing operation was quickly completed. I did encounter some issues with the Marshall app properly loading and communicating with the new earbuds, which took some persistence to resolve. These problems occurred on one of my phones but not the other. I strongly suspect that the problem is associated with the particular build of Android 13 on that particular phone model. One of the improvements for the Motif II earbuds is the ability to retain a maximum of 8 paired devices (increased from 3), and the extremely important capability of being actively connected to two source devices simultaneously. Through this change, Marshall addressed one of the few shortcomings of the prior generation. It is important to me to be able to simultaneously stream audio from my laptop, and also be able to answer or place phone calls. The automatic arbitration and switching between connected source devices works perfectly! This represents a great improvement over the original earbuds. The Marshall app provides an efficient, user-friendly control interface for the new Motif II earbuds as well as the original Motif earbuds. All Marshall headphone models are supported using the Marshall app, and it is easy to switch between the paired headphones in the app. The app displays the percentage of charge level of each earbud and the charging case. There are six, 5-band, equalizer settings available for the Motif II. Marshall has added a “Custom” (user defined) 5-band equalizer selection for the Motif II, which is still not available for the first generation Motif. The app stores only 2 EQ presets in the selection rotation for the Motif II, compared to 3 for the Gen 1 Motif. I genuinely miss the additional slot and believe that it should be added to the Motif II. Preset #1 is the “Marshall” setting and cannot be modified. Preset #2 allows assignment of any one of the 6 presets. The preset selections include, Marshall, Bass Boost, Mid Boost, Treble Boost, Mid Reduction and Custom for the Motif II, while the original Motif has presets named Marshall, Rock, Spoken, Pop, Hip-Hop and Electronic. I believe that it would be far better if the Motif Gen I EQ presets were also available to the Motif II. Curiously, none of the Motif II presets share the same (or even similar) frequency contours as the Motif I presets. I actually prefer the Rock and Pop presets which are only available for the original Motif earbuds. Although it is great to finally have a user defined, custom equalizer option, the equalizer frequency bands have no visual indicators of the number of dB of cut or boost. There are no scale lines on the bands, nor is there any digital indicator. It would obviously be beneficial if the EQ frequency bands for all of the EQ settings displayed a numeric scale representing dB levels of gain boost or attenuation. I would like to replicate the EQ settings of my favorite Gen I presets, but that is virtually impossible without any dB reference points. The Marshall app permits assigning the function to be controlled by the capacitive touch buttons on each earbud. They can be the same or different. Noise Control levels are adjustable, and ANC may also be deactivated. The Automatic Noise Control (ANC) works well, however it also materially alters the gain on certain frequencies. There is also a Transparency setting which provides the ability to hear some ambient sounds and conduct a conversation, without removing the earbuds. Among the other app settings is Battery Preservation which can be set to limit the maximum charge level to 90%, charge only room temperature batteries or reduce the rate of charge (turn off rapid charging) thereby extending the longevity of the Li-ion battery cells. The earbuds are compact and lightweight, at less than 4.5 grams, which are both important attributes. I like that the body of the earbud is largely confined to the ear, rather than having a large, bulbous housing protruding from each ear, which affects the stability and balance of the earbuds while being worn, and resultantly may adversely affect the air-seal between the eartips and the user’s ear. I also found that the shape and size of the Motif II earbuds generally conformed well to the anatomy of my ears. This contributed to both my wearing comfort as well as to the exceptional audio quality. The earbuds have a cylindrical battery and microphone projection on the housings. That cylinder is cut with fine texture diamond knurls. The air-seal as well as the directional orientation of the transducer to the ear canal greatly affect the characteristics of the audio heard by the user. A good air-seal is essential to hearing high fidelity audio, and most notably low frequency bass. Making minor adjustments to the rotational orientation of the earbud can aim the driver optimally and significantly affect the audio quality. The Marshall Motif II is supplied with 3 sets of soft, pliable silicone eartips. Sizes Small and Large are packed in the box, and the Medium eartips are preinstalled. I found the medium eartips to be best for both comfort and ensuring a solid air-seal in the ears. The Automatic Noise Cancellation performance of the Motif II earbuds is excellent. Noise Cancellation is easily put to the test by wearing them proximate to a loud fan or air conditioner, or running water. The fan or A/C noise evaluation also incorporates the movement of large volumes of air in combination with the noise produced by the fan. While the Motif II will not completely eliminate all background noise in that extreme test, it very effectively mitigated the noise. The Transparency mode also works reasonably well. The Motif II uses a pair of integral microphones to monitor ambient sound and optimize ANC and Transparency modes. The specifications for the Marshall Motif II earbuds are very good. The 6mm, 16Ώ driver has a rated sensitivity of 108 dB, and a frequency range of 20-20,000 Hz, which is relatively common among headphones. The earbuds are IPX5 rated and the case is IPX4 rated demonstrating resistance to minor splashes and sprays of water. The Bluetooth 5.3 LE is rated for 30’, but I exceeded that distance before experiencing a drop-out. Marshall claims battery performance of 6 hours with ANC and 9 hours without, and 30 total hours in-case with ANC and 43 hours without. A Quick Charge of 15 minutes yields 1 hour of use. Fully recharging the Motif II requires 1.5 hours for the earbuds and 1.5 hours for the case. The new battery life and rapid charging specifications are a significant improvement on the original Motif earbuds. The Motif II earbuds provide 10 hours of additional play with ANC and 17 hours without ANC as compared to the original Motif earbuds. I really appreciate the extra usable time before needing to recharge the earbuds. The Marshall Motif II earbuds are very comfortable, balanced, stable and secure in the ears, and an all-important air-seal is easily achieved and maintained, even while engaging in physical activity. The audio quality of the Marshall Motif II earbuds is exceptional! Listening to a variety of high fidelity sources for lengthy, continuous periods while employing various EQ settings resulted in me being extremely favorably impressed! Telephone calls were likewise exceptional, with optimal clarity on both ends of the conversation. The ANC proved to be extremely competent in background noise reduction. The Marshall Motif II A.N.C. earbuds are outstanding, and are my new favorite earbuds based on both wearing comfort and exceptional high fidelity audio reproduction.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The earbuds are what i expect from marshall. I had the previous model which did not have the rubber tip earbuds or the noise cancellation. The storage case/power bank looks the same as the previous version and has 30hrs of juice for multiple charging sessions. It has a dressy look to them and i appreciate the textured design to hide away scratches and blemishes. The earbuds themselves have the same black color scheme with gold accents. The rubber tip makes them more comfortable than their previous version. The textured earbud stem has a unique look and the M imprint adds a bit of style. The connection is simple, the auto connect once paired to your device. The auto pause feature is very convenient as to avoid missing any any audio i the bud falls out or if you remove them for whatever reason...no more fumbling for your phone to pause the video/music. The Marshall App allows for sound customization and it is pretty straight forward. The sound is very full and robust, not quite headbanger bass but a very full rich sound. The noise cancellation does a good job of cancelling out loud exterior sound when combined with the right size earbuds to make a good seal with your ear canal. It also allows touch activation for allowing sound thru if needed, quick conversation and then back to the jams. The sound, tech and design is all above average...I would very highly recommend them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have always loved Marshall products, but for musical instruments. I was hesitant to think Marshall could make earbuds that rival some of the leaders in the industry. I was happy to find out they hit a home run. First off, the packaging is top notch and very impressive. Includes everything you need to get going. Ear tips are included in different sizes for a custom fit. I love that this is USB-C. A short cable is included for charging. The case is well made and designed. Very rugged and sturdy. It has a slight grip to it which I love so it won’t slip out of your hands. The ear buds themselves say quality. You can feel the attention to detail when you hold them. They feel great and look excellent. They charged quickly. After pairing them with my phone, I was directed to download the Marshall App. Within minutes I was listening to my favorite tunes and they sounded great. The Marshall App has many features but my favorite is the equalizer. You can choose one of their presets or customize your own. The sound is bold and clear. The ANC is superior. It is on par with other top tier brands. I felt the sound was excellent and precise. The ear buds are comfortable and I experienced zero discomfort after hours of listening to music and radio. Up to 30 hours of total time with the rechargeable case. Overall I am very impressed with these earbuds. Marshall really came through and designed an excellent set of earbuds. Highly recommended.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have used the Marshall - Motif II ANC - Black earbuds for just over a week. My level of expectation was very high. My first impressions were low. My disappointment quickly changed. The software on my iPhone was updated the same day, which changed some sound settings which I fixed, as well as I needed to download the Marshall App. Once done, the Motif II ANC FAR EXCEEDED my expectations. The music experience (yes…experience and emersion into the music are among the best I’ve ever had, especially in an earbud!), the call clarity and noise cancellation are great, as is the battery life (with wireless charging and USB-C connectivity). TL;DR: 1. I used them over a week with an iPhone 13 Pro 2. SETUP was quick after downloading the Marshall App 3. CALLS and ANC are excellent 4. MUSIC sounds amazing (the Marshall history comes to life through your earbuds) 5. HARDWARE is very nice (the embossed vegan leather is topnotch) 6. TRANSPORT/CARRY is easy (nearly identical to AirPods Pro 1/2 The Marshall App (there are 3 Tabs): Tab 1 It helps you pair, set up and customize your earbuds with your devices(s) * Noise Control - works very well (and as * Active Notice Control (ANC) * Low, Medium and High * Fully off * Transparency Mode * Low, Medium and High * Equalizer * The Original Marshall Sound * Custom * Bass Boost * Mid Boost * Treble Boost * Mid Reduction (my overall favorite) You can also customize touch controls on each earbud (although there isn’t a function for volume control, which will hopefully be in a future update). If you use Spotify, Spotify Tap is available and a great feature. It would be nice to see that integrated into other music apps, too. There is also a battery preservation mode, which will maintain the life of your earbuds and case. Tab 2 Basically an inventory of the devices Marshall currently manufactures Tab 3 Basically the “legal stuff”', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall’s reputation is well known for high quality audio for years. These noise cancelling ear buds look amazing with their leather look case and sleek design. Initial setup was a breeze. I must say that many ear buds that I have tried don’t always get discovered and paired easily but these are the exception. I am not an fruit guy, I have always had the Android leader as my phone. As soon as I popped open the case, my phone saw then and prompted for a quick and easy setup. I found them very comfortable with the existing ear tips, but they do come with several sizes that you can easily change out. Sound quality, this is where Marshall’s excel. I honestly think the purity of the sound of these exceeds many higher end over the ear headphones. That’s a big statement but the stereo separation on these is amazing, they truly give an expansive sound. J ust go listen to “Fly me to the Moon” from Frank Sinatra and WOW, you will see what I am saying. It’s like being there in person. Now, to be honest, the ANC when first put on with no music is not the greatest. It’s just above average but once you start playing your music, any outside noise disappears completely. Bottom line, they do the job and do it well, especially when playing. Just listen to “Baby I love your Way” from Peter Frampton Live. Yeah, you will see. After that, slip into a bit of “Do you feel like we Do (Live)”. Turn them up on some of the solo guitar riffs and you will see what I mean. You will be sold on these! I would highly recommend these as setup was probably the easiest of any recent earbuds that I have tried. I have yet to try these as phone ear buds but if the experience is as good or better than my music experience, then wow…Great investment.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I tend to have problems with ear buds, as they all fall out of my ears. So to my surprise, when I first put these in they actually stayed in! They come with a few different size tips, which many others do too, but these actually stay in. Besides them staying in, they are also comfortable and a nice small size so they are comfortable to use. The case is also nice as its small and feels well built, so I won’t worry about dropping it and scratching it. For me I’ve been using the apple air pods with an iPhone so a lot of my comparison goes to that. If you’re using android or other earphones you might like these even more. Overall though I think they are very comparable and a good alternative to the apple ones. I like that you can use a USB-c or a wireless charger to get the case charged and then the headphones charged, and when you put them into the case they turn off and charge. I did download the app and set them up, and its pretty easy to flip the ANC or pass through in the app, though if you are on iPhone using apple product they build it into the system so it might be a little easier there. From the sound perspective, these sound great. I like the built in equalizer that you get in the app and is already setup for you although if you want you can do it yourself too. And I used them on a few calls and they have a decent mic. The ANC noise canceling was ok, but nothing super good. I had them on and turned on and could hear someone talking to me in the same room, but considering these are earbuds it wasn’t too bad. Overall I would recommend these as they are small and fit in your pocket in the case, and actually stay in at least my ear.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Marshall is a brand I\'ve been familiar with since very young. Relatives of mine who as guitar enthusiasts had Marshall amps, would only use Marshall, and the rich, warm sound is something I will never forget. I was very interested in listening to these buds, as I\'ve had a little experience with Marshall\'s more recent bluetooth speakers and consider them solid contenders in that market for a complete sound signature and enjoyable dynamic. I wasn\'t surprised then that I found the same balanced, ""sound where you expect it"" tonality and fullness in these buds. The lower frequencies, particularly the low and mid bass, are definitely present and controlled but also punchy enough that you don\'t feel lack on electronic and hip hop tracks, and the treble highs are very present as well, so podcasts and spoken word also come through strong. I would say the mid range is probably lacking for me, subjectively speaking. The two ends just come through much stronger. That is however not a huge problem as the app for these buds do have a custom eq function and you can do some tweaking. Listening to Marshall\'s signature tuning gives me what I described above, but when I customize to a V shape, it somehow actually enhanced the mid range for me to my liking. I know, weird. But the great thing is that if you are considering these buds, you have a considerable amount of flexibility here. The controls on the buds are pretty standard, and the app gives you a couple of options to adjust this. The standard gives you play/pause, skips, and a custom action that you can assign things like noise control and assistant. There is also a ""mini"" setting that takes out the skips, so you can have it pretty stripped down if you want. These buds also use the Spotify tap function if you are a Spotify user, and I\'ve been seeing this more and more on buds, so that\'s nice to have. I tried these on both iOS and Android devices and the buds do have the Google quick pairing feature, so it was seamless on both platforms. Form is pretty premium. The case has that signature texturized surface that Marshall is known for, it has a leather feel, although I\'m not sure it\'s real leather or not. The buds themselves are plastic housing, but the stems are metal and knurled, again something I associate with Marshall. I found these to feel a little weird on my ears, and I would say make them not as comfy as other buds for me. The noise control functions as you would expect, ANC and transparency are both there. The ANC is pretty weak for me. The medium tips came installed, I tried those, with disappointing isolation. So I upped it to the large tips and that improved it a bit, but playing music and TV noise in the background, I could easily make out what was playing. The transparency mode is decent, but it doesn\'t stand up to the best transparency buds I\'ve evaluated at this point. Just ok. Overall, the noise control and fit in my ears are why I give these 4 stars. I find the sound pleasing and easily customizable to my liking. The controls are intuitive although touch based rather than squeeze based which I find overall slightly better. For the price, I would say if you are an iOS user, these aren\'t compelling enough than the native platform options because the sound is very comparable and you get extras features with those for around the same price, but for Android platforms these have a sound that rivals some of the best buds out there at this price and even higher.']"

Refurbished (Good) - JBL Live 660NC Wireless Over-Ear Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones - Blue,$111.98,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/refurbished-good-jbl-live-660nc-wireless-over-ear-noise-cancelling-bluetooth-headphones-blue/16982731/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After using these headphones for now quite some time, they are fantastic. The best parts about them is how durable and strongly built they are, in addition to being also lightweight. They really seem to quite handle any sort of situation. They also fold up and the ear cups do twist, making them super portable. I have used the headphones on a flight and they were perfect for the airport, on and off the plane, and simple connectivity to my phone. The noise cancelling is one of the most impressive things about the JBL Tune 660\'s! They took out the outside sound with no problems. I couldn\'t even hear people talking, and I hardly heard the typical airplane engine sound. In my opinion, they match almost equal to over ear style headphones noise cancellation (I have JBL E65btnc for reference). That\'s super impressive for on ear style headphones! That really took me for surprise! As for button controls are basic for what they are. Volume up, down, play, pause all worked fine with my phone. (I just find it easier to use my phone to adjust play/pause volume up/down.) As for sound quality, they are great, but not amazing. The Bass is definitely there. Mid\'s, Hi\'s Low\'s are pretty clear. I do think a lot of sound does go missing since they\'re on ear and not over ear. So you\'re kind of missing that ""3D surround sound"" that you\'ll get from over ear. To sum it up, for middle class style headphones they\'re great! If you\'re a type of person who\'s very on the move, and while in a car, train, plane, etc. wants to jam up some nice sounding music, then these are the right headphones for you. If you\'re more of a Sound guy or studio who cares a lot about the sound quality, go with the over ear to get the full experience. Highly recommended for the average buyer!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Trust my review I am very picky when it comes to headphones. I definitely recommend these JBL Tune 660NC. These on ear headphones will surprise you for the price. Here is my rating and a couple of feedback for each category for them so that you know how they will work for you like they worked for me and my rating for them. I do have a full review below that though. Overall for Google Phones they connect fast, work hand in hand with the features of Google such as Voice Assistant and for me the active noise cancelling feature works awesome for me to where I don't have to take them off if I want to talk to someone or when I don't want to hear anything else around me when playing music or taking a call. >Fit 4/5 Covers my ears almost completely and a little snug though but with anyone with bigger ears will get that on ear headphone feel and fit. Can use it for active use such as in the Gym for like walking, running and weightlifting but would not recommend for crossfit or high intensity workouts when I tried it they would slip off or would not stay on. No upside down either. >Connectivity/Use 5/5 Paired fast with Google Pair and worked seamlessly with music, phone calls and voice assistant app Google Assistant >Battery 5/5 Have not had to charge it yet and its been 5 days! Sound 4/5 Clear crisp JBL sound I love. Could be a little louder though. Used it with different genres so you can def hear the individual highs, mid and lows. Can use your equalizer in your app to adjust it Also people around you cannot hear you turn it up so great to use on airplane and library. >Noise Cancelling Feature 4/5 Only cancels completely when playing music which that what JBL means by Active Noise Cancelling. But love it cause I don't have to take them off when having a conversation with people. Cancels Noise when I need them too. Only 4 because if someone is looking for noise cancelling completely you wont get that with these. Full Review Below!! Fit: They fit really well and are really comfortable. They seem built pretty sturdy. They sit on my ear pretty well. For everyday use they are comfortable and even work well while wearing glasses and a football hat. For active use they work well with sweat and your normal cardio like running and weightlifting. I wouldn't recommend them for like crossfit though cause for too much movement they kind of slip off. Connectivity: So I used my Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus for this test. When opening them out of the box my google used Google Fast Pair and automatically detected them and connected them without me having to go to settings which was pretty cool so if you do not know how to connect headphones that will eliminate stress. Did not lose connection with them. From being upstairs with them and forgot to leave my phone downstairs I was able to take a phone call and listen to music without interruption. Taking phone calls was pretty easy. The buttons on the headphones even let you mute, accept and even hang up on your calls. You can even use Google Assistant with and any other voice apps such as siri with apple phones and bixby with Samsung. With music can pause a song, go to previous and next song and of course adjust volume. Battery: Opened it up since last saturday and since a full charge has been a week of being off and on them and have not had to charge them and battery is only at 50%. So I would say the battery is definitely impressive. They do pretty well conserving battery they turn off after a while of not being used which never had that before with previous bluetooth headphones. Sound: The sound of the headphones were pretty clear and crisp and was even able to use the equalizer of my amazon music player to adjust it to different pre sets which really allowed me to watch the headphones adjust to jazz to rock to pop and really experience the headphones true range which they did not disappoint. I can turn them all the way up and people around me don't hear them so its great if you want to jam and not worry about disturbing anybody so feel free to turn them up in a library or airplane! lol Noise Cancelling Feature: So I gave them a 4/5 cause the Noise cancelling does not completely cancel the noise, I can still talk to someone with them on except they sound muffled whenever I am not playing music. Now when I play music I definitely cannot hear anyone or anything. I think that's where the active part of noise cancelling comes in they activate whenever you are playing music or on a phone call which I think is a really helpful feature to use most noise cancelling headphones you have to take off if you want to have a conversation with someone especially when working out in the gym but with these you will not have that problem."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these headphones earlier this year since I needed a comfortable pair for regular use. I came across these with nice padding on ear and extra cushion in the headband. I love using these while cooking and cleaning around the house. With the noise canceling I can just turn on my music, get in my zone, and tune out the chaos around me. My teen son also likes to use these when we go on longer road trips so he can ignore his younger sibling and whatever the rest of the family is listening to in the car. I'll be purchasing another pair for him on his birthday or Christmas."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great overall headphones. They’re lightweight, comfortable, and have great sound quality. I’m definitely satisfied with these. First, in the area of comfort, it’s important to note that these are on-the-ear headphones, not over-the-ear headphones. If that’s an issue for you please just make sure you are aware. That being said, they are quite comfortable in my experience using them. They feel lightweight and stay secure without applying too much pressure on my ears. So wearing for a period of time won’t be bothersome. Much of this is based on personal preference though. And just as important as comfort is sound quality. The sound quality is great. You can hear highs and lows well, they have great bass, plenty of volume, and the clarity is excellent. These are great for music, podcasts, or whatever you want to listen to. The noise cancelling works well in the situations I’ve tried it in, such as with a space heater running next to me and in a busy room with an active family around me. I’m not traveling much these days, so there’s no way for me to try them in a plane or any really noisy environments like that. I expect they would work well though and give the noise cancelling you would need to comfortably listen to music or just to drown out the annoyance of plane noise. The connection was easy once I figured out what I was doing. The instructions advertised an automatic connection, but that didn’t pop up until after I had manually connected. Then it tied the headphones to my Google account which is supposed to help in the future. I also tried connecting to the JBL Headphones app to figure out what that would add to the experience, but that part didn’t work for some reason. It’s not necessary really, as the bluetooth connection on it’s own is easy enough and gets the job done well. The connection is strong, it didn’t drop off and it stayed connected as I walked away from my phone and sound quality stayed great. The build quality of these headphones is great. They’re amazingly sturdy despite how lightweight they are. There is nothing cheap about these things at all. I wouldn’t want to go throwing them in the bottom of a backpack or gym back without a case, but if you don’t mistreat them they should last for years. So in conclusion, the sound quality is great, the headphones are lightweight, and they are sturdy as anything. I highly recommend these headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound quality is always great with JBL headphones. I have a few pairs for professional audio work and this set is just as good. I like that it includes a wired port and cable to use when you don’t want bluetooth connectivity. It’s easy to pair with my computer and iPad. Switching between them is easy. The fit is lightweight easy on the ears. A good buy in my opinion.', ""I was surprised by the compliance of the noise cancellation function that I didn't expect much because it was on ear headphones, and the sound quality, volume, and Sound space are excellent. And the fit was comfortable without any inconvenience even after long use. I think it's better than my JBL 760NC."", ""Been testing the JBL Tune 660NC for approx. 14 days. Been using them while running and watching video/TV on the phone and Ipad on travel. When running they fit nicely and are stable. Not moving around sliding out of position. This is a huge benefit. They feel light to wear and the sound is great and they work perfectly for this purpose. I been running 3-4 times a week, for ~1 hour each time. Have not charged them since I got them. So the battery capacity is great. When using them while streaming on a mobile unit the active noise cancelling is very good. It takes out the surroundings great. I'm only disappointed the model is not supported by the JBL Audio app, since I also have some earplugs from JBL. And they should have included this model to that app as well. All over. Very happy with this product."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve had these for a couple weeks now.

The sound is great and most noise cancelling are less than expected. JBL Tune 660NC does the job very well. I wear them while baking to listen to podcasts and not to disturb whatever my husband may be watching. I can barely hear the mixer so I don’t miss a word of the podcast. Love this product. One issue, although not JBL’s issue, is that I’m very petite so they tend to slip down sometimes. I wish I could tighten them a bit more. I’m not an average or even small size, these would be perfect in that category. I’m just unusually petite. Thank you JBL, in spite of this personal issue they fit better than any others I have tried.']"

I had received my first ever pair of super cheap-o wireless earbuds a year or so ago, but although they broke after a few months, I did like wireless, so set out to find a well-reviewed but budget-friendly earbuds. I wanted a pair with the ear hooks, so I\'d not have to worry about them falling out. My wife was with me when I opened the box, and she wanted to try them on. The first thing she said when putting them in was ""Ooh, I like these and I want a pair for my birthday!"" So now I know what I\'m going to get her. I downloaded the app, and ran through the Hearing Test. It also had a fitment test, and suggested I try the larger ear tips. The app also had a Breathing Exercise, which I suppose was lost on me. But the app gives a great deal of control over the buds. They\'re _very_ comfortable. I like that the hooks are adjustable. In my ears I almost couldn\'t tell they were in. I like the physical buttons. I think the sound quality is terrific. The app allows you to adjust to your taste. I like the earbuds, and I\'ll be getting another set for my wife for her birthday.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound quality is great and very soft to use. Ear hooks is very flexible. Charge is long lasting.', ""Happy with them so far, they improved the sound quality for sure. I used the x10 for biking and it was great but getting the x20 wow I can still hear what's going on around me and enjoy my music 🎶 The pairing is supper fast and easy as soon as you pull them out it pairs. Only complaint I have so far is the ear adjuster doesn't go small enough to fit my ear, still stays in really good but was hoping to have it sit on my ears better."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The over-ear hooks keep the earbuds in during strenuous tasks and activities, like mowing, cycling, running, and more. I have not had any issues with the battery running low during a day of activity or connectivity issues with this device and my other devices.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Absolutely love these headphones. The sounds is great (quality and loudness) and they are so comfortable. I didn't have to replace the tips for them to fit well, but it comes with many to try on.

So far, would definitely recommend these."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These work fantastic. Great sound and plenty of bass. Bought the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2's and these are way better. I also have the AirPods Pro 2's which have great noise cancellation but for the cost buy these you won't be disappointed. AirPods Pro 2 for noise cancellation, yes. For sound, get the Soundcore."", ""These earbuds, DO NOT cancel our noise! In the gym I hear the music, people talking and the weight slamming noise. I reached out to Soundcore customer service and they were no help. Don't waste your money and go with something with a better ANC."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Amazing earbuds. Best I've owned. Choice of noise of cancellation or situational awareness options are great . Sound quality is very good. IP68 waterproof is awesome for long cardio workouts. Souncore brand recommended."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sound quality is great with noise cancellation mode activated.

You bet. This is the perfect ear buds for the Asus ROG Ally. Matching design just feels oh so right. It does kind of suck that it doesn't seem to pair with anything else other than the ROG Ally. I haven't really tried to much, but was in a situation where I left my over ear head phone I would wear for watching TV Shows / Movies on my Samsung Tablet, so I wanted to use these earbuds, but they would not seem to pair with my old Samsung Galaxy Tab S5, but it is able to connect to my Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 with a download of the Armory Crate from the Google Play store."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like these earbuds. They produce decent sound. Noise cancelling is okay and has pretty good ambient sound feature. The problem I have with it is the case. I absolutely hate it! While the design looks distinctively unique, it also feels absurdly cheap and hollow. Opening the case almost always requires a 2nd attempt as it is just so weirdly shaped. Texture makes it even more difficult. Ive owned several buds and never had any of their case slip through my hands. Its like trying to handle a drenching bar of used soap thats been soaked in lube. Plugging in a USB C cable feels awkward because of, again, its odd shape. The charging tip doesnt fit nicely with the port, subpar penetration.

I recommend going for the Void series headset from Corsair if you're dead set on using this brand as this was meant to replace the one i had brake on me after 5 to 6 years of use and no issues coming from my Void Pro wireless.

I can even keep Bluetooth paired to my phone, and it will automatically switch from USB to Bluetooth when I receive phone calls. It sounds great and fits comfortably.

Why they need to rotate 90 degrees, I have no idea, but its not well designed and horrible quality. Don't buy this product. Not worth the money.

JVC HA-A10T-P Completely Wireless In-Ear Bluetooth Headset With Microphone and Remote Pink,$43.65,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-ha-a10t-p-completely-wireless-in-ear-bluetooth-headset-with-microphone-and-remote-pink/14180167/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] BUILD QUALITY: It comes in a medium to large sized quality plastic case which is used to store the earphones along with charge them. It has a magnetic clasp to keep the lid closed which feels solid to open and close. The earbuds themselves are held it place with magnets which I did not expect at this price point. This makes it very easy to place them in the case and remove them. On the front of the case it shows a battery indicator, so you know how much charge you have left (see pictures). The earbuds hold a 4-hour charge with another 10-hours included in the case for a total of 14-hours. The case itself along with the earbuds charge slower than their more expensive counterparts. The earbuds themselves are medium to large in size. They are surrounded in glossy black plastic except for the outer part which is a matte black. There is a small button on each which is very stiff but solid. It does not shake. A small LED is located beside it which constantly blinks red when they aren’t paired, white/red when trying to pair, or white when paired. I find this to be a negative as it can be distracting for those around you or if you are in a dark room. I would prefer that it blink when I first turn them on but once they are connected the lights turn off which the more expensive models do. They are relatively comfortable. But it takes some playing around with the ear tips to make them fit right. The comfort themselves is about average. Which at this price point is to be expected. It does come with three different rubber ear tips and two memory foam ear tips. I went for the foam ear tips and the seal they made in my ear are incredible. To the point where the noise isolation they provide are better than any of my other earbuds, even those that include active noise isolation. EASE OF USE: As for the Bluetooth connection. It’s solid. The earbuds are easy to pair. Just turn on pairing mode, open Bluetooth in your phone and connect. Once you’ve connected they will reconnect quickly due to Bluetooth 5.0. I did have some drop outs, but it reconnected quickly and happened seldom. The left earbud is the master unit. Which means that it holds the Bluetooth connection to the device (cell phone, etc.). Then the right earbuds connect itself to the left earbud. You can use the left earbud independently without the right. You CANNOT use the right bud independently without the left from my testing. When you take out the left earbud it will say “connected.” If you then take out the right earbud it will make a jingle sound as will the left verifying they are connected to each other. Earlier on in truly wireless earbuds (especially those priced at this range) this is where they would fail most often is not connecting with each other. However, these connect with each other 10/10 times without any problems. Which is truly remarkable for this price point. The ease of use and them “just working” was refreshing. Gosh I love technology. Some other random things I haven’t mentioned yet. The earbuds also have some onboard controls. Due to the button being so firm and hard to depress I found the controls to work only some of the time. Likely due to user error on my part but I haven’t had problems with any other earbuds in that regard. They fit securely in the ear and won’t fall out when running or working out. They come with IPX4 rating which means they can easily handle sweat, rain, or accidental spills. SOUND QUALITY: Sound quality for these is excellent especially, for this price point as long as you can get a solid seal. Without a solid seal no earbuds will sound good. As I said earlier I had a tremendous seal on these which made them sound great. Yes, great. I was blown away at how good these sounded for the price point. They were balanced, with good bass (not overbearing, but not anemic either. Once again very dependent on the seal you have), crisp, with good detail, with a more forward and fun natural sound. Depth and imaging was meh. Soundstage was small. I didn’t hear any bloat, brightness, muddiness, congestion, or harshness. THIS OR MORE EXPENSIVE MODELS? What is the difference between these and more expensive models you might ask? None of the things listed below I would expect these to have at this price point. As the ones which do are usually at least $100 - $200 more expensive. The value for these for what you get is tremendous. - These do not come with a passthrough/ambient mode. Which uses microphones to allow you to hear what is going on around you with the earbuds in place. I don’t expect something priced in this range to have it. But this made me completely unaware of the sound around me which I don’t like as it could leave me open to threats when I am out and about. As I couldn’t hear anything with them in my ears. - No active noise isolation. Just excellent passive noise isolation (for me at least). - No auto pause when you take out an earbud. - No quick charge. - Cannot use just the left OR just the right. But instead just the left. Which honestly for this price point is impressive. - Doesn’t come with an app where you can control EQ settings or adjust what buttons do. CONCLUSION: I have almost no negatives for these. The ones I do have are limited and easily overlooked for the price. If you are looking at earbuds at all and are not wanting to break the bank these should be among the choices. As the bang for your buck is fantastic. They just work and come in a very good case. You’ll be hard pressed to find better for cheaper or around the same price. I have a feeling these will be hard to find in stock.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JVC headphones are really nice and compact. They have their own charging case and it\'s a nice size to keep with you on the go. The overall look of the headphones is really good and inconspicuous. I like how the headphone memory foam tip can conform to my ear canal shape. Fits well, and has a nice soft fit. When placed in securely I feel like it blocks out some of the outside noise even though it\'s not a noise cancelling headphone. The battery charging case is helpful to have for on the go charging when I\'m away from a power source. States that 4 hours of usage time is possible with these and I would guess that\'s pretty accurate as I was able to use these for extended periods of time while working in my home office. Syncing up to my iPhone XR was easy and fast right out of the box. Another thing I like is that when I pop the headphone up out of the charger case it connects automatically with my phone, with an instant power on. Phone calls are quiet and the audio is clear. When I speak the other listening party can hear me clearly and accurately. The push button on the headphones is fairly straight forward and easy to learn. Volume up and down. Skipping to the next song. Taking a call and hanging up. I believe these headphones are splash resistant but I haven\'t put them to the test besides a few sprinkles of rain. The sound quality is acceptable and I\'m pleased with it overall. I like the sound as it\'s crisp and good for everyday listening. I feel that for the value of these headphones and the sound quality they offer, along with true wireless capability it\'s a surefire winner. The portability and the sound are great. PRO: Size Sound quality CON: The built in audio message of ""power on"" is unappealing', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC HA-A10T truly wireless ear buds seem like an absolute steal for the price that they are selling them for. Don’t get me wrong, they are not feature rich and don’t offer touch controls or anything beyond a single button that on each ear bud that either pauses/resumes with a short press or FF (right) RW (left) with a long press. Other than that, you can’t control the volume from them and there is no voice assistant either. However, not everyone requires all those extra features, or they don’t want to spend a lot to get them. These are a great balance of looks, fitment, features, and sound quality. Sound quality is really good on these, and I was surprised. When I first put them on I was not impressed, so you might have to spend some time trying out the many different memory foam or gel pieces that you are presented with. Once I found the right pair, they fit snug and sounded great. Bass was deep and the trebles where high. They do fit deep in your ear canal and after a while I did find them to be less and less comfortable, so I might have to play around with the different ear gels some more. Battery life is rated at 4 hours and the charging case holds another 10 from what JVC claims. I have had similar real-world results with those numbers. The case top is secured with a magnetic clam shell top and the earpieces also held in place with magnets. It is a satisfying feeling and they do feel secure in there. Phone call quality was lacking on these, but not horrible. Pairing the devices was a breeze and the connection between them and my Galaxy Note 10+ does have an occasional choppiness that I haven’t experienced with my other headsets, however, that initial choppiness goes away after a few seconds and does not seem to come back. Over-all, for the money, you cannot go wrong with these and they might be the perfect ear buds for someone to get to do a trial run to see if they are prone to loosing something this small.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good sound quality. But not going beat the high priced wireless ear buds. Easy to pair up with any device. Tried my cell phone, tablet, and laptop. Easy to use. Comfortable for medium use.

Battery life about 3 hours with constant use with volume level about medium. Overall good quality', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The search for perfection in a product is a game that\'s rarely won. There are too many variables, particularly when you\'re talking about audio equipment. I own 5, maybe more (not sure where they all are!) sets of headphones. All in that search for perfection of sound and comfort. The JVC HA A10T clearly states the design intent is to ""fit comfortably in your ears"". They nailed it. They come with several different sizes and shapes of memory foam tips to match your ear shape and size. They are so comfortable that I wear them for hours (and the battery lasts multiple walking sessions of 5-11 miles or 3+ hours). I\'ve used them running and the tight, comfortable fit keeps perspiration out of my ears, so check, good for sports. The general sound is good. When using them for phone calls I\'ve never had a complaint either. My only gripe is when I turn up the music cymbals are really disappointing. Enough that I usually turn the volume back down.

The music quality was very poor --there was no bass whatsoever and yes, I did try all of the ear attachments as they suggest. Also, the max volume was not loud at all --sounded like listening to a concert with no bass end from outside the stadium a couple blocks down the street. I cannot imagine this product sells like this so maybe I was a lucky one who received a defective piece. Either way, got my money back on a Gift card and will try a different brand.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had these for almost a month and they're alright at best. I should have done more research on wireless earbuds before getting these. Sound quality is fine but the connection cuts in and out if I'm more than what seems like ten steps away from my device that's paired with these buds. Like another review pointed out, they are heavy and can fall out easily. I wear them at my stocking job and they're constantly needing to be pushed back in or adjust before they fall out. I can't even get through my meal break without them almost falling out because I'm chewing my food. If I didn't think returning used earbuds was disgusting I'd return these but I'll make do until I find a better pair that won't fall out so easily."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received these JVC earbuds and the first thing I noticed was they have come a long way from the last time I tried wireless earbuds. There is much to admire here even though I will say I'm a bit of an novice in this technology. The order was delivered to me and I immediately opened the package. The earbuds came in a case that doubles for charging and storing the earbuds. The earbuds were fully charged when I received them. Nice touch JVC. The buds and the case are a deep color blue - almost a navy blue. I might have small earholes but I had to use the smallest of the bud covers though they came with three different sizes. The earbuds connected synced quite easily through Bluetooth as you would expect. The sound seems to me to be better than average or at least better than I expected for these units. But, I'm not surprised. My experience with JVC has always been positive. I haven' listened to a lot of music lately. I have been taking my dog on extended walks and I am sure these earbuds will be a welcome addition to the walk. My guess is that these earbuds like everything else might be compared with Apple's earbuds. I have never listened to them but I am sure the JVC units are offered at a much more reasonable price. I would recommend these JVC wireless earbuds based on ease of setup, better than acceptable sound, the attractive price point and the slick case that charges and stores the earbuds conveniently."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I overall found these to be quality headphones. The paired right out of the box and had sufficient battery to go as soon as they were unboxed which was nice. The storage box has plenty of charge -- these will last for most walks or commutes. The memory foam within the earbuds is what really makes these nice. It molds the earbud into your ear and holds it securely. I don't like to run with earbuds on (cuz, SAFETY!) but I don't think these would bounce around in your ears the way others have on me. Overall the sound quality was nice. I have a nice pair of over the hear noise cancelling headphones I use (or used to use, thanks COVID-19) on long flights and I wouldn't trade those for these -- but for something small, unobtrusive, packable that delivers high quality sound while on the tread mill etc. theyre tough to beat, especially at this price point. I do have a couple complaint worth noting: The bluetooth connectivity got a little wonky if you try to manually turn them off and on instead of just using the storage box. I also did find it hard to use the controls on the device, they didn't seem to respond the way the instructions said they should -- I really couldn't get anything but single tap to work, double tap or long tap almost never worked. You also have to stand still to effectively use the buttons anyway, at which point it was easier to fish my phone out and just control from there. Neither of these are deal breakers as they don't impact day to day usage -- but worth noting."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are great wireless earbuds with good sound quality, easy to use features/controls and are very comfortable. They work well with my phone (Galaxy S9) for listening to music or taking a phone call. The memory foam tips are very comfortable and work a lot like earplugs. They really block out most external sounds so you can hear whatever you're listening to without distractions. A drawback to this would be if you're out walking or something where you sometimes need to hear things around you. The stated battery life is 4 hours, per the manufacturer's website, and can be recharged by the case for additional listening time, total time, per the manufacturer is 14 hours. They seem to last a long time, but I did not fully test until they were completely drained. Sound quality is excellent with good bass and clear highs. Call quality was also good. I could hear callers very well and they had no trouble hearing me. Out of the box they aren't charged, so you have to first plug in the case and let it charge, then put the earbuds inside the case to charge them. A little inconvenient, but not really unexpected. Once charged, remove them from the case and they power on, and if not paired, will go into pairing mode. Pretty standard to pair to any device. I actually had to research on the manufacturer's site how to pair to a second device as this information was not included or at least not obvious to me in the packaged instructions. My second device was my laptop, as I wanted to try them in a online meeting. The sound was fine, but for some reason the microphone would not work with my PC. I also watched a movie on my computer and the sound quality/immersive experience with headphones was excellent. If you don't like the memory foam tips, they also come with 3 sizes of the standard silicone tips. I didn't try those. The foam tips were very comfortable and it also comes with a replacement set for those. Controlling music and volume was pretty easy. Given the size, you don't get a lot of buttons, so the right earbud controls play/pause, volume up, and skip forward while the left controls play/pause, volume down, and skip backward. Overall, excellent wireless earbuds and a good value for the money.""]"

Only con, if it matters to you is noise cancelling. While great on pX7 s2s over the ear, the pI7s2s are non existent.

Now that I have the fully functional product: it\'s light, comfy, gives a lossless connection that wipes out the background noise handily, doesn’t surpise me in good or bad ways acoustically, and the case is good despite being a bit tight for the headset and included cables.

It feels like the original old Beats. looks good, feels good. so that's the reason why build is 4 stars if you know what old Beats feels like. The sound is relative good depends on what device you are using. It supports AAC and SBC. so if you use IPhone or IPAD, the default sound might be bit of different from the ones who use Android. I tested on both mobile systems. someone says bit of sound blurs, I wouldn't say it's not the truth. But it's all because the headphone is not tuned specifically for a platform when it's out of factory, but it also depends on the codec on your device as well. In this case, just download a equalizer software, 5 minutes work, get your favourite preference setup, the headphone would be awesome. I mean this one is pretty capable headphone which definitely worth more than $79 to me. plus, you get a leather case which is a good win as well. Since it needs to be tuned for my Andriod phone, I rate ease of use 3 stars. For IOS, it's actually better, no need to be tuned, especially for the music you bought from apple music store."", 'I had a pair of Monster Headphones prior to this monster headphones these ones sound fantastic I still getting used to them but I do love them.

"Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 True Wireless Earbuds - Active Noise Cancellation, Qualcomm aptX Technology, Bluetooth, Crystal-Clear Calls, Wireless & 15-Minute Quick Charging, Storm Grey",$268.58,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/bowers-wilkins-pi5-s2-true-wireless-earbuds-active-noise-cancellation-qualcomm-aptx-technology-bluetooth-crystal-clear-calls-wireless-15-minute-quick-charging-storm-grey/17970941/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 is a highly well-built IP54-rated and aesthetically pleasing pair of ANC in-ear earbuds. They support fast charging and are stored/charged in a case for wireless charging or USB-C. Sound codecs supported are aptX, SBC, and AAC via Bluetooth 5.0. The sound quality is just above average, with a small sound stage leaving much to be desired in the lows and mid ranges. Noise-canceling performance is just average, and battery life is subpar. The app could be better and takes away from the overall experience. ZERO personalization is offered for this price, not even a simple EQ to adjust—a feature in cheaper alternatives. No simultaneous multi-point connections, so forget about easy switching. You can only use these on one device at a time. Overall, better buds are out there for this price, so now we can get into the details. Design and Build 4/5 The Bowers & Wilkins Pi5 S2 is an elegant-looking earbud set. The earbuds are built tough, and I have no question that these will last, and they are just beautiful. The bulky charging case is designed to be upside-down with USB charging on the bottom. Inside the case, magnets REALLY hold these buds in place. Here lies my first gripe about using these; however, I can appreciate it because other companies have weak magnets. If you drop the case, it doesn\'t explode like a grenade sending your buds all over the room, but it would help if you had vice-grip fingertips to pull these out! The touch interface works well and registers fine, but that is the extent of it. You are stuck with how B&W designed these, so you can only change the ear tips and nothing more. The ear tips have foam inserts to help with isolation and keep earwax out of the sound chamber, BUT it does reduce the loudness. Much thought went into the physical design, but R & D needed to remember the user experience. Just a colossal oversight on execution and reminds me much of the Devialet Gemini launch. For some reason, hi-fi companies can\'t grasp UI for mobile phones and often leave excellent hardware to fail at the hands of a bad app. User Experience and Connectivity 2/5 The user experience is terrible on iOS and Android, from the initial pairing to the touch interface to the app interface and experience. The sound connection and levels often seem like the software is ""working"" on sound. Sometimes the volume is louder in one bud; then, it would work after tapping it to start and stop the feed. I often had to put my buds back in the case to fix sound issues, especially after connecting a second device. There are no issues with latency, and videos sync perfectly. The app is elementary and needs to be better thought out. ""Options and features"" are buried; for example, to activate pass-through to hear around you, you NEED to use the app! There is no way around it; you need to click three times while in the app just to turn it on. Once you open the app, you get a ""widget"" to activate only ANC. I use hear-through a lot, so needing this app to toggle it is a deal breaker. I need to turn this on and off with a touch of the bud. Another feature standard on other buds I have and use regularly. These are not going with me on a run or the gym, so it kills usage by making me go for others in my collection at this price range. Nothing useful can be found in the app and it is almost not needed. You can EQ in your music app maybe, but not with the B&W? I hope someone will fix this with updates. The app needs an overhaul and someone to think things through from a user standpoint. You cannot see the battery levels per earbud, and NOTHING shows for the case unless you step up to the Pi7 S2 for $100 more. HUGE MISS HERE with customizations, B&W. You cannot control the volume without your phone, you cannot EQ in-app, and you cannot change what various taps do. Other buds I use have a one-touch volume hold, so the volume increases until you let go, and the other side decreases volume the same way. I HATE the tones it plays when modes change and when it connects. Piercing and loud is the description at 0430am connecting to Bluetooth. I recommend that the tone be lowered an octave to make it more pleasing. Sound Quality and Battery Life 2/5 I expected an AMAZING sound from a prestigious company like Bowers & Wilkins. These buds offer codecs like aptX for higher-quality sound, but the speakers don\'t do it for me. Battery life is subpar and rated at 5hrs w/ ANC off and even worst with ANC on. I clocked 3.5ish hours with ANC on; then they turned off with yet another tune. The soundstage sounds puny compared to other buds in my collection at this price point, which could be better. There is no EQ to tune the sound to; you are stuck with hollow and weak lows and mids but nice highs. I am disappointed by the sound B&W produced with these in this price range. The sound quality between ANC on and off is night and day, with a white noise present when the buds are not playing anything. Turn on ANC, and the white noise is just higher pitched but lower in volume. The performance of these all the way around leaves a lot to be desired, and I cannot recommend these when the competition in this range is so fierce. I am frustrated by the overall experience put forth by Bowers & Wilkins. A company of this caliber should pay more attention to the details, especially in this digital age of apps and software. No customizations to interface or sound hold this hardware back, with the app being the main reason for this product\'s troubles and user experience. Connectivity issues were present from setup and trickled over to everyday use. There may be firmware updates to come out and fix some things, but these buds are not ready for primetime under the Bowers & Wilkins brand. I wanted to love these, but they cannot compete with others in their current software state.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Slick design, stylish look with an extremely comfortable fit for long hrs. of listening. Comes in great colors. The setup was a breeze and took me less than a minute to have it paired to the B&W app and my galaxy fold 4 phone. Touch controls are great and very responsive. Tested it while I was on a two-hour run and felt very comfortable having it for two straight hours. Its IP54 rated meaning, resists dust and water splashes. It has a 9.2mm dynamic driver with defining range, the bass which falls in lows or low midrange is below my expectations (varies with individual love for bass) and expected more given its price. The mids and highs are amazingly good, crisp audio, richer and more lively audio experience for all genres even at high volume. These earbuds definitely stand out on the audio clarity among 20+ ones I reviewed so far when it comes to picking up the mids and highs. Key features • Good battery life. Lasted a little over 4.5 hrs. at normal volume and 19 hrs. of listening time with the case battery. • Uses Bluetooth 5.0 which is the latest standard with increased Bluetooth range - up to 85 ft. The connectivity range is impressive and didn't have any issues with connectivity while walking around a 2 floor home with my phone sitting in a corner room. • ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) is above average when I compare my experience to the high-end earbuds that are in the same price range. I tried Pi5 S2 and two others on a plane ride and felt the Pi5 S2 can do a little better on the noise cancellation feature. I love the transparency or pass through mode - low and high settings, great to hear music while being more attentive to surrounding noise, especially while I am out on a run. • Mic quality is amazing, didn't have any issues hearing others and talking to people while I was at the airport and on the plane. Had a few glitches where the earbuds connectivity was flaky and cut out couple times after few hours of listening. It happened a couple times and I had to disconnect and reconnect the earbuds to fix it. I wasn't sure if it was my phone (galaxy fold 4) or the app or the buds. Looking for an app/software update if this is related to the earbuds. Didn't have any issues with other earbuds though. Also, the earbuds doesn't stay connected on the B&W app all the time, so you have reconnect to the app to change the settings or try out other features. The app needs some improvement and a few more features for audio settings - personalized equalizer settings would be a good addition. Overall, I am impressed by the audio quality, the design and comfort for long hours of listening and would highly recommend it. I was always impressed by B&W's new products and the amazing sound quality they have on their audio devices. As an audiophile, I am always on the lookout for the best, and B&W never failed to impress me with their innovative technology. The app needs a little improvement along with the few fixes on the earbuds for flaky connection at times. It also needs a little improvement on the ANC technology to be on par with earbuds in that price range."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First Impression - Opening the box reveals a nicely packaged product with the literature and cords in the bottom. I removed everything and charged them up in the case to prepare them. Everything appears / feels very well made. The earbuds seat nicely in the charging case. I left the default size ear cups installed and fit them in my ears after checking some photos for proper orientation. They have a very nice and secure fit - I could run with these in easily and not worry about loosing one. Sound - Wow - the drivers in these ! I ripped through a standard set of tunes I like to flex earbuds and headphones with. All are encoded in FLAC ( lossless ) and let\'s just say it\'s quite the mix. Classical, Acoustic, live recordings, metal, pop, jazz . . .A little of everything. The all around profile on these is quite warm with excellent highs. On the low to mid end the drivers in these simply outstanding given all that is stuffed into these small battery powered wireless devices. These are the first pair of earbuds that can compete with my somewhat high end wired earbuds. These can actually be used for phone calls and have noise cancelling so I may be moving away from the wired world soon ! Use - I paired these with my gaming PC first. I have a bluetooth 5.1 dedicated adaptor with an external antenna that I use for extended range but that can conveniently be used for ""range testing"". I was able to wander all over my house with these without dropout or breaks in receiving playback. I then installed the app on my iphone - no issues. The app allows for naming the headphones and adjusting the noise cancelling mode as well as flipping the value for ""wear sensor"" i.e. pause when earbud removed as well as the Auto-Connect to last device setting. Next I paired these with my work laptop to use for calls in teams and zoom. They work perfectly for that and the other parties in calls had no issues hearing my voice. These actually perform extremely well for calls where ambient noise is not easily picked up and transmitted along with voice. I did find myself going back to the iphone pairing and turning OFF the ""remember last device"" pairing setting so I could switch when desired between Gaming PC / Work PC / Iphone. These remember four devices and I had no issues switching between three different devices with the previously mentioned setting turned to OFF. Noise cancelling - has three levels for pass through. They work well however I cannot seem to change them without the app. I can turn ON or OFF on the earbud - but I have yet to figure out how to adjust the level without the app. Overall - A really great set of ANC earbuds. What I love: Excellent fit - they are very lightweight 5 hours with ANC off - That\'s about 2.5x Airpods ! Fast charge mode - 15 minutes in the case = 2 hours ! Room for improvement: Can I switch ANC pass thru level on the earbuds ? I read the manual . . A paired device toggle mode would be great.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bowers & Wilkins' second iteration of their Pi5 S2 Earbuds brings great features and bass-oriented sound to its listeners. The Pi5 S2 Earbuds, while on the larger side compared to other earbuds, are comfortable and fit well. The S2s can last for 5 hours without needing to recharge with noise cancellation on and an additional 19 hours through its charging/holding case. While on the larger side also, the charging case can provide about 2 hours worth of audio time with just 15 minutes of charging! It is also wireless charging compatible so you do not need to plug in a USB C cable into the case to charge. These earbuds have some of the latest features other headphones are starting to incorporate. They offer adjustable noise cancellation, tap features on the earbuds themselves (turn on/off noise cancellation, pause/play music, and more), and smart voice assistant features including Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The noise cancellation feature on the S2s also allows for selective noise passthrough; you can allow little, medium, or no external audio (audio from your surroundings or environment) via a setting on the Music - Bowers & Wilkins mobile app. This was a neat feature and I did notice a difference with each level of noise passthrough. This made it super convenient when needing to speak to someone without removing my earbuds. Now for the audio. The audio sounded amazing and what you would expect from Bowers & Wilkins. I did notice the bass on the heavier side (It reminds me of the sound another company offers that is closely related to the spelling of a group of vegetable (beets)) but not distracting enough to not notice the synths and instruments in the music I listened to. (I can see where people will say the bass can be overpowering, but others, I think, will find they prefer it that way). Aside from the bass, music was rich and I enjoyed listening to classic rock albums such as the Beatles’ Abbey Road and Hip Hop albums. Now for the cons. I found that the Music B&W app doesn't offer an equalizer or way to adjust the audio frequencies. This would help tweak the bass for those that prefer a more balanced listening session. Secondly, I found that the noise canceling was lacking. For the price point, I expected it to do an even better job at muffling my surroundings. Third, I found that when using the S2s for calls, the microphone captured much of my surroundings and made it difficult to use in busy areas. Other headphones I’ve used were able to block out most of the background noise. Lastly, since the S2s are IP54 rated for sweat and water resistance, I decided to test them while exercising. While exercising and running, I noticed I had to readjust them in my ears to not fall out. Overall, the B&W Pi5 S2 earbuds sound great and offer several features, but lack details that could push them above the competition. I still recommend them to those that are looking for incredibly sounding earbuds and have an equalizer embedded in their music player. Additionally, while they do not have an all-muffling noise cancellation, having decent selective noise cancellation is very convenient, especially when around others."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had high hopes for the Pi5 S2 earbuds from B&W. Being one of the best brands in the business of sound, I expected to be blown away by these. I\'ve been blown away, but for all the wrong reasons... The setup process with these was nothing short of a nightmare. Pairing to my Pixel 6 Pro (on the latest version of Android) took the better part of an hour. The phone could see the earbuds almost immediately, but simply wouldn\'t connect. After multiple tires, restarts, holding the pairing button on the case, removing and replacing the buds, it eventually worked for reasons that are unknown to me. Incredibly frustrating from the very beginning... Perhaps this is an anomaly in my specific case (I sure hope it is tbh). I did notice that it listed ""iPhone"" as a previous connection in the app so either there\'s a bug in the app on first load, or these were previously used which maybe would explain my pairing woes. The ergonomics on these things is pretty poor. They look great, no denying that, but the case door has a propensity to close on its own, which wouldn\'t be an issue except for the fact that it took me forever to pair them and you have to leave the door open while pairing. Once they\'re in your ear, the design makes it difficult to remove them, at least for me. Negating that, the fit in my ears is great, though. Took about 5 seconds to realize that you place them in the ""vertical position"" and rotate them. I just wish they were easier to grab to remove. Finally, I\'m quite disappointed with the sound quality. The aforementioned issues are ones I could look past, but once I finally got these working, I was blown away by how pedestrian they sound to my ears. They lack the kind of punch in the lows and presence in the mids that I\'ve come to expect from ear buds of this caliber (at least price wise). I own a number of noise cancelling buds from other brands, and these don\'t hold up from the sound quality perspective. I really wanted to love these ear buds. I was fully ready to retire my Bose and Sony buds, but these just aren\'t doing it for me. My experience was tainted by the setup process and then completely crushed by the sound.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The B&W Pi5 earbuds are great. They fit well, sound great, and all the features you could need. They have very decent bass response, and the highs never sound harsh or brash. I upgraded from the Jabra 65t's and these definitely sound better. Phone calls sound good, and voice clarity is more than decent. The available app is overall not necessary, but when used it does function as expected and allows for simple control of some features such as ANC. Bluetooth syncing to an iphone works fine once you figure out that you have to sync to the charging case first, and then that allows the phone to pair with the headphones. After the first time though, it just pairs to the headphones as expected with no issues. I like these a lot. They sound good, fit great, and work easily and reliably."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hate these things so much. Don’t buy them. I’ve got the best iphone on the planet. Still. They keep disconnecting or stop playing on their own! Without me doing anything to them! They’re just in my ear! Plus. They fall out all the time and! They’re super bulky! Hate them. Will be returning them. ASAP. Very disappointed. That’s why they’re on sale! I’ll try the best newest ones just to be sure.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] They have a great sound. However, the battery is not good, does not last more then a few hours and then beeps a few times and dies out of nowhere. Also a little bulky but they do stay put halfway decent. Probably will return and get something different', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Bowers & Wilkins did a good job . I give it 4 stars because there's a few things that they can improve on. Ill start off with the negatives. You only get 5 hours playtime so if you need something for a 8 hour work day this is not the earbuds for you. The case is big compared to other companies that have smaller ones. When i was setting it up i did not like the fact that i had to pair it to the phone and then also pair it with the app. I would be nice if when i use the app that it does everything in the setup. When on calls i feel like it can do better, because the music and movies sound amazing on these earbuds. Now with the things done correctly. Sound is A+ for music and movies as i said before . Build quality it feels premium i love the touch controls and the fit is nice you get 3 tips and a usb c cable. As for the mic everyone said i sounded good and was i sounded clear as day. The tips are well made too they are siilicon and seal well. The noise canceling was good too .it did block alot of the external noise. Ambient sound was good too i can hear cars and most of my surroundings"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are fairly comfortable and very easy to insert. The cover the range of highs and lows fairly well. They have a good bass thump and clarity is very impressive. Noise cancelling is among the the best I have heard in earbuds. Phone calls are clear and easy to hear and be understood. The touch controls are very simple and straight forward. I really like that you can answer a call from either earbud as most sets I have come across from competitors are limited to the right earbud for calling. Unboxing was very clean and simple and pairing was fast and easy with the one touch button on the case. The aesthetic is clean, though can look a little like having Frankenstein bolts coming out of your ears. The passthrough feature is useful, but I prefer to keep it off as I find it negates a bit of the noise cancelling feature when listening music. To test the noise cancelling I played music on my home theater system at a comfortable volume then played music over my earbuds at the same time and could barely hear my home theater at all. I tested a range of music from classical, pop, R&B, alternative rock and all came through beautifully.']"

I tested these out at the gym last night and this morning - they fit nicely into my ears and stay snug. The sound quality lacks some of the low end that I am used to, but for a wired set and being so inexpensive, I\'ve got no room to complain on the sound. The only complaint I have is the length of the cord, and that\'s only because I keep my phone in my pocket and not in an arm band - an arm band would make the length of the cord perfect! Between the ""Y-split"" and the plug, it\'s only about 2 feet long. From the split to the earpieces is only about 1 foot to each ear. I\'d prefer a little longer.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] WOW wasn\'t expecting this! These are a good cheap set of in-ear headphones. They have good sound and are quite comfortable. The design is water-resistant and uses a rubber cover(2 sizes included) to direct sound into your ear. They also serve as a ""wing"" to set the plugin your ear and prevent displacement. The sound was good for the pricing - High and mids were great but the lows were a bit diminished. No clipping though. I did find that lower volumes were muddy. The only issue I foresee is the durability longterm. but given the price point. It is what it is. Good product, good sound, good function. Serves its purpose at a good price point.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC Gummy ear buds are a great option for anyone that's looking for a cheap set of buds that stay in your ears during workouts. The sound quality on these is about what you'd expect for a set in this price range; decent, present bass, pushed mids, and slightly lacking highs. They get the job done, though. More importantly, to me at least, is that they have an incredibly comfortable and secure fit that means they stay put while running. As an added extra, they also have a mic which allows you to take calls with them, too. Overall, these are a solid pair of friendly priced ear buds that are effective for working out."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JVC HA ENR15 Gumy Sport headphones are a good set of headphones for the price. Sound quality is ok. Highs are crisp and voices are clear. They are a little light on bass, though. The earbuds feel sturdy and are listed as being ""sweat-proof"". They fit comfortably in my ears and felt very secure. The cord seems a little thin, though I\'ve had no problems with it. The remote/microphone feels plasticy and seems situated a bit too high on the cord for my tastes. Included with the purchase is a larger set of earpieces and a set of instructions explaining the remote\'s functionality. All in all, these headphones are a perfectly serviceable set inexpensive sport headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a great listening experience to my ears with these budget JVC Gummy In-Ear Headphones. The first time I plugged headphones into the jack on my phone the sound blasted out loud and clear. The nozzle ear pieces are an easy fit and comfort when listening or active. The one button convenient remote takes care of the three functions of play/pause, skip and call with a 1, 2, 3 press of remote. The mic works great in receiving and making calls. JVC is known for leading the way in audio technology from the bottom to top in product price range. The JVC Gummy Wired In-Ear Headphones is evident.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are pretty good wired in-ear headphones, especially for the price.

These earphones have decent midrange as well as the full spectrum for listening to music. I have some Sony wired earphones that have slightly better quality of sound but I don't know which model but these JVC Gumy Wired in-ear headphones are good for the price. They are also comfortable and stay in while I exercise on my elliptical."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall, these are not going to replace even the headphones that come with most phones, definitely not the one's included with most flagship phones. However, even though the build quality and in-line controls feel cheap, they are really very durable! I like to keep a pair of backup headphones in my bag just in case the mood hits me to go for a walk or a situation arises where you may want to use a set of headphones, these fit that role perfectly! They are inexpensive enough that if they do end up breaking, you won't feel too bad about it before you go out and buy another pair. The two included ear channel tips are very comfortable and offer good noise dampening with just enough surrounding noise coming through to stay aware of your surroundings but they do a great job of keeping your audio to you. I received good feedback on call quality, both sides of the call (what I heard and what the recipient heard) are clear and crisp. Music quality is missing a lot on the upper and lower frequencies but for a back up pair of earbuds and for running, they sound good. Overall, for the price, these headphones offer a lot of value and great flexibility for use!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am not a very big fan of these headphones. Aside from the fact that they are advertised as sweat resistant which may be good for people exercising, that is about where the excitement ends. Upon receiving these headphones, I opened them and connected them to my cellular phone. I listened to a few clips of some songs that I like and I was not impressed. The audio quality is not all that great. I did not feel that there was any bass response in these headphones as well. The rubber ear pieces seem to fit okay and not fall out during movement, but they are not very comfortable overall. The overall build feels very cheap as would be expected for heaphones at this price point. All in all, do yourself a favor, purchase a higher quality pair of headphones.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My JVC wired in-ear headphones are perfect. They fit extremely comfortably in my ear, not too far in like earbuds. The large part of the ear piece fills the center of the outer ear very securely. I never need to re-adjust them. It reduces the outside noise enough to adequately hear my music and still react to any sounds around me. That is an absolute necessity for me when out walking. I would have liked an all-black design, but it is perfect in every other way. The sound quality is very good and overall well worth the price.']"

Considering they are not nor have I experienced active noise cancelling headphones, I think these are a top notch product, but I do wish a couple of things were better or different. It would be nice if I could increase the volume of the ambient sound and use the buds as what would effectively be hearing aids. I also have trouble from time to time with the buds thinking my double tap is a triple tap, so I'm not sure what's going on there. Maybe add a hardware button as an option instead of tapping? I also wish the buds had more options for the taps. It would be nice if I could fast forward or rewind with continuous tapping or 5+ taps. Other than these things, I'm a fan and will consider buying future Buds releases."", 'After having great success with the Wyze Bud Pro and Wyze Noise Canceling headphones, I thought I’d give them a shot since My wife ended up loving my Pros so much that they became hers. Since I really needed the for the gym, I wasn’t too upset about missing the noise canceling. They are a little bigger than the Pros, but still fit quite well. They took a little time to figure out the fitment, but after that. WOW! The sound quality was amazing. The bass is there and the battery life is also wonderful. My only complaint is that I have d to speak a little louder than I had been use to, but it’s a decent trade off for the price point. Overall, I would still recommend them to anyone looking for great headphones.', 'These ear buds are affordable and have great sound quality. The equalizer within the app is a top notch feature. 10 out of 10 I would recommend these to anybody.', 'Active bypass vs regular can make the buds nonoperational in windy, busy area or around the farm/mowing the lawn', 'Great value, love the ease of connectivity.

I also like that they have noise cancelation and setting that allows ambient noise in if I want it. My only criticism is a minor one...on occasion, after I have taken action to disconnect them from my phone, they will reconnect on their own (Android). But this is a small occasional annoyance. Highly recommend these buds, great value.', 'Great great sound… love the fit for sure. The connectivity to the iPhone is not seamless like it is with AirPods. (Maybe I’m spoiled). But if I can connect to my phone and my computer, respectively, and lets say the last connection was my computer, then it’s super annoying to have to go find the computer to disconnect first before I can connect to the phone. Why can’t I just choose “connect” in my iPhone settings and have the buds disconnect from the laptop and connect to the phone. I’m trying to run out the door and I have to stop, go back in, up three flights to the computer to disconnect the buds before it’ll let me use them with my phone.', 'They are okay. They are typical of the current ""true wireless"" product out there. They seem a little bulky but that does allow for a decent touch surface area. The problem I have with all these buds is figuring out the combination of taps to get them to do what I want. There\'s no standardization among the brands. They hook up easily and sound is fine but I am not as sensitive to that kind of thing. The price is right and as I have a lot of Wyze products I like having some uniformity in brands. I think most people will be happy with them. I didn\'t give them a very high rating as I haven\'t had them long enough to rate their overall performance.', 'Awesome product! The ambient noise is an awesome feature than makes using these while workout even better when you lift with a friend on occasion.']"

The 2nd is the retractable mic. If not needed just fold it. The headset is lightweight with the padded suspension headband. I would say it's not really full noise cancelling headset because I can still hear noises wearing the headset with or without music presence. Also the headset is compatible to any electronics tried it with my ps4, the mac and phone even. I dont like how big is the headset but it's kinda good that it covers the entire ear and no worries of hurting the ears. The music, bass is clear when using the headset."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The is headset is well manufactured. The metal, self-adjusting headband fits well without feeling too snug or loose. The ear pads and headband are very well padded that you forget you are even wearing them after several hours. The best feature is noise cancelling. I submerged myself in the game without any external disturbances and was able to utilize the retractable microphone so other players were only hearing me and no other sounds in my home. I could readily control the volume and mute myself with the control on cable. It comes with an audio jack and a USB adapter so it is compatible with multiple devices. The experience I achieved with this headset is unlike any other headset I have owned. My son has used it as well and we have been “fighting” for headset time. I plan on getting him this for Christmas! The sound quality is superb. The sound is so crisp and clear that you actually feel that you are an actual character within the game and not just a player. These could also be used to listen to music or view a movie.', 'They work fine, sound is ok and they are comfortable enough. Cable is long and had both USB and 3.5 mm jack. Only issue is they are really big.', 'The quality of the material construction is above average. The overarching headband is metal, so should last a long time. Cord is a woven cloth instead of the typical plastic sheath. The earcups are very large, so my ears fit inside the earpads instead of resting on the ears, so these can be worn for extended hours without discomfort. The cord length using the mini-stereo jack is on the short side, but the included extension to convert from stereo to USB alleviates this minor concern. I like that the microphone retracts instead of swiveling or unplugging when not in use. The sound is good and comparable to a quality pair of headset speakers.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] ""Average"" is the perfect word to describe this headset. The sound quality is decent for $80 but the cups don\'t swivle so you have perfectly vertical cups squishing you face and leaving open gaps around the cushions. The headset is very light and looks good enough ascetic wise, but without the swivle feature like most headsets have, I\'m pretty disappointed in not only the comfort, but the sound quality due to no ""suction"" around you head. I wouldn\'t tell someone not to buy these, but I also wouldn\'t recommend them. For $80 you could buy a decent pair off Amazon and probably be more comfortable and have almost the same sound quality.', ""I've bought other gaming headsets for about the same price (or more expensive) and this is by far the best one I've ever used. I usually have issues with sound pickups because I share an office with my husband and we can hear eachother's typing and talking through both our mics. We just deal with it or one person turns their mic off and we both talk and it picks us up. BUT THIS HEADSET OMG!!! Even with my SUPER loud typing, the mic DOESN'T pick it up.

My favorite feature has to be the massive size of the over the ear part of the headset! Never had I had a headset that sits so perfectly outside my ears! They are so comfortable because they are not crushing my ears at all, which has often been a problem I’ve had with previous headsets!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First thing to notice is how they fit, the cushions are very comfortable, fit nice around the ears and don't squeeze them or cause pain which also helps with noise canceling function which definitely works great here. Love the fact that mic can be pulled out and in, helps to avoid damage when not used, users on the other side confirmed that i sound loud and clear so mic works good. It weight is great also, not too heavy not too light, might seem bulky but definitely doesn't feel like that when you put it on. Sound is clear and very satisfying but right when i put those headsets on i wanted make it louder and sadly it was at the max, i wish there was function to tweak bass and treble or make it louder, also some led lights would make nice addition to it. Overall its great product i just like my headsets little louder."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like the Omen Blast Headsets, I have been using them online mostly while watching videos or playing games.

Although they do not completely block out all background noise they do a pretty good job. They are larger than other headsets I have tried and completely cover my ears and are VERY comfortable. The volume and mute are easily accessible and in the same place. They sound great, rather it is games, music, movies, or video conferences. I am very pleased with them and will be using them even I am in my completed office.', 'I used to own the omen 800 headphones. I really liked them and had them for about 3 years but recently one of the ears died so I decided to buy the same ones again but it seems HP replaced them with these blast ones.

Most likely will throw these away once I find anyone who still has stock of the old omen 800 ones.']"

Been using them with Teams and they’re very easy to set up and get working very quickly. I can spend anywhere from 30 minutes to 5-6 hours on calls each day and these have been very comfortable. Excellent noise cancellation without making me feel like my head in encased in cans even with just the mono version. I prefer a single ear so I can monitor my own voice volume (no one likes the noisy guy in the office!) and these are great for that, again, super comfy and very easy to use. The sound quality is excellent with a decent range for when I need to get up and walk around while on calls. Pleasantly surprising was the fact that there was practically no dropout until I got to the limits of the range which was more than adequate.

Jvc In-Ear/Ear Bud Wireless Bluetooth Headphone (HA-FX9BT-A) - Blue,$30.93,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-in-ear-ear-bud-wireless-bluetooth-headphone-ha-fx9bt-a-blue/11795152/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Truth be told I ended up purchasing these headphones on a whim while at the store. I was specifically looking for a secondary pair of headphones that were Bluetooth and affordable to use as a backup while my main pair would charge in the middle of streaming a show or movie. Little did I expect that I would get quite so much bang for my buck with this purchase. For starters, the sound quality for this price point is not bad at all. The tips provide a generally comfortable fit for prolonged use. But by far, the thing I did not expect was the exceptional battery life for this price. This blew my Anker wireless Liberty headphones out of the water by comparison. What a great choice. And they charge pretty fast too considering it is via micro-USB. Well done, JVC.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like my JVC ear buds. They are great, easy to use and have great clarity. But, because I didn't need these pair of ears, I returned them. I did not even try them. But, if this product is like the JVC ear buds, you will spend $15-$30 on these ear buds. They are better than more expensive audio ear phones."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have a difficult time keeping the ear budd in my ears. I have tried to put the smaller plastic pieces on and still fall out all the time. Its hard to find the small buttons and takes a few tried to get volume to go up are down. I guess I will get use to them and finding the buttons will become easier. Sound is ok. I do like the bluetooth range. I didn't want to spend the 40 dollars to replace my MEE bluetooth headphones and I really liked the MEE. I might keep these for a backup and purchase the MEE. The did pair very quickly to the MEE receiver. They do the job they were intended to do but I dont think they are worth 20 dollars. You get what you pay for."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] (Lost the previous one), just bought 2 more. Though not for Audiophiles, it\'s perfect for Podcasts, and Classes. (It\'s louder than comparable JLabs, for hard of hearing folk like me). Suits my NON-MUSIC/or NON-PHONE CALL needs. (NOTE: Not very clear for Phone calls! I sounded a bit ""sh, sh, sh,"" in my ""Esses"" (""S""). But, for Podcasts, and Directions on car, and for Classes, these allow you to have a louder, more audible volume than the JLabs. OTOH, on Phone Calls, I did sound better on the JLabs, (albeit they severely limit sound levels, which is a problem for me, w/ hearing issues). These JVCs—being less-restrictive on audio levels—are more practical and useful, to me.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great value at $10 (Black Friday price). Works great for phone calls + listening to music on my mobile phone. Headphones have good audio clarity and are comfortable. The design is better than the prior brand/model of phones that I had as the microphone is inline with the wires that suspends from the ears (the prior brand/model I had required the microphone/controller to be clipped onto collar of clothing making it less functional for some use cases). The prior brand/model design eventually failed do to me wrapping the wires around microphone/controller for compact storage. I haven’t make the same mistake with the JVC Gumy wireless headphones – they are still working after 2 years.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I got these for $15. The listening experience is Okay.. The microphone is absolute garbage, get used to hearing ""What?"" a lot. The controls are strange, often, when increasing volume, you will skip a song by accident. They are not very comfortable but the noise isolation is decent. The volume, for some reason, isn\'t stepped in equal increments, especially low volume. Bare with me here. Say you sleep with these and want to lower the volume. Step 2 is 20% and step 1 is 3%. So they are either too loud to sleep or you can\'t hear your book. Upward from there it is strange but workable. All in all I would not buy them again but they are what they are. Cheap wireless headphones. Charge is okay.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds are fabulous! First of all they are under $25 - you really don't need to spend a fortune to get good earbuds. The sound quality on these is excellent. I plug these into my lamptop, my tablet, and my phone and I've never had any problems with the sound. What I really love is the gummy piece that goes into the ear. It's super soft and squishy so even if you wear these buds for many hours (and I have) they are still comfortable.

They come in a hard case that is also the recharger for the ear buds them selves and they are well protected. But, there is a problem. I have had these for about a year now with no connection or charging problems until now. Two days ago I noticed the right ear bud (this charges in the left slot of the case) was not charged and would not charge no mater how often I placed it in the case. When I finally took a closer look at the case its self, I found that one of the charging pins (upper pin in the left charging position) had retracted into the case (these are evidently spring activated to make contact), was stuck in the down position and was no longer making contact with the ear bud and not charging it when placed in the case. I tried a few things to get it to charge including placing it in the opposite side, with no results. The right side ear bud is no longer charged and I am relegated to the use of one ear bud only which cuts out part of the reception. Unfortunately, there is no alternative way of charging these ear buds; which I see as a design flaw. If and when something like this happens, there should be another way of charging; a micro USB for instance.

The suggested software Armoury Crate is garbage and seems to be the cause of the majority of the issues that plagued me the first couple days. At first the mic would cut in and out intermittently and had a bad feedback loop. All that went away after uninstalling ASUS Armoury crate. Can't explain why. But since getting rid of it the headset has been fine. Outside of that the only annoying feature is the auto shutoff we activated after a certain amount of time of no audio output. Some games I play have frustratingly long load in times to servers <tarkov> and it will shut off often while I wait, which is really only a minor inconvenience, but it is one.

I have tried other wireless headphones before but these ones fit nicely because of the hooks and I don't have to worry about them popping out of my ears, especially while brisk walking or running. The charging case is light and compact, seating the ear buds well. The chord is short and the case charges for about 3.5 hours with its indicator light on. The earbuds then have to be put in, and the case is charged further for 2 more hours. I used the headphones for 4 - 5 hours each day, and they lasted several days without any recharging required. The first pairing was very quick, thereafter there was an automatic connection when taken out of the case. The sound quality is very good, most of the noise gets blocked out, if not all of it. The earbuds are light and do not press hard into my ear, even if I wear them for a long time. The touch sensor on the earbuds make it easy to adjust the volume, pause, restart or move the audio track forward and back. There is a variety of ear pieces included in the pack, I prefer the medium size as it fits my ears well and cancels out the noise adequately. Overall these are good quality wireless headphones that fit snug, have great sound, with a long lasting battery life and are fairly priced."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These JVC SportsTrue Wireless earbuds are nice for workouts. FIT - These buds come with multiple soft gel/silicone tips and the soft rubber ear hook. I really like the hook, no more losing my earbuds if I bend over to far for too long. The fit is nice. I can wear them all day with no problems. Battery life is excellent as well. The case is a bit large, as needed to fit this hook style earbud, so don’t expect to conceal this case in your pocket. That being said, they do fit nicely and charge your earbuds to up to 30 hrs. There is also only one status light on the front. I would like to see either multiple lights or color changing to indicate the battery life of the case. When you remove the buds from your case they reconnect nicely to my phone. Touch pad – the touch response is very nice. Both left and right respond quickly to touch commands. Left touch sensor assignment: 1x – Play/Pause 2x – Vol. Down 3x – Vol Up Right touch sensor assignment: 1x – Play/Pause 2x – Next Song 3x – Prev. Song Hold for 1 Second to choose sound mode: Normal, Bass, Clear (you do get an audible sound telling you what mode you have chosen) Oh- and what the directions DON’T tell you, is you can hold for 3 seconds to turn either earbud ON or OFF. This is a nice feature if you don’t have the case nearby. There is no phone app available, so other than the modes mentioned above, all your sound is controlled from you connected device. Bluetooth works great. No connection issues at all and I can walk a nice distance from my phone without losing connection. Sound – I must start by saying I have many pairs of higher quality earbuds, so the comparison might not be fair. With that said, I am a bit disappointed with the lower end sound. I do realize these are more of a budget pair of earbuds but to me the lower mid and bass is just not there. Call Quality is okay, a little tinny on the receiver’s end. PROS: - Light - Comfort - Ease of operation - Battery life - Bluetooth Connection - CONS: - Sound quality – lack of lower end and bass Overall, I use these when I am doing activities where I know my other earbuds might fall out. I also listen to pod casts and talk radio, so the bass is not all that important. So if the fit and flexibility of Bluetooth is what you are looking for, then these will work fine. If you’re an audiophile, then these are not a good choice, spend a little more and look for another option.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Good basic set of bluetooth sports ear buds. It does lack the deeper bass sounds for music, but they work. You can hear clearly. Easy to link to your device. Comes with a USB charging cord & case, but no adapter plug.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have tried all types of wireless listening devices from full over-the-ear, bone conduction, around the ear and in-ear ear buds. For use during exercise, these are the best I have found so far. Over-ear headphones do the job when it comes to noise cancellation and sound quality but can get heavy over time. Bone conduction headphones are lighter but have poorer sound quality and no real noise cancellation as they are not designed for that. The trade-off is poorer sound quality, especially when working out in a gym with its own music blaring. In-ear devices come close, but I found them uncomfortable over time because of the size required to stay in your ear during exercise. These JVC are the perfect balance of comfort, sound quality, and features for me. The Bluetooth connection was quick and easy. The few functions – Play, Pause, Volume Up Volume Down, change in sound style – re easy to learn and respond to my finger tap most of the time. Battery life is good and the comfort is excellent. Overall, I am very happy with this JVC model and they will become my go-to listening device when exercising.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For a cheaper brand these have excellent sounds. The buttons that are not buttons can be a little touchy but other than that these are perfect', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just know that I really like my earphones they're a comfortable fit and the sound is nice and clear and easy on my ears."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Believe it or not these sound better then beats just ordered 2 more pairs for friends', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After I bought it it falls down and breaks down I have to use only one of them', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Not working after a month one side is real low other side not working!!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love them, very comfortable and good quality for the price']"

I don't want a lot of layers or padding in a bra when I am sweating! Even my sports bras are too heavy for me out in the heat. I have worn these several times already and I love that they are breathable and dry quickly. If you are looking for a lot of support and or coverage I would recommend making a different selection. If you are looking for something lightweight and extremely comfortable, I would recommend them. I am normally sized for a small, but I ordered one size up to a medium because I wanted the flexibility of movement and didn't want a tight fit."", 'This is the second time that I have purchased these bras. I use them for sleeping. My ""girls"" have sagged as I\'ve aged, and I found myself waking several times a night due to discomfort. These bras keep them supported enough to allow for better sleep. The fact that they are nearly all cotton is especially good for summertime wear, as I stay cooler. (I bought the two-packs of white and pink, which have the most cotton. Read the fabric content for the other colors, as some have more synthetic fibers) I would give them 5 stars if they shaped a bit better, but otherwise I\'m happy with my purchase.', ""Sizing chart is completely off.

The large is suggested for those with a band size of up to 38 inches and a D cup. Um, no. Yes, the fabric can stretch but not that much! I was able to get it on but it was quite snug around both my ribs and breasts. The materials for the white/pink bra combo are listed on the Hanes website as being cotton and spandex.

I am a petite, muscular lady with a size 36B. If I am in a store and I really like a bra I see and I don't see it in my size, I will go to a 34B/C, it just fits a little snug. I ordered a medium in this and have NO issues. It is soft and provides support. I had no issue getting it over my head.

While the price of the 2 pack is extremely economical, the material and fit of the bra is also very, very comfortable. The sport bra that crosses in the back, has stopped the straps from slipping off my shoulders. That slippage has caused me a lifetime of discomfort with every bra I have ever owned, my shoulders must have a peculiar shape. The crossover back shows with some types of garment, but the comfort of being able to wear a bra all day with no strap slippage far out weights that fact.', 'Weak or poor elastic caused it to roll up inside the seam band with no way to straighten it out. My previous ones with the Hanes name printed on the breast did not have this problem.', ""I wish I could give this bra a 5-star review! I love the cut, fit, stretchy fabric, solid construction, and great price. BUT I tend to have sensitive skin and whatever thread and type of stitching was used in sewing the bra made the seams all so scratchy I couldn't stand wearing it, even after a couple of washings hoping to soften it up. I also tried wearing it inside out, thinking maybe with the smoother side on my skin I wouldn't feel the seams as much, but that didn't help enough. If it weren't too scratchy to wear, it would probably be my favorite casual bra."", ""I use these bras as home and sleep bras. Best affordable sleep bras ever!! I've always worn sleep bras, I used to wear regular bras to sleep until I found these. Now I have 6 of them and plan to order more so I don't have to laundry as much. I'm 48 years old and my boobs are very perky (not saggy) and still look like they did in my twenties and the only thing I can attribute it to wearing a bra 24/7 my whole entire life! Also when I exercise I wear a sports bra. Point is I never go without a bra, even when I'm sleeping; I never let my boobs sag down. These bras as sleep bras are perfect because they're extremely comfortable, almost like not wearing a bra and yet still give me the support I seek when winding down and going to sleep."", ""I didn't get these to work out in, although if I wore two at once I would have the support to do low impact workout. I wear these for running errands, working around the house, sleeping. They are very comfortable, with no metal, plastic or adjustable straps. The printed one I bought is a little smaller than the others (all are L size). If I had it to do all over again, I would have bought XL because I'm a 34DD and I think the chest band would have been a little more roomy. All in all, a great, comfortable bra to end the day in or spend the weekends in."", ""I have bought and had to return many brands of casual/sleep bras. I am a 3x and the bottom band was always uncomfortable. I ordered 2 sets of the pink/white in cotton/spandex. Love them, ordered 2 more sets. I wear them on the days I don't want to fool with the underwires and hooks of my regular bras and also to sleep in. The price is fantastic!!! However, now I'm not sure if I should order more colors with the polyester blend included. Any 3x'ers have any comments on those?

Has a amazing isolation for inearbuds microphone so on the receive end will always say it clear no matter the sound in the background. I also like that it connects instantly to my phone and PS5. Hear it at the sametime if Im listening to a podcast and gaming. The only problem when I use bluetooth on my phone it will disconnect Milisecond but thats because the range is not that large so i have PS Pulse Earbuds facing downward so the connection stronger. I haven't had no lost connection after doing that"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ordered: Dec 5th 10:19pm PST and delivered on Dec 7th 10:30am PST! Absolutely amazed at how well these sound compared to Sony Pulse Earphones and Apple Air Pods Pro. The fact that it can play both your phone content (calls, streaming etc.) and your PS5 (games, media) at once is just a bonus!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are excellent gaming buds. They’re designed for gaming, so don’t expect earbuds with EQ options for listening to music. They sound great for gaming and I love the portability. They pair excellently with my Portal. They can also connect to both my Portal and my phone at the same time, which was a pleasant surprise.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These earbuds sound amazing while gaming. Sound is very sharp and rich. They work really well with the portal and PS5. When it comes to the phones the phone functions are super basic and it’s okay enough if you just plan to take a call from here or there or if you listen to podcasts. Music for some reason on the phone isnt as rich sounding lacking bass while vocals are really good. Microphone is passable tested on the PS5 and recorded a message there. Ear Tips are kind of flimsy would recommend getting different tips if possible. Overall I think there is something with the Planar Earbuds and I think overall definitely some of the best sounding ear buds for gaming.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect sound. My online friends say they can hear me perfectly without raising my voice. You may have to switch the earbud piece to fit your ears however, my ears were too big for the default.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall 4 out of 5. Good: Connectivity, multiple devices, basic battery life, easy to use. The box explains how to connect them to your device and even how to wear them easily. Quite comfortable, I recommend these for gamers who enjoy immersive sound without sound canceling (unfortunately). 5-6hrs of constant usage, to be honest I think this is great especially since you can just swap ears out or immerse yourself, take a 30 minute rest and get back to it Bad: Overlapping audios with multiple devices(double edged sword) as someone can call you and the game will be playing audio at the same time. Caution around pets as earpiece can be easily gnawed off', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easy to setup and use. Good sound quality. No discernible lag/delay compared to the over-ear Sony pulse headphones. Also easy to connect to multiple devices and combine sound between ps5 and second device. Not the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn, but work well enough and nice to finally have earbuds w/ microphone that can be used with the ps5. Feels a bit overpriced when you consider that they're more expensive than airpod pros."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love it , works well to my requirements, especially for my gaming. I think it’s classy and futuristic and appearance. I have a Beats fit pro and it’s Equally as comfortable. I feel just a little more smaller or thinner pocket fitted size case would be really cool but in all regards I love it to the point I will always use it and trust to pass it down to my kids if I have kids haha. Very satisfied with this portable earbuds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Fantastic ear buds, with lots of great features. They sound amazing and fit comfortably in your ears. They have a great charging case that mimics the PS5 look. Easily swap back and forth between PlayStation and any Bluetooth device. Great addition to the PS5 and PlayStation Portal.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Use these daily love these things and how easily they connext to each of my devices after the latest patch.

I am within 25 feet of my phone in the house and playback is choppy and cuts out. I go for a walk with my phone in my pocket and playback is choppy. The only good thing is that the battery life is good on the headphones and on the charger. The charger bottom is rounded so no way to stand up, which I miss as well from the earlier Indy’s. The rubber part that fits the headphones in your ear as well as used to pull them from the charger is sturdier than the last ones. All in all, I wish I could have gotten a new pair exactly like the Indy’s I had… these are not an upgrade.']"
"JVC - Nearphones Open-Ear Wireless Headphones with Charging Case, Black",$119.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jvc-nearphones-open-ear-wireless-headphones-with-charging-case-black/19194029/review,"['[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Let me get straight to the chase on these. These JVC Open-ear headphones are absolutely atrocios for anyone serious about the all around quality of their listening apporatus. I don\'t know what JVC was trying to achieve by bringing them to market, but I definitely know that it wasn\'t designed to impress anyone. First thing. Opening the box, you find and over-sized charging case that no one wants to be seen pulling out of their pocket. It literally gives off hearing-aid vibes. I believe this case has a larger footprint than that last iteration. I believe these are round 3 for the brand. you get what I may be a 4"" charging cable and the Near phones. After reading that, I thank you for wanting to know more. The comfort in these are near non-existent. They feel like they are going to fall off at any given second. Which is wierd, considering that they are designed to hoook around your ear securely. The buttons are unnecessarily over sensitive. That leads us to the sound quality. Since these don\'t enter the ear, you\'ll not get that humming bass of other earphones.(at least that is the escuse.) But the truth is, they just aren\'t secure enough to allow for any comfortable listening. I tryed these on my PC after such hot mess while using my phone, and I actually feel like I was punishig myself. For something that coul easily pass for a hearing-aid, it\'s a shame that you would need a hearing-aid to get any enjoyment from trying to wear them. Please pass these up.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was so happy to receive these JVC HA-NP40 nearphones in black with the open-ear styling. That is my all time favorite type of earbuds now. They arrived with an included USB-C to USB-C charging cable but no charger. Your charger must have a minimum of 2.5 watts to max of 10 watts per the instructions. I proceeded to charge them which didn't take long and as I mainly use them for making calls and listening to audiobooks I was excited to give them a try. There is some paperwork with a QR code to scan for the manual which I did. There is no app available but I wasn't bothered by that. One of the first things I noticed was the ear wrap has a pivot motion so you can adjust to fit your ears perfectly. I also like the fact that I can use one single earbud and when the battery depletes I still have the other one to use. These offer true wireless, 16mm large drivers sound, Bluetooth 5.4 and up to 26 hours battery life with charging case. They come in black, blue or green. They also have 3 sound modes ~ Normal, Bass, High and a touch sensor control. A female voice does alert you to various things like POWER ON ~ CONNECTED ~ POWER OFF, etc. That's part of the auto off/on connect feature and a microphone which is superb for hands free calls. When I used them straight talking they made it about 7 hours then I switched to the other one. Started charging the drained battery and in about 2 hours it was fully charged again. They are ever so comfortable and lightweight weighing about 0.28 ounces. I honestly forget I have them on! I found I can get about 30 feet away from my phone before the sound starts cutting out. I personally like the Normal setting. It's all around ideal for my various uses. The sound is crystal clear for myself as well as the listener on calls. I am so very pleased with that ~ no muffled noise or unpleasant racket. When listening to my audiobooks at night and I fall asleep then wake up they are still on my ears with absolutely no discomfort. Being a back sleeper these are fantastic for me. Not much else I can say except they are quite impressive and I have no CONS to note. Well made, great sound, easy to wear and well worth the purchase!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I\'ve found that over time I have purchased different headphones for different applications. These JVC headphones impressed me right away by how light they are, but that is abut the only way they are superior to my other headphones. The experience of wearing these is closer to wearing bone induction headphones instead of the other over-the-ear headphones I own. That\'s why they are called ""Nearphones."" And since the speaker is never in your ear, the listening experience is far from excellent. So the value of these headphones really depends on the application. The first time I took these to listen to an audiobook on a walk, I was very disappointed. I could not hear the audiobook at all when cars passed by. I concluded they are not made for exercise, even though someone could argue they are helpful to allow you to remain aware of activity around you. If I cannot hear the audiobook, I might as well not have them on. Where I did end up using them is in my quiet office taking calls or participating in video meetings. Given that, it is hard to comment on sound quality - these are certainly not for audiophiles.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using these headphones/nearphones for last 1 week and I like them. So, first thing first, in my opinion these are not fit for intense workouts like fast running etc as they kind of hang over your ear canal. My usage has been mostly indoor (for work calls and online meetings) and for some walks outside. And I like them precisely for the reason that they simple hang over which makes them more comfortable to wear for long periods of time as compared to other in-ear or over-ear headphones that I have tried. The battery life is pretty good. These last whole day for me and I only charge them in the night. The sound quality is good. Obviously it is not as immersive as in-ear or over-ear headphones but it is better than other bone conduction near phones that I have tried. The design is good so that even though you can hear the external environment noise/audio, others can't hear what you are listening to. So overall, they are a good fit for people who want to be aware of their surroundings while enjoying their music/podcasts etc. Their price point makes them pretty affordable as compared to other nearphonse available without compromising on the quality of audio."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really wanted to like these ear, headphones, but ultimately I just don’t like the way they fit. The set up is easy enough and pairing, there’s no problem with whatever device. Would be nice to be able to pair with multiple devices, but I was not able to get that to work. that in and of itself is not a dealbreaker. However, the design and fit of these over the ear ear headphones is a big problem for me. I have other over the ear headphones, and I have no problem with the way those fit. However, these JBL’s just doesn’t give you that confident feeling that the ear headphones are snuggling in your ear canal. They’re just not designed to fit that way and I get it, but they fit more like earrings and dangle more than they are snuggling inside your ear canal. Therefore, I think quality suffers as a result and never gets a proper seal and projection of the sound into your ear. Sure, when you first put it on it slips around your ear, and then you can rotate the body of the device to make it fit a little more securely, but it still does not give you a confident feel. Additionally, the touch controls are so overly sensitive that if you mess with the Device and try to get it to fit better you end up messing with the controls and Pausing your content or doing some unwanted control because the touch controls are poorly designed And located on the body of the headphone. The case is nice enough design and they charge well but ultimately I cannot use these for day-to-day use music, Phone calls or watching video.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] There seems to be a trend in the headphone industry to shake up the clip style headphones. Having used earbuds in place of dedicated single speaker headset, I can understand having long sessions of the earbuds and the fatigue it creates. Our ears are all different so, trying to get that perfect fit is sometimes hard and the earbud is either falling out or being pushed out if you can’t get that Goldilocks fitment. The ear clip design tries to mitigate this issue, but sometimes it just pairs the earbud with the clip so you may still get ear fatigue. The JVC Nearphone is like an on-the-hear headphone (speaker rests on the ear), but wireless and in clip format. The clip secures on the ear by rotating in the base and “clamping” (I use that extremely loosely) onto the ear. It does solve the issue of ear fatigue by earbud. These are extremely light and other clip style headphones I have tried creates a different kind of ear fatigue. These are so light though, gravity doesn’t really help them stick to the ear either. Use cases would be sitting in a coffee shop typing up a review and listening to music and wanting the ambient sounds to come through naturally. Light activity, I wouldn’t worry about them falling off, though they may “flop” about a bit. Looking at the advertisement images on JVC webpage…jogging and cycling are a no go for me. The Nearphones don’t fix the perfect for everyone issue existing with all earbuds and in my usage cases, those movements created too much movement for Nearphones and quell my irritation if they were going to stay on or fall off. What I Like: They are very light as is the case. Virtually no ear fatigue Simple to use, no app needed or required (does mean controls are locked) What I Don’t Like: Audio Quality Call Quality I really cannot comment on the battery life as I didn’t use for very long. My main goal was to see how they do as dedicated headset for calls, but whether one or both Nearphones were in operation, the caller on the end said there was just too much background noise. The cafe I was in had 3 people in and soft piano music playing, the air was running. Not what I would call loud background noise. Maybe all of it combined was too much for the mics to wash out. Audio quality I feel is just a result of the design, as an earbud will get into the ear canal, so there is going to be a loss of “feeling” the music and respectively the loudness at which you hear it. The sound experience is not rich or full, but useable. The caveat with these being very simple to use and not requiring an app, means no long-term support with firmware updates; so what you get is what you got. I feel like this style of headphone is very niche, so the recommendation has to be the same. Overall I feel like the Nearphone is a dual pack headset with Left and Right headsets that can be paired or used in single mode. If that appeals to your needs then they might do the trick. Bearing in mind, they are not the best at being a headset unless you are in a no-to-low ambient noise environment.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a hard product to review because it’s good at what it does, but it’s not good at what headphones usually should do. Let me explain. The idea of this style of headphones is so you can hear around you and not have that “plugged ear” feeling. When you talk or chew with these on, you won’t hear yourself in your head as if you had your ears plugged. And that is SUPER useful for certain situations. What these headphones do not do is provide full body sound at a high volume. And that’s going to make a lot of people rate them low despite the fact that they do still serve a purpose. I have been wanting a pair of headphones like this for awhile. There’s also bone conducting headphones, which I have not tried yet, but are also way more expensive but claim to do a similar result. However, for this lower price and my needs, I thought these JVC nearphones headphones would get the job done. And technically, I was right. I wanted this style for things like zoom calls, discord voice chats while gaming and even phone calls. I figured for the occasional music while working with or around others might also be useful but that didn’t work so well, and that’s where I had some not so good experiences, but more on that later. PROS: For voice chat type audio, these work fantastic. Since that was the main reason I wanted them, I’m happy with it. I can put these headphones on for a zoom chat and when I am talking, I don’t have that annoying plugged ear feeling where my voice is extra loud in my head making me talk quieter or not hear others. I can talk just like a normal phone call. However I could see issues with volume since these speakers are not in your ear, they are quieter and less full. In a noisy environment, it could be harder to clearly hear the voice on the other side. Overall though, I used these headphones in a controlled environment during multiple video chat calls and zoom calls on my PC and had no issues with connection or hearing the other people. I was using a pro audio mic at my computer and not the mic on the headphones, but when I tested the headphone mic, people said they could hear me fine. CONS: The first thing I’ll mention is the fit because it probably has a lot to do with the rest of my issues. The instructions from JVC that come with the nearphones headphones show how to put them on and how they should look/fit when in the correct spot. There is a picture of how they shouldn’t fit but that’s the only way I could get them to stay put. So how the manual says is wrong is how I was forced to wear them. I guess to be fair, I was more in the middle of the two pictures, not quite correct, not quite wrong. I do have smaller ears so maybe that’s some of it, but the issue was the headphones kept pushing themselves away from my ear instead of moving inward toward the ear hole like the manual says they should. I rotated them back and forth and tried forcing them into place, but they would always settle into this hybrid style fit that was loose but worked good enough. I felt like they would fall off, but I jumped around a lot and couldn’t get them to actually fall off. So they fit good enough for what I wanted them to do, but I also noticed if I pushed them in closer to my ears they would be louder and fuller sound. So you may have different experiences based on the ear shape. But because of the fit I had two major issues. Quality and volume. By far the biggest con of these headphones is the audio quality. If you want crystal clear, full range music from headphones that float over your ear, you’re gonna be searching for a long time. Those of you old enough to remember the old style of headphones that came with every walkman or discman will know what I’m talking about when I say it sounds like those old style headphones when you would put them slightly in front or off your ears a little. You still hear the music but 90% of the low end is gone and it’s very tinny. Now, you can adjust this a bit with EQ but you’re not going to recover the lows. It’s just not how this style works. I do wish JVC was a little more upfront about that instead of claiming to still have full range clear sound, it would only help their marketing if they were more honest, but if you’re skeptical about how these sound, you’re probably right. Again, for voice, it doesn’t matter and it works great, but once you play music you’ll notice a lack of quality. It works for low volume background noise while still wanting to be present in the room, but you’re not gonna toss these puppies on and kick back in your chair to dissect some classical tunes. The other glaring issue is the lack of volume. Again, to reference those 90s headphones we all had that sat over our ears, if you didn’t have them lined up perfect with your ears, the volume would drop off dramatically. These are the same way. They’re designed to sit over your ear opening, but like I mentioned about the fit, they don’t really sit right for me and because of that gap, I lose a lot of quality and volume. There is a chance MAYBE they fit better on others, like I mentioned, the instructions seem to show a different fit than I can get, so maybe that’s part of the volume issue too, but generally speaking, for my fit, I had to turn everything up to full volume just to get an average level. If I pushed the headphones in closer to my ears, it was better, but they would not stay there. OVERALL So like I said, I still really like these headphones if you use them in ways that benefit from their unique design. Many of us are on virtual calls more than ever these days and having a headphone that allows you to hear the room around you and the people in the call is something you just cannot get with new standard in-ear headphones. People opt to not use headphones at all making calls harder to hear with ducking every few seconds. These headphones allow for clearer calls without that annoying plugged ear sound when you talk. I think if these were marketed as video call headphones they would fly off the shelf. Everyone should have a pair of these at their work or gaming computer.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I appreciate the return to the clip-on style headphone. I've always had problems with in-ears falling out, and you don't always want to wear over-ear or on-ear style headphones. These remind me of the wired headphones I had about 10 years ago. That being said, the audio quality also reminds me of the inexpensive wired headphones I had 10 years ago. The bass is rather minimal, but these will be good if you're looking for inexpensive headphones to run and still be able to hear (way less expensive than bone-conducting headphones). Otherwise, they'll be good for podcasts or lighter music. As a headset for making phone calls, these are terrible. I needed to turn the volume to max just to be able to hear the person on the other end even when I was in a quiet room. The person on the other end could barely hear me and described the audio as being at the far end of a long metal tube. So, audio quality on calls (on both ends) is terrible. The battery life is accurately reported. This is something that JVC reports accurately."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I didn’t like these. It did not fit snug on my ear, even after attempting to adjust it several times. The volume is very low and I did not like the quality. It does not sit in your ear. It sits on top of your ear, which makes it very difficult to hear.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really wasn't sure what to think of these headphones. I had never worn nor heard of a near ear headphone. But I can say I'm very surprised how much I live them. Now these aren't by any means hi fidelity so if that's what you should look somewhere else. But where these do shine is comfort and the ability to stay connected to the world around you while listening to a podcast or music. The sound quality is actually pretty good. Like I said it's not hi Fi. But I've worn them in public, while mowing and at the gym and could still hear everything I was listening too and still was able to hear everything around me too. It was a unique feeling that I really liked. Comfort wise these are incredible. Since nothing is poking in my ear I could wear them all day with no discomfort at all. I loved this, though people did feel weird talking to me with them on my head. Battery life is great, I was able to listen off and on all day for a few days and just charge the case every other day. Overall these are incredible if you want a good sounding, comfortable headphone that lasts all day and let's you still hear what's going on around you.""]"

The left cup has a volume control and microphone. The cushions are comfortable but not too bulky. I tested the headphones on Zoom, Google Meet and Facebook Messenger and are all compatible. Now that we are allowed to work remote full time, these video conferencing tools have become so essential.', ""I bought it yesterday. It's so nice, I love it. I also installed JBL QuantumENGINE app on my PC, it's great. Good sound, looong cable, high quality microphone. USB adapter is very useful. My PC has two 3-pin connectors but headset has 4-pin connector, so USB adapter is my salvation."", ""Bought the headset a little over a year ago. There is a systemic problem with this JBL line of headphones where the swivel point for the hear pieces will crack (see photo). This happened a little over 4 months into its use. We sent them back for repairs and they were replaced. Same thing happened to the replacement headphones as well as the 200's that were also purchased. Since they were no longer under warranty I repaired them using epoxy and fibreglass, so they no longer swivel, but they will not fall apart any further now. Now at the end of a year with them the mini jack has cracked and it no longer works with the mic."", 'I bought this headset a few months ago and they were great. Zero complaints about the function, however they are sooo prone to breaking at the point where the ear pieces meet the headband. At these points the speakers swivel and through the attachment that swivels, there are cables running through. About a month in, I notices a couple pieces about the size of a grain of sand were missing. 2.5 months in while wearing the headset, a large piece popped off, landing on my keyboard, and the headphone was swinging free. At that point I could clearly see how overly prone to failure that point was. The plastic is very brittle, and surprisingly thin.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been a fan of the JBL sound for decades and for my simple gaming and SKYPE, these fill a need at a reasonable price. The quality of sound is truly geared for gaming not-so-much for music. A touch bass heavy and mid-range voice boost. Attributes for gaming. The sound with music is OK, but there are better options if music is the primary purpose. Reasonably comfortable. Seals sound from the outside very well. No noticeable distortion. Competitive within the suggested price range. Recommended', ""Decent sound and mic quality. Was good when I first bought it but 2 months after purchase, the joints on the frame on both sides have broken. Won't even stay on my head anymore and because the wiring goes through the joint, the left side sound cuts out and mic intermittently doesn't work.

Good stereo sound, and team mates could hear me very well! Much better than the free headset earplugs that come with a new cell phone. Trouble is, once too many times picking up to use it. The hinge on one of the ear cups just gave up, no use trying to tape it back together or anything. Again, to be fair, it got a lot of use over the last year and a half! I'll buy one again, and I wish I could keep using this one."", 'When purchasing a pair of gaming headphones I was expecting something that can take some heavy use and is comfortable. The JBL headphones only fill one of those boxes. The cushioning for the ears and head are excellent but the durability was not up to par. After having this headset for just over a year, the swivel part that connects the speaker to the headrest broke. So the best solution was to tape it and hope for the best. It lasted another couple months before the right speaker stopped working. Other than the build quality, the microphone had crisp, clear audio and the speakers weren’t distorted and had great stereo sound. I did like that the cord was covered in a mesh.']"

Generally Audio-Technica is a company I trust. I've been using their ATH-M50X headphones for years. Best sound profile I've ever heard out of a pair of headphones.

The Bluetooth sucks, plain and simple. It is infuriating when seemingly out of nowhere one of the earbuds will just disconnect for no reason whatsoever, or only one will connect after removing them from the case so you'll have to repeat the process of putting them back in the case and removing them again until they both pair. 40$ skull candy headphones have better Bluetooth."", 'Effective noise cancellation: The noise cancellation feature works satisfactorily, isolating external noises and allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your music. What to consider: Weight: Some users have mentioned that the headphones can feel a little heavy on the ears after prolonged use. This may be a factor to consider if you are looking for extremely lightweight headphones. Fit: While most users find the headphones fit comfortably, you may need to experiment with the different included ear tips to find the perfect fit.', 'Pros: - Heavy bass, as if you are wearing headphones. - 12 hour battery. Cons: - Worst software I\'ve ever seen. Taking them out of the case won\'t automatically connect it to your device. Worse even, holding the multifunction buttons won\'t turn them on like they\'re supposed to. You need to put them back in the case and take it out again to reset the whole thing (according to the manual, this is the equivalent to turning it on and off again since there\'s no actual ""reset"" function unlike other earbuds) - Right earbud broke within 6 months, to have them repair it requires me to cover the $20 shipping to the US just to have it checked. - Sound quality is mediocre, like $20 earbud bad. - Extremely large, sticks out of your ears. - Notoriously poor fit for people from my research, but worked for me. Only slight discomfort after prolonged use. - IPX2, second lowest water resistance rating. Be afraid to take these out in the rain.', 'I bought these brand new. I only feel comfortable wearing wireless in-ear headphones for all my private music/podcast listening. I will not settle for just any ""gets the job done"" pair of headphones. THESE are 100 % better than the Sennheiser ones (yes I tried them first because I own over-ear Sennheiser headphones that I love, and I know Sennheiser puts priority on sound quality - they were trash). These offer louder max volume setting, have more bass, and longer battery life than any other headphones I\'ve tried for this price. Some say you have to put the ear bud in and out of the case if you are having sync issues-I\'ve had that issue with the older model but these have yet to fail at an immediate connection to my phone or laptop. It is impossible not to get hyped when you put these on with your favourite playlist. I can\'t recommend these enough.

No noise cancelling at all. After about 5 days of rocking this piece of engineering, I would say the cushions (the mounting of the bud into the ear) are the problem!!!

Bravo Sony!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received the Sony Linkbuds from Sony to review. They had no control over or input with this review. I was really excited about these headphones when I read about them online a couple weeks ago and was ready to drop the $180 for them on release since I work in a supervisory position in my job and constantly have people talking to me but also wanted to have my music playing when things slowed down. I have noise cancelling earbuds but the transparency function sounds like I have a seashell up to my ear everyday and I don\'t like it. So these, as they were intended, are perfect for my day to day life. Pros: - The design is cool, the chrome hole reminds me of those expensive Apple wheels for the Mac Desktop. And the white color has speckles that looks nice. - Setup and connecting to phone is pretty simple. Need to download Sony Headphones app to take full advantage of all the functions and features. - Large tap area to perform the designated functions on both buds. Can be customized in the app. - Sounds decent, won\'t blow you away but are good enough for their intended purpose. Cons: - Case doesn\'t charge wirelessly - Battery life is a bit disappointing as you\'ll need to charge them during the day. - Getting them in the ear takes some practice and time to get right. - The ring part that sits in the ear isn\'t adjustable so if you have small ears, they will hurt during/after extended use and the lockdown ""wingtips"" help but can also cause pain. So I\'d like to see more adjustable fit options for a more comfortable fit in the next iteration of the LinkBuds.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Only had the Linkbuds for a week, but so far I really enjoying them. I was a bit skeptical with the doughnut style design if I’m honest, but I’m actually preferring them over my in ear buds I normally use. They are very unique and……different, but in a strangely good way. The biggest thing for me is ear fatigue, if that’s even a thing. It happens to me from wearing them for extended periods of time. I find that the links are very comfy in that regard. I tried out a few of the adjusters but the ones that are on as standard ended up being ideal for my ear shape. I barely feel these sitting in my ear, so I get the ‘every day’ aspect. The design is unique, the case is very small and compact, which it needs to be. The links are tiny yet feel strong and sturdy. Sound quality is good and on par with most other buds. It’s clear and punchy if you adjust the equaliser through the Sony Headphones app, which in itself is a really good feature. I especially like the 360° audio which gives the impression you’re in the same room with sound coming from all angles in front and behind. It links seamlessly with my mobile and other devices. One thing I didn’t think I would use as much as I am is the voice integration. Alexa is my go to just now!! The tap gestures to play, pause, skip etc are a nice touch. Modern technology at its best really. Battery duration has been very good and the case keeps them going for longer. I’ve yet to really test the quick charge, but that will come. One thing I’ve only briefly tried out is the Microsoft Soundscape collaboration. It’s a really cool feature and I’m looking forward to testing them out as I wander around my city and when visiting others. Honestly give it a try for yourself to see what I mean. There’s plenty of guides in the packaging which I believe is made with all recycled materials, as are the Linkbuds I think. If pocket guides aren’t your thing, quick scan of the QR code and your off. Simple. Surprising little things with big ambitions! My new go to earbuds!', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These LinkBuds Truly Wireless Earbuds by Sony have been great so far. To start, they have their own app which is easy to use and see the health status of my earbuds when needed. It shows the battery level of both the earbuds as the case. I use the earbuds for an hour or so a day and it gets me through most of the week before I need to think about charging the case again. The earbuds use battery life while being used and the case charges them up again so they are ready for the next use. The earbuds fit well in my ear and I don’t feel like they are going to slip out of my ears like other wireless brands I have had. The set up with the silicone band helps keep the earbud in place with minimal movement. There are multiple sizes that come with the earbuds to make sure you have a good fit. The sound of the earbuds is clear and good quality. I’ve used them for phone calls as well and the sound is also clear. The person on the other end can hear me easily as well. When the earbuds detect me talking and I’m listening to a podcast they pause on their own which I really like. Once I’m finished talking, I can tap the earbuds to resume the podcast. One of the things I have some issue with is that the design of the earbuds and hearing outside sounds and wind. While I love that they are open in the middle and feel that this promotes a cleaner earbud that doesn’t pick up crud from my ear, it also interferes with the sound. Because there is some open space in the earbud when it is windy, I can hear the wind and it lowers what I can hear. If there are load noises around me, again the sound coming from the earbuds is harder to hear. I also wish the earbuds came with a longer charging cord. I don’t have a charging station and all of my outlets are high enough on the wall that the cord dangles with the earbuds attached while charging. I wish the case could rest on the counter and not be supported by the charging cable. While I am not a fan no noise cancellation and a short cord, these earbuds are a great option if you are looking for a new pair that’s easy to use, has good sounds quality and a good battery life.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So these were very intriguing when I seen the announcement stream; the hole in the middle to allow sound in for a safer listening experience had me intrigued about sound bleed where those noises would interfere with the listening experience. Also I was excited as these were the first ‘in-ear’ earphones, which don’t actually go inside the ear canal - I suffer with ear infections and so can’t really use earphones, because they make them worse or cause an infection as the ear canal can’t ‘breathe.’ These provided hope of a solution. I want to personally thank Sony for these earphones, as I actually have a pair of ‘in-ear’ earphones I can use, as these allow me to experience wonderful sound quality and the convenience and portability of earphones, thanks to them not actually entering the ear canal. I am also delighted to say that Sony has worked some scientific magic with these earphones: sound quality is wonderful; voice isolation is fantastic and call quality is amongst the best I’ve had reported by one friend who is a particular pain about call quality. Now don’t misunderstand me, the sound quality is wonderful, but it doesn’t replace the dynamic range and quality of high-end headphones such as the Sony WH-1000XM4 or in-ear high-end earphones such as WF-1000XM4 - but it comes extraordinarily close! But if you’re expecting that, you’re missing the point of these earphones; the sound quality is good enough and so well balanced that you can listen to literally any genre (I tried every genre I could find) using a range of streaming services, set to highest quality - taking advantage of Sony’s proprietary DSEE wireless standard - and you lose very little detail in sound, a little bit of punch from the bass - though notably not much and these earphones are so light, comfortable and do their job so well, that for casual listening and/or phone calls, and especially price range, you can’t beat these in my opinion. Oh and I felt this deserved its own little section, the pairing process is completely seamless and very, very similar to a competitors set of earphones connection process. You open the case and remove the earphones from the case near to an Android smartphone, and it will pop-up and say ‘Connect’ tap connect and that’s it, you’re done. There is a manual connection button on the case to connect to the iPhone; both work well, but you will get the best experience on Android thanks to the DSEE transfer protocol and the connection process. Also the use of recycled plastic and keeping the footprint as low as possible is something that shouldn’t be overlooked, but rather championed. They’re not perfect, there is definitely a technique to placing them on the ear lobe correctly to ensure optimum sonic performance and for them to remain secure ‘in’ the ear. However once you do place them correctly you get long battery life; wonderful sound quality; great call quality and access to all the features one would expect in a higher-end pair of earphones. If you’re an audiophile who gets easily annoyed at less than perfectly punchy lows and full sonic dynamic range, then you wouldn’t be looking to use these anyway, as you already know the importance of a multitude of factors which make earphones incredibly difficult to give you a ‘perfect’ audio experience - though I stress that the compromises here are small and should only affect the most die-hard audiophiles. But for the vast majority of people and audiophiles who are willing to forgive the minor drop in dynamic range and slightly less punchy lows for the portability and comfort; these are a no-brainer option. I tested movie playback, across all genres; podcasts; lectures and music across all genres and found the sound quality to be exemplary, especially for their size, weight and comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I personally think that True Wireless Earbuds have been one of the best personal tech advances in the last handful of years. They provide so much functionality all while barely even noticing they are there. The new Sony LinkBuds take a risk by providing something totally different than other True Wireless Earbuds and I think they totally delivered. UNBOXING / SETUP: - The unboxing was quite easy as Sony did a minimal packaging job which I can really appreciate. - But once you opened it, I was really amazed at how small the case was and the earbuds are. And I say that in a positive way because everything about it seems very discrete which I love. - I’d also love the “white” color although I’d say its more of a speckled gray, which I think look fantastic. - I used the Sony Headphones app to help with setup and it was super easy! You don’t need the Sony Headphones app to use these, but its must have if you want to do software upgrades, voice assistants, and various settings like EQ. - Lastly, I’d add that I did need to charge mine a bit before I could use them because they were not at 100% out of the box which is the case with pretty much any battery operated headphones. PROS: - The concept behind these “hole” shaped buds are that they allow exterior sound in while still allowing you to listen to music, taking calls, etc. I personally felt that aspect was fantastic and I really enjoyed them! More often than not, I need to hear what’s going on around me rather than silence off the world around me so I thought they did a great job of allowing you to use the earbuds while still be aware of your surroundings. - That being said, the sound quality is fantastic! I was truly happy with how full the sound felt and how clear the audio was in my ears, even with the open ear design. I used the Sony Headphones app to change the EQ to add more bass and I was happy with how easy it was to change that! - The LinkBuds can get really loud too which is impressive for how small they are. So even with the open ear design, you could still drown out the background with the volume easily. - Like I said above, these things are so small and so discrete in your ears which I really love. I wore them while running errands, putting stocking caps on/off, taking sweatshirts on/off and these earbuds never fell out once. I was quite happy with how they rested in my ear and did not get caught on anything. - I also wore these while working out and on runs / walks. I had no issues with them falling out or moving around too much and was very pleased with how they worked! - Phone calls are probably where these earbuds shine the brightest. When testing these on calls, the LinkBuds do an excellent jump ignoring background noise and focusing just on your voice. My voice came across as clear and with the open ear design, I can hear how loud I am talking which is a plus since noise cancelling buds tend to make me not know how loud I am talking. COOL NEW FEATURE: - I wanted to specifically call out the coolest thing about these earbuds which are, the touch controls. - Instead of touching the earbuds to play/pause, answer calls, change songs.. you touch the area on the side of your head right next to your ear. - This feature has worked so so well for me and I could not be more impressed! I just think moves like this really push earbuds to be more creative and make tech better. - Also I like how I never have to touch the earbuds since I already want to make sure they are resting in my ears right and not move them around. - Lastly, these charge via USB-C which is great as USB-C is becoming the new standard for every device. CONS: - The biggest downside to me is no wireless charging and batter life. The earbuds only last about 5.5 hours on one charge which is fine but I really wish they should be more like 8 hours. On top of that, when I do need a quick charge I can not do it on a wireless charger. - Although these fit well in my ears, I think the fit might not be comfortable for some. There is no padding on them so it’s really just the plastic buds just sitting wedged in your ears. - Lastly, although the case is small and nice looking, it just does not have a premium feel to it. BOTTOM LINE: - The Sony LinkBuds are a unique take on the wireless earbuds. Their hole shaped design, open ear flow, and sound delivery are something you do not find in most buds! But I think that they provide great sound quality of music, are fantastic for taking calls, and will be very welcomed by people who are out running / walking or in public and want to hear their surroundings. The LinkBuds provide people with a fresh take on wireless earbuds and they deliver!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Few consumer electronics devices emote personal preference as earbuds. This is a category where variety is essential. I personally have two requirements when choosing an earbud for general use: - It can't create a seal in my ear - I hate that pressure - It has to be secure - if it feels like it's going to pop out I find myself fixated on the bud I also have a couple nice to haves: - I want something that is small. The case has to fit in my pocket and I don't need something big sticking out of my ear - I tend not to like ear hooks - I find that my ears ache after a few hours. It would appear that these Sony Link Buds were made for someone like me! Unboxing: I'll just never understand why more manufacturers don't take a simpler approach. The box was small and compact, and the cardboard quality was stout, but it took way too much effort to get through the outer layer, open the box, dig through the smaller boxes containing the instructions and USB-C cable. First Impressions: Man these are tiny! The case itself left a little to be desired. The top cover that flips up felt flimsy and I don't like that it latches with a push button. A couple of well placed magnets would have been more satisfying and offered a premium feel. The quality of the buds though is impressive! Inserting into the ear: I was nervous at first that these would be difficult to insert. After a couple of tries I found what works best for me. I insert the rubber ring supporter into the inside of my ear arch first then slide the bud into my ear canal. This allows me to use a larger ring which makes the fit nice and secure. Pairing: If I were to give this particular aspect a star rating it's definitely a 3-star. Sony advocates that you download a separate headphone app for full controls and customization. I have enough apps on my phone - I just want my headphones to work. It's not that pairing was difficult - it just reminded me of how I used to pair bluetooth 5 years ago. Another HUGE downside is that I had to pair separately on my iPhone and my iPad. I'm not sure if the license is available for Sony to sync devices automatically with others on the same iCloud account - but if it's allowed - they should make it a priority. Comfort & Fit: I'm in love. I wore them last night for 4 hours and again this morning while working out and cleaning around the house. No ear fatigue and I never felt like they were going to fall out. The big test was eating my breakfast bagel - other earbuds I've tried would loosen when chewing. The Sony Link Buds stayed in place like a champ! Pleasantly surprised with how comfortable they are! Sound Quality: Let's be practical here - if they're this comfortable they aren't going to sound as good as something with a complete seal. I'm OK with that. Go in with the right expectations and you'll be fine. Working out with the same playlist I normally use I found that the music sounded a little flatter than I'm used to - lack of punch if that makes sense. Others may mention bass but I think it's a little more than simply frequencies not heard. Detail is good - separation is great. Sound is not muddy. Very clean sound. Volume is not an issue. Just not a lot of oomph. Open Ring Driver: The selling point from Sony is the open ring driver allows ambient noise to sound natural. This is an area I would give 6-stars if I could! When not listening to music I can hear everything at let's say 90% of what I could if I wasn't wearing anything at all. It's the type of feature that would allow me to wear these all day long. If I'm working I like to have instrumental music playing sometimes, but I get up to walk around my house to do something I would always take my earbuds out. With the Link Buds I find myself leaving them in because they're comfortable and I can still hear. It's weird to put in a coffee pod and not hear the lid close - with the Link Buds I hear everything! That said - don't expect to carry on a conversation with music playing. At the end of the day there's still a tiny driver in your ear and it's going to fill your ears with sound. Final Thoughts: These Link Buds are nearly perfect. For Me. For a work-from-home, multi-use, comfort focused user these are great! If you're in a noisy office and want to melt away into your work - these might be a pass. If you're a jet-setter and want something to block out engine noise - these are definitely a pass. If you're on a train frequently? I might consider these - you definitely want to be aware of your surroundings so the open ring might be appropriate. Thanks Sony for taking the risk to be different and for delivering a great product!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had no clue how these would fit in my ear or stay in my ear, but they do! And they are comfortable! There are other little plastic pieces for comfortability and fit, but the standard ones already on the linkbuds we’re perfect for me. There are times where I’ve forgotten that they were even in my ears. The bass levels aren’t where you’d want them to be if you love bass, but that’s okay with me. One other perk that I love is that me and my wife can watch a show together on my phone without needing our heads so close to each other, like we would with wired headphones. Definitely an innovative step in a great direction!']"

The sound quality is inconsistent; sometimes it’s clear, but other times it gets interrupted, making it frustrating to use during calls or while listening to music.

For the price, I expected much better performance. I wouldn’t recommend these earbuds. Also, they tend to fall out of the ears while running, which is highly inconvenient.', ""The sun quality of the earphone is very good. I love the fact that you can slide the side of the earphone to increase the volume and you can press the bottom of it to pause and play Media. The only things I don't like about it are the design of the earphone and the battery life. Inserting the earphone into charging case and sometimes be a hassle because of the shape. A round shaped stem would have been better. Also the case of the earphone should be able to have more battery capacity especially with how heavy the case is."", ""I upgraded from the first gen Galaxy Buds since there was a deal with my new phone to purchase the new Galaxy Buds3. They are not meant for smaller ears, so most women and youth will not be able to wear them. They slip right out of my ear while I talk, or move to pick something up, etc. I won't even try to exercise with them in because they'd fall out immediately. I've adjusted them to sit in different directions, but then the sound is altered. Definitely recommend for men, or if your outer ear is large.""]"

While I am not a fan no noise cancellation and a short cord, these earbuds are a great option if you are looking for a new pair that’s easy to use, has good sounds quality and a good battery life.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So these were very intriguing when I seen the announcement stream; the hole in the middle to allow sound in for a safer listening experience had me intrigued about sound bleed where those noises would interfere with the listening experience. Also I was excited as these were the first ‘in-ear’ earphones, which don’t actually go inside the ear canal - I suffer with ear infections and so can’t really use earphones, because they make them worse or cause an infection as the ear canal can’t ‘breathe.’ These provided hope of a solution. I want to personally thank Sony for these earphones, as I actually have a pair of ‘in-ear’ earphones I can use, as these allow me to experience wonderful sound quality and the convenience and portability of earphones, thanks to them not actually entering the ear canal. I am also delighted to say that Sony has worked some scientific magic with these earphones: sound quality is wonderful; voice isolation is fantastic and call quality is amongst the best I’ve had reported by one friend who is a particular pain about call quality. Now don’t misunderstand me, the sound quality is wonderful, but it doesn’t replace the dynamic range and quality of high-end headphones such as the Sony WH-1000XM4 or in-ear high-end earphones such as WF-1000XM4 - but it comes extraordinarily close! But if you’re expecting that, you’re missing the point of these earphones; the sound quality is good enough and so well balanced that you can listen to literally any genre (I tried every genre I could find) using a range of streaming services, set to highest quality - taking advantage of Sony’s proprietary DSEE wireless standard - and you lose very little detail in sound, a little bit of punch from the bass - though notably not much and these earphones are so light, comfortable and do their job so well, that for casual listening and/or phone calls, and especially price range, you can’t beat these in my opinion. Oh and I felt this deserved its own little section, the pairing process is completely seamless and very, very similar to a competitors set of earphones connection process. You open the case and remove the earphones from the case near to an Android smartphone, and it will pop-up and say ‘Connect’ tap connect and that’s it, you’re done. There is a manual connection button on the case to connect to the iPhone; both work well, but you will get the best experience on Android thanks to the DSEE transfer protocol and the connection process. Also the use of recycled plastic and keeping the footprint as low as possible is something that shouldn’t be overlooked, but rather championed. They’re not perfect, there is definitely a technique to placing them on the ear lobe correctly to ensure optimum sonic performance and for them to remain secure ‘in’ the ear. However once you do place them correctly you get long battery life; wonderful sound quality; great call quality and access to all the features one would expect in a higher-end pair of earphones. If you’re an audiophile who gets easily annoyed at less than perfectly punchy lows and full sonic dynamic range, then you wouldn’t be looking to use these anyway, as you already know the importance of a multitude of factors which make earphones incredibly difficult to give you a ‘perfect’ audio experience - though I stress that the compromises here are small and should only affect the most die-hard audiophiles. But for the vast majority of people and audiophiles who are willing to forgive the minor drop in dynamic range and slightly less punchy lows for the portability and comfort; these are a no-brainer option. I tested movie playback, across all genres; podcasts; lectures and music across all genres and found the sound quality to be exemplary, especially for their size, weight and comfort.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I personally think that True Wireless Earbuds have been one of the best personal tech advances in the last handful of years. They provide so much functionality all while barely even noticing they are there. The new Sony LinkBuds take a risk by providing something totally different than other True Wireless Earbuds and I think they totally delivered. UNBOXING / SETUP: - The unboxing was quite easy as Sony did a minimal packaging job which I can really appreciate. - But once you opened it, I was really amazed at how small the case was and the earbuds are. And I say that in a positive way because everything about it seems very discrete which I love. - I’d also love the “white” color although I’d say its more of a speckled gray, which I think look fantastic. - I used the Sony Headphones app to help with setup and it was super easy! You don’t need the Sony Headphones app to use these, but its must have if you want to do software upgrades, voice assistants, and various settings like EQ. - Lastly, I’d add that I did need to charge mine a bit before I could use them because they were not at 100% out of the box which is the case with pretty much any battery operated headphones. PROS: - The concept behind these “hole” shaped buds are that they allow exterior sound in while still allowing you to listen to music, taking calls, etc. I personally felt that aspect was fantastic and I really enjoyed them! More often than not, I need to hear what’s going on around me rather than silence off the world around me so I thought they did a great job of allowing you to use the earbuds while still be aware of your surroundings. - That being said, the sound quality is fantastic! I was truly happy with how full the sound felt and how clear the audio was in my ears, even with the open ear design. I used the Sony Headphones app to change the EQ to add more bass and I was happy with how easy it was to change that! - The LinkBuds can get really loud too which is impressive for how small they are. So even with the open ear design, you could still drown out the background with the volume easily. - Like I said above, these things are so small and so discrete in your ears which I really love. I wore them while running errands, putting stocking caps on/off, taking sweatshirts on/off and these earbuds never fell out once. I was quite happy with how they rested in my ear and did not get caught on anything. - I also wore these while working out and on runs / walks. I had no issues with them falling out or moving around too much and was very pleased with how they worked! - Phone calls are probably where these earbuds shine the brightest. When testing these on calls, the LinkBuds do an excellent jump ignoring background noise and focusing just on your voice. My voice came across as clear and with the open ear design, I can hear how loud I am talking which is a plus since noise cancelling buds tend to make me not know how loud I am talking. COOL NEW FEATURE: - I wanted to specifically call out the coolest thing about these earbuds which are, the touch controls. - Instead of touching the earbuds to play/pause, answer calls, change songs.. you touch the area on the side of your head right next to your ear. - This feature has worked so so well for me and I could not be more impressed! I just think moves like this really push earbuds to be more creative and make tech better. - Also I like how I never have to touch the earbuds since I already want to make sure they are resting in my ears right and not move them around. - Lastly, these charge via USB-C which is great as USB-C is becoming the new standard for every device. CONS: - The biggest downside to me is no wireless charging and batter life. The earbuds only last about 5.5 hours on one charge which is fine but I really wish they should be more like 8 hours. On top of that, when I do need a quick charge I can not do it on a wireless charger. - Although these fit well in my ears, I think the fit might not be comfortable for some. There is no padding on them so it’s really just the plastic buds just sitting wedged in your ears. - Lastly, although the case is small and nice looking, it just does not have a premium feel to it. BOTTOM LINE: - The Sony LinkBuds are a unique take on the wireless earbuds. Their hole shaped design, open ear flow, and sound delivery are something you do not find in most buds! But I think that they provide great sound quality of music, are fantastic for taking calls, and will be very welcomed by people who are out running / walking or in public and want to hear their surroundings. The LinkBuds provide people with a fresh take on wireless earbuds and they deliver!', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Few consumer electronics devices emote personal preference as earbuds. This is a category where variety is essential. I personally have two requirements when choosing an earbud for general use: - It can't create a seal in my ear - I hate that pressure - It has to be secure - if it feels like it's going to pop out I find myself fixated on the bud I also have a couple nice to haves: - I want something that is small. The case has to fit in my pocket and I don't need something big sticking out of my ear - I tend not to like ear hooks - I find that my ears ache after a few hours. It would appear that these Sony Link Buds were made for someone like me! Unboxing: I'll just never understand why more manufacturers don't take a simpler approach. The box was small and compact, and the cardboard quality was stout, but it took way too much effort to get through the outer layer, open the box, dig through the smaller boxes containing the instructions and USB-C cable. First Impressions: Man these are tiny! The case itself left a little to be desired. The top cover that flips up felt flimsy and I don't like that it latches with a push button. A couple of well placed magnets would have been more satisfying and offered a premium feel. The quality of the buds though is impressive! Inserting into the ear: I was nervous at first that these would be difficult to insert. After a couple of tries I found what works best for me. I insert the rubber ring supporter into the inside of my ear arch first then slide the bud into my ear canal. This allows me to use a larger ring which makes the fit nice and secure. Pairing: If I were to give this particular aspect a star rating it's definitely a 3-star. Sony advocates that you download a separate headphone app for full controls and customization. I have enough apps on my phone - I just want my headphones to work. It's not that pairing was difficult - it just reminded me of how I used to pair bluetooth 5 years ago. Another HUGE downside is that I had to pair separately on my iPhone and my iPad. I'm not sure if the license is available for Sony to sync devices automatically with others on the same iCloud account - but if it's allowed - they should make it a priority. Comfort & Fit: I'm in love. I wore them last night for 4 hours and again this morning while working out and cleaning around the house. No ear fatigue and I never felt like they were going to fall out. The big test was eating my breakfast bagel - other earbuds I've tried would loosen when chewing. The Sony Link Buds stayed in place like a champ! Pleasantly surprised with how comfortable they are! Sound Quality: Let's be practical here - if they're this comfortable they aren't going to sound as good as something with a complete seal. I'm OK with that. Go in with the right expectations and you'll be fine. Working out with the same playlist I normally use I found that the music sounded a little flatter than I'm used to - lack of punch if that makes sense. Others may mention bass but I think it's a little more than simply frequencies not heard. Detail is good - separation is great. Sound is not muddy. Very clean sound. Volume is not an issue. Just not a lot of oomph. Open Ring Driver: The selling point from Sony is the open ring driver allows ambient noise to sound natural. This is an area I would give 6-stars if I could! When not listening to music I can hear everything at let's say 90% of what I could if I wasn't wearing anything at all. It's the type of feature that would allow me to wear these all day long. If I'm working I like to have instrumental music playing sometimes, but I get up to walk around my house to do something I would always take my earbuds out. With the Link Buds I find myself leaving them in because they're comfortable and I can still hear. It's weird to put in a coffee pod and not hear the lid close - with the Link Buds I hear everything! That said - don't expect to carry on a conversation with music playing. At the end of the day there's still a tiny driver in your ear and it's going to fill your ears with sound. Final Thoughts: These Link Buds are nearly perfect. For Me. For a work-from-home, multi-use, comfort focused user these are great! If you're in a noisy office and want to melt away into your work - these might be a pass. If you're a jet-setter and want something to block out engine noise - these are definitely a pass. If you're on a train frequently? I might consider these - you definitely want to be aware of your surroundings so the open ring might be appropriate. Thanks Sony for taking the risk to be different and for delivering a great product!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had no clue how these would fit in my ear or stay in my ear, but they do! And they are comfortable! There are other little plastic pieces for comfortability and fit, but the standard ones already on the linkbuds we’re perfect for me. There are times where I’ve forgotten that they were even in my ears. The bass levels aren’t where you’d want them to be if you love bass, but that’s okay with me. One other perk that I love is that me and my wife can watch a show together on my phone without needing our heads so close to each other, like we would with wired headphones. Definitely an innovative step in a great direction!']"
Samsung Galaxy Buds3 In-Ear Noise Cancelling True Wireless Earbuds - Silver,$149.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/samsung-galaxy-buds3-in-ear-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-silver/17984586/review,"[""I am a HUGE fan of the Galaxy Buds Live, the open ear bean buds. They're so comfortable I've walked into the shower multiple times with them on and just not realizing it. So I was hoping that the Galaxy Buds 3 would be an adequate replacement with better sound and mic quality and they come so so close. They're just as comfortable as the Buds Live, if not more so, and they sound *way* better, but they do sit in your ear more and block more outside sound, and most gallingly, unlike the Buds Pro, they have no transparency / ambient mode!?! Literally just add transparency mode and they would be the perfect buds live replacements, but without it they're just another pair of earbuds."", ""I don't recommend it. It looks very cool and feel cheap. Buds keep falling out of my ears instantly and I don't even feel it. Easy to get damaged or scratches. Don't think it can even come close to water too"", ""Having used the Galaxy Buds 2 for over two years it felt like a no-brainer to upgrade to the latest version. The sound quality is definitely the best I've heard in any earbuds and the swipe/pinch media controls are far better than the annoying touch controls of the Buds 2, but for some reason Samsung decided to get rid of the silicone eartips. Because of this, the headphones simply don't stay in place even when I'm sitting perfectly still, and I have to constantly adjust it to keep them in my ears. They're way too bulky and uncomfortable. The Buds 3 Pro apparently do have silicone tips but they're around $400 after taxes which is really disappointing coming from someone who usually prefers Samsung's products."", 'I bought it a month ago, so far very happy with the performance. A good competition to other brand', 'I bought 6 months ago and having too much problem with sound effects.', 'The earbuds stay in place in my ears even when I move around often or run. You do not have the issue of pausing media by mistakenly touching them. You have to press the earbuds for most commands. A very responsive voice command allows you to pause, skip, rewind, etc. So you can also control them without touching the buds. When I make calls as well, the audio quality is quite clear. The left and right earbuds allow you to select different actions when you push them e.g. start an app. They also sit comfortably when I put them on. I did not expect that I would enjoy the earbuds this much due to reviews I saw online, however, it has been a delight using them.', ""I only got these headphones because it was included in a Black Friday deal on a phone, otherwise I wouldn't have. In retrospect, I wish I'd gone with a different deal because these are awful. They don't fit well, they constantly feel loose or fall out of my ear entirely. I find them incredibly uncomfortable. Even when I use the noise cancellation feature, if I'm somewhere loud, such as walking in traffic, I can barely hear my music. I can't figure out the touch controls, they're not intuitive and I don't even bother most of the time. These are really awful and I do not recommend them for anyone."", ""I'm very pleased with these earbuds. I needed something to replaced the wired set I was using and this is the perfect option. Fit and function are very good. Can keep them in all day without ear pain. Call quality and music both sound great too. I opted for these over the Pro because I don't find rubber tips to be comfortable for extended use."", 'These Buds 3 are very good quality got them from Best Buy and also came with a free clip case. The only issues with these is that it only supports Samsung phone! I have an iPhone and no use if you have an iPhone cause only what you can do is just connecting with Bluetooth and listening. None of the features you can use with the Buds 3 if you have an iPhone. There was a Galaxy Buds app on iOS and I downloaded and it was updated 3 years ago! It only had old earbuds on the list. I’m going to return these back. But if you are an Samsung user it’s very good and loud and all features work.', ""I purchased these after reading the good reviews for their audio quality. I put them in my ear, and they fell out with minimal movement after only a minute. I could use them as long as I sat still, and the sound was pretty good when they did work. Again, I cannot walk or talk with them, or I'll lose one or both. I did cleaned the tips and my ears, which helped for two minutes before the same problem arose. If you are used to AirPods with the same design, these might work for you; otherwise, I suggest pumping out the extra hundred for the Pros with the rubber tips.""]"

JBL Vibe Buds True Wireless Headphones - White Open Box,$49.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/jbl-vibe-buds-true-wireless-headphones-white-open-box/17087856/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These are perry decent earbuds for the price. And as always with JBL products, the best thing about these earbuds is the sound quality!!! Excellent highs and very good bass, with nothing missing in between!! I use these at work and when doing chores around the house and rarely do i need to adjust the buds (from falling out). The charging case has no lid on it, but the magnets that hold the earbuds in the case for charging seem extra strong and i an not worrying about the buds falling out. Plus the edge of the case extends above where the earbuds sit so it will be real hard to knock out of the case. My one gripe would be the length of the charging cord. A couple more inches would be enough, but as it is now, the case doesn't sit flush on my counter when plugged in. Small gripe, but something i noticed right away and has stayed in my mind since. Charging is quick and the Bassey life seems long in my use."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love the sound of these ear buds. I have use them at night while going to bed, and I have used it in a crowded area. The best part about the ear buds is if you download the JBL app you can change the sound to how you like to hear your music. Example vocal, bass, jazz, super bass. You can also change how you hear noise around you. When I was in the crowded area I tuned the noises out. When I wanted to hear people talking I adjusted to hear them. The only thing I did not like about these earbuds was they kept falling out of my ears I did try the different sizes but I must have a small ear. Other than that the battery last long, they fit right in my purse, and they were very easy to link up to any Bluetooth device.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Vibe Buds are a great pair of ear buds to add to your collection. They are small and sleek with a case that recharges your buds for you. They are dust and water resistant, which is amazing, since the wind is like no other here in Colorado. They also have the feature of having a Wi-Fi phone conversation. This hands free way of chatting it up is convenient and effective. The buds do cancel out background noise in order to have the conversation. The lack of one star is because these earbuds do not stay in my ears. They fall out if I move around too much.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love these JBL VIBE Buds, my everyday goto. If I'm out for a walk, I take the JBL VIBE Buds.

JBL always has a good build, sleek look and awesome sound."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Ok earphones, grate for walks and gym time. Usted them at work during lunchtime to listen to youtube videos and not disturb others. I also used them at the gym, just that the fit in my ear was not that great would keep falling out. They were not that comfortable after like 2 hours of using them.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am in love with JBL’s Vibe buds. First off, they are so easy to connect via Bluetooth. They just connect to your device upon picking the JBL vibe buds from the drop-down in your Bluetooth menu of your device. That’s all. They sound is off the charts. It’s so crisp and clear that they are truly superb. They come with different size tips so they fit perfectly in anyone’s ears. They are so light and comfortable, sometimes I forget I’m even wearing them. Unlike other pricier buds, they don’t fall out of your ears at all. The buds click inside the case for charging and the case holds charge itself after charging it up. The case holds charge for days and the buds stay charged for hours and hours. I use them everyday and in only charge the case once a week. Twice at the very most. The have ambient control so you can hear in the background if you need to. JBL has an app for easier use, ambient controls, an equalizer and more. I love the you can control volume and pause just by tapping your buds. The buds automatically pause if you take one out which is so awesome. You can also take phone calls thru your buds, which is also a big plus. The quality of JBL vibe buds is excellent. I’m sure the way I take care of things, but, even if you’re careless, these buds are gonna last you. Overall, I love everything about JBL vibe bugs and I highly recommend.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love my vibe buds! They are extremely comfortable, I even fell asleep while wearing them. They fit securely in my ear and I was able to take long distant walks without them falling out. The sound is incredible, crystal clear and they cancel outside noise. I have taken numerous calls with my vibe buds and the calls were clear and the people I talked to confirmed I sounded clear on their end as well. I appreciate that there is not a lid on the case so it’s easy to access my ear buds. Pairing my earbuds with my device was simple and they paired quickly within seconds. The battery life is incredible and I have used them for multiple hours for days and still didn’t need charged. When I did charger them it didn’t take long to charge up. Love these earbuds with one compliment no way to turn up the volume on the actual ear bud only volume up or down on device. I would recommend.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Vibe Buds are small. I wasn't sure if they would stay in place in my ear. I was wrong. These little, lightweight buds, once fitted with the correct size silicon tip, not only fit well but very comfortably. Almost unnoticeable unless you had something playing through them. The Vibe Buds, connected to my phone very fast and I was up and running. The sound from the buds was very crisp and had some very good low end, the true JBL sound, if you will. These Vibe Buds are a choice for your personal work out, or just sitting back and listening. I would highly recommend these dynamic buds."", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As par for the course the audio is on point. Seamless integration right in to JBL's Headphone app for customizable button configuration and personalized EQ settings for that perfect sound you will enjoy. I have really narrow ear passages and these were super snug. I was definitely confident that they would not fall out but after prolonged wear (1+hrs) there was a bit of discomfort. At first unboxing I was a bit uncertain if I would like or mind the open case/charger design. The buds were easy to remove and place in the charge case and they did not fall out. There is a certain satisfaction from opening a case and closing it though. The markings for left and right are marked in a tiny dimple and are impossible to read. I found it easier to place them in the case and figure out which one was left and right then to try read the tiny letter. Battery Longevity was great and the mentioned 10 min charge can give you 2 hours of play at normal volumes. At the time of this review, I have not had any opportunity to perform any hands free calls but the battery."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Vibe Buds are great! Another quality sounding ear bud from JBL. I barely pulled off the protective cover on the ear buds and they were already pairing with my phone, easy enough. The battery life on the buds is phenomenal - up to 32 hours plus the 10 minute speed charge is pretty cool, giving you 2 hours more play time in a pinch. I had no problem with the fit of these earbuds, they stayed in place and literally the longer I wear them they become practically unnoticeable. Love the quick touch features on the buds, very responsive unlike others I have had. I really like the Ambient Aware feature, especially when walking.

Some of the impressive features I like: 1. The size and fit without protruding outside the ear. 2. Tapping on the left ear bud turns on amient sound or noise cancellation. 3. You can pause the songs using the right ear bud. 4. Bluetooth connectivity was instantaneous....no delay whatsoever. 5. Very clear phone conversations with no noticeable background noise heard. 6. 48 hours total music time... incredible!!! Short story.... I listening to music when without noise canceling while my mother in law was visiting. A conversation insued about dinner and that when i decided to select noise canceling... haha, worked perfect. I will say, these were the only ear buds that took me a while of trying the small, medium, and large ear cups to determine the best fitment.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Tune Buds have good sound and great battery life. Pairing process was easy, open the case and search for the buds using the Bluetooth setting. Came with a USB-A to USB-C orange cable. Ear caps can be easily exchanged for smaller or larger ones, medium was the default fit and those worked for me. The JBL Tune Buds also come with the JBL Headphones app, here you have more control of the different features it comes with like noice canceling. Sound quality for both phones calls and music are good, they sound good at high volume and other caller can hear my voice loud and clear. I got about 30 hours of play time from a single charge on both headphones and case at 75% volume level so battery is good! The only weird thing about them is that even after taking them off and placing them in the case the audio will continue to play, I had to go to Bluetooth settings to manually disconnect from the Tune Buds. Overall I'm happy with this product!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Tune Buds are a pair of true wireless earbuds that are a comfortable fit, good sound quality, and effective active noise cancellation. The earbuds are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips to ensure a snug fit. They have a touch-sensitive control panel that allows you to play, pause, skip tracks, and answer calls. The earbuds also have an IPX4 rating, making them sweat and water resistant. The sound quality is good. The bass is boosted, but it doesn't overpower the mids and highs. The earbuds also have a good soundstage, which makes it feel like the music is coming from all around you. The active noise cancellation is effective at blocking out low-frequency noise, such as the sound of an airplane engine or the hum of a fan. It's not as effective at blocking out high-frequency noise, such as the sound of voices or traffic. The only thing missing from this is that it is a little loose fit in my ears, I can't use it while workout, but if you are a confortable place, it is a perfect pair."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The pros: • The sound quality for these earbuds is impressive, especially considering their form factor. The overall range is what I would expect for much larger devices (such as over the ear headphones), as well as the warmth and tone of sound. The mic is pretty good too—people I called said that the sound was clear and not an issue at all. • The app adds a lot of additional features, and my favorite is the equalizer. Once the app is installed, you can choose from among several pre-set equalizer modes (jazz, vocal, bass, club, studio, or extreme bass) or can create your own custom settings. Depending on what type of music I’m listening to (or whether it’s an audiobook, phone call, or video conference), I find myself adjusting the equalizer to enhance the sound… and love that I can clearly distinguish the differences and that the visuals help me better understand what I’m adjusting and why it’s making a difference. • I have small ears and usually struggle with earbuds like these, but this set is super lightweight and comfortable and stays in pretty well. I can leave these in for a couple of hours while walking around without having to constantly adjust them back into place, which is a huge plus, but I doubt they’d stay in if I was heading out for a run or anything that would bumps them out. • The active noise cancelling is fine, but not amazing. There’s a clear difference between ANC, ambient aware, and talk through. The ANC blocks most noise, but not everything—maybe 80% effectiveness or so. It’s better than you can generally find with this type of earbud, so I don’t think this is unreasonable at all… and I probably need to test out different eartips for a while to see if that helps. • I love that the app allows you to decide what gestures on each earbud control. I also appreciate that there’s a max volume limiter to help protect your hearing… something I’m Increasingly thinking about. The cons: • I wish the case and a little loop or something that would make it easy to use a mini carabiner to attach it to a keychain to make it easy to carry all of the time. I know I could buy a silicone cover with a carabiner, but I wish it were possible to just attach a mini carabiner to the original case since it seems plenty sturdy without additional protection. • The first time I used these for a phone call, it’s almost as if the earbuds were slightly out of sync. I could still engage in the conversation just fine, but the slight delay was a bit distracting. I’m hoping this was just a first-use fluke since it hasn’t been a problem since then (after 3 days of use with several hours each day).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are light and comfortable with excellent sound. I like the case as well. I like that the case is easy to open. That may seem something obvious, but it isn't always the case (pun intended). They aren't great for active use, but for walking or listening to music, they are excellent. They also work well for talking on the phone. I really like them for daily use. They have ANC and ambient aware features as well. They can be configured with the JBL Headphones App to apply EQ adjustments and set the controls to your liking. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. They are feature rich!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the sound quality, works amazing for music, good call quality too but I felt it lose in my ears.

Gonna use it during travel.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These ear buds sound great.Its bass mids and highs are perfectly tuned out the box.The noise canceling is easy to turn on and off.

On to the instructions and other contents. A type “C” charging cable under 12” Hmmmmmm! And there are simple yet somewhat effective drawing so to get started. Print is on the small side and not-so-easy to read. VIEWPOINT: Earbuds seem to come in two varieties. The first is the preferred set that if lost or damaged a replacement is very soon in hand. And the second is if lost or damaged, oh well, I will replace someday if ever. These earbud fall in the first category. They work, they function, they do what they are designed to do, and do it quite well QUALITY OF SOUND: To my ears the hardest sounds to reproduce are the human voice and the piano. Did these ear buds manage quality reproduction – Kind Of. Were the earbuds acceptable reproducing voice and piano – close but not quite there. “Pure Bass” is promoted on the box. Does not mean louder bass, My ears tell me the bass is decent, reasonably balanced, not over powering. EASE OF SETUP: Downloaded the app via the QR code included. Yet took me three tries to get left and right earbuds connected to my phone. Guessing it is operator induced error or my phone had issues with the Tone buds. May never know. MANUAL CONTROLS: To do various things, such as answer a call,factory reset noise cancelling and other functions a series of taps and long holds are required. A little practice helps. Now the noise canceling worked kind of. Some canceling out my wife’s TV shows while I listened to music. The ultimate test will be on an airplane. This will be answered in a few months. I am hopeful. HEADPHONE APP: I do like the app. As for tone controls, choices are jazz, studio and others. I preferred the studio as almost flat in the response. The app is simple to operate and use. OVERALL: The Tune Buds do produce excellent sound listening to music, watching a movie, podcasts and so on. Not as good as I had hoped via phone call. Not sure why. I am still amazed the sound of such a small package.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Tune Buds fit great. They work great for both working out and in the coffee shop. I frequently use the ambient aware, noise canceling, and standard mode depending on the context. Switching between the settings is easy. The noise canceling dampens just enough to make it nice when the coffee shop gets louder. I like the pure bass. It's overwhelming but gives good sound, not muffled. They fit in my ears well. I noticed the ear piece is more oval now than just round. I have not had any connectivity issues. It connects to both my phone and laptop with ease. The app helped me to get my Tune Buds settings the way I wanted it. I just wish there was a little bit of grip to the buds and the case. It's a little slippery. They work great for a call or video calling, but not in a noisy area.""]"

The quality of sound is very good, have a good balance. If you use it for calling, the person will hear you very clearly without any problem of cutting. About cutting, my music was never cut during my test, you can easily moving from the bluetooth transmitter around 5 meters easily. Very good point for the autonomy and its recharge : JBL says 10 hours, and i can confirm, finish to be afraid of low battery, for a moderate sport (6 hours by weeks) in two weeks i recharge it only once. The recharge is very fast with the cable-c (10 min of recharge give 1 hour of listening).

With lower frequency sounds these earbuds over do it too the max and tune ability is very limited to over come this problem. I Don’t recommend this product for the true music enthusiasts as the sound is questionable to say the least! I’m my opinion would say you can definitely get way better Sound quality in similar priced earbuds so beware of JBL headphones there my about hype than natural sound .', ""I bought these earphones to accompany me on my running outings, because I was tired of the wire wandering around as well as the earphone coming out of the ear, I wanted something solid, which resists to drops of water and perspiration. the bet is held the earphones hold very well in the ear with the possibility of changing the diameter of the earphone. they don't interfere with running.I only had a technical problem with one of the two headphones working less than the other, so the impression that the sound came out better on one side.

However, the 'low battery' alert plays at 30%, every minute or so, making it unusable for a third of the capacity.

If you can get behind the most that poorly designed aspect, then great earphones to have."", ""Generally good product but the low battery alarm essentially means the last 20% is wasted unless you're willing to be blasted repeatedly by a low battery warning. Like seriously it's louder than what I'm listening to and mutes it so you miss it. Whatever happened to a flashing red light......"", ""I never once got anywhere close to the advertised battery life. When they were new I got maybe five hours at best. The low battery warning sound comes on when the battery is at around 20%. This completely interrupts playback, but doesn't pause it, meaning that you miss 5 seconds+ of audio. Annoying when listening to music, unusable for narrative like a podcast or audio book. The fit is comfortable enough, but the ear buds get loose quickly, and can easily be lost. Audio quality is okay. I wasn't expecting exceptional quality for the price, and I got what I paid for"", 'Bought over a month ago and now they no longer charge or turn on.

The rubber ear tips are also very tight on the earbuds and won't pop off and get lost like others that I've had. Clear sound quality, deep bass. Lightweight, great battery life, great price. I will definitely continue to buy this brand."", ""The in-ear experience of these earphones is really great. My girlfriend has difficulties regarding in-ear earphones as they do not stay in place and she has no issues with them. Furthermore, the natural noise cancellation is particularly great! We don't feel like we're diving when talking (you know, the specific sound you have whenever you make a sound internally or try to speak when you have in-ear earphones?), big sounds are still there as there is no active noise cancellation but it is still very sufficient for daily usage. Great to use when doing sport as they don't pop out of the ears and having magnetic buds is a nice little feature whenever you need to take them off and keep them around the neck for example. At this price point, it's a bargain.""]"

In fact i changed my mind not to buy JBL over ear headphone which I was thinking to buy', ""I was initially quite happy with the sound quality of the headphones, especially for the fair price. About 2 months in, the rubber covers around the headphones(the part that goes into the ear) fell off. This wasn't a big deal, they were still comfortable inside the ears.

It really sucks, I can no longer listen to anything without getting annoyed by it."", ""We just got these in at the store I work at, the first thing I did was read some reviews on these and a lot of the reviews are really negative so I immediately thought these wouldn't be very good. One day when I was supposed to do inventory I realized I forgot my headphones so I bought a pair of these and I have to say I am very impressed. The sound is nice and clear, the bass is apparent and is strong without overwhelming the audio experience.

Esses são os dois pontos negativos que observei, o cabo e a fixação na orelha, de resto esse fone manda muito bem, um excelente substituto para o fone da apple (com cabo p2 para aqueles que n querem um overEar ou inEar).

You can pause the songs using the right ear bud. 4. Bluetooth connectivity was instantaneous....no delay whatsoever. 5. Very clear phone conversations with no noticeable background noise heard. 6. 48 hours total music time... incredible!!! Short story.... I listening to music when without noise canceling while my mother in law was visiting. A conversation insued about dinner and that when i decided to select noise canceling... haha, worked perfect. I will say, these were the only ear buds that took me a while of trying the small, medium, and large ear cups to determine the best fitment.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Tune Buds have good sound and great battery life. Pairing process was easy, open the case and search for the buds using the Bluetooth setting. Came with a USB-A to USB-C orange cable. Ear caps can be easily exchanged for smaller or larger ones, medium was the default fit and those worked for me. The JBL Tune Buds also come with the JBL Headphones app, here you have more control of the different features it comes with like noice canceling. Sound quality for both phones calls and music are good, they sound good at high volume and other caller can hear my voice loud and clear. I got about 30 hours of play time from a single charge on both headphones and case at 75% volume level so battery is good! The only weird thing about them is that even after taking them off and placing them in the case the audio will continue to play, I had to go to Bluetooth settings to manually disconnect from the Tune Buds. Overall I'm happy with this product!"", ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The JBL Tune Buds are a pair of true wireless earbuds that are a comfortable fit, good sound quality, and effective active noise cancellation. The earbuds are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips to ensure a snug fit. They have a touch-sensitive control panel that allows you to play, pause, skip tracks, and answer calls. The earbuds also have an IPX4 rating, making them sweat and water resistant. The sound quality is good. The bass is boosted, but it doesn't overpower the mids and highs. The earbuds also have a good soundstage, which makes it feel like the music is coming from all around you. The active noise cancellation is effective at blocking out low-frequency noise, such as the sound of an airplane engine or the hum of a fan. It's not as effective at blocking out high-frequency noise, such as the sound of voices or traffic. The only thing missing from this is that it is a little loose fit in my ears, I can't use it while workout, but if you are a confortable place, it is a perfect pair."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The pros: • The sound quality for these earbuds is impressive, especially considering their form factor. The overall range is what I would expect for much larger devices (such as over the ear headphones), as well as the warmth and tone of sound. The mic is pretty good too—people I called said that the sound was clear and not an issue at all. • The app adds a lot of additional features, and my favorite is the equalizer. Once the app is installed, you can choose from among several pre-set equalizer modes (jazz, vocal, bass, club, studio, or extreme bass) or can create your own custom settings. Depending on what type of music I’m listening to (or whether it’s an audiobook, phone call, or video conference), I find myself adjusting the equalizer to enhance the sound… and love that I can clearly distinguish the differences and that the visuals help me better understand what I’m adjusting and why it’s making a difference. • I have small ears and usually struggle with earbuds like these, but this set is super lightweight and comfortable and stays in pretty well. I can leave these in for a couple of hours while walking around without having to constantly adjust them back into place, which is a huge plus, but I doubt they’d stay in if I was heading out for a run or anything that would bumps them out. • The active noise cancelling is fine, but not amazing. There’s a clear difference between ANC, ambient aware, and talk through. The ANC blocks most noise, but not everything—maybe 80% effectiveness or so. It’s better than you can generally find with this type of earbud, so I don’t think this is unreasonable at all… and I probably need to test out different eartips for a while to see if that helps. • I love that the app allows you to decide what gestures on each earbud control. I also appreciate that there’s a max volume limiter to help protect your hearing… something I’m Increasingly thinking about. The cons: • I wish the case and a little loop or something that would make it easy to use a mini carabiner to attach it to a keychain to make it easy to carry all of the time. I know I could buy a silicone cover with a carabiner, but I wish it were possible to just attach a mini carabiner to the original case since it seems plenty sturdy without additional protection. • The first time I used these for a phone call, it’s almost as if the earbuds were slightly out of sync. I could still engage in the conversation just fine, but the slight delay was a bit distracting. I’m hoping this was just a first-use fluke since it hasn’t been a problem since then (after 3 days of use with several hours each day).', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These headphones are light and comfortable with excellent sound. I like the case as well. I like that the case is easy to open. That may seem something obvious, but it isn't always the case (pun intended). They aren't great for active use, but for walking or listening to music, they are excellent. They also work well for talking on the phone. I really like them for daily use. They have ANC and ambient aware features as well. They can be configured with the JBL Headphones App to apply EQ adjustments and set the controls to your liking. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. They are feature rich!"", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the sound quality, works amazing for music, good call quality too but I felt it lose in my ears. I tried all the buds that came with it but still they didn’t fit properly in my ears. Overall they’re a good pair of earbuds with good noise cancellation. Gonna use it during travel.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These ear buds sound great.Its bass mids and highs are perfectly tuned out the box.The noise canceling is easy to turn on and off. The controls left and right ear have different functions and that's the only thing you have to get used to.I found myself skipping a song instead of turning off noise canceling.The battery seems to last long even with noise canceling on.I don't have hour estimates since i dont use for more than a hour or two at a time.Jbl says 10 hours to 30 h depending on volume.These are light and fit snug so daily wear shouldn't be a problem."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] JBL TUNE BUDS Opened the case, verified the earbud in the case and set to charging the units. On to the instructions and other contents. A type “C” charging cable under 12” Hmmmmmm! And there are simple yet somewhat effective drawing so to get started. Print is on the small side and not-so-easy to read. VIEWPOINT: Earbuds seem to come in two varieties. The first is the preferred set that if lost or damaged a replacement is very soon in hand. And the second is if lost or damaged, oh well, I will replace someday if ever. These earbud fall in the first category. They work, they function, they do what they are designed to do, and do it quite well QUALITY OF SOUND: To my ears the hardest sounds to reproduce are the human voice and the piano. Did these ear buds manage quality reproduction – Kind Of. Were the earbuds acceptable reproducing voice and piano – close but not quite there. “Pure Bass” is promoted on the box. Does not mean louder bass, My ears tell me the bass is decent, reasonably balanced, not over powering. EASE OF SETUP: Downloaded the app via the QR code included. Yet took me three tries to get left and right earbuds connected to my phone. Guessing it is operator induced error or my phone had issues with the Tone buds. May never know. MANUAL CONTROLS: To do various things, such as answer a call,factory reset noise cancelling and other functions a series of taps and long holds are required. A little practice helps. Now the noise canceling worked kind of. Some canceling out my wife’s TV shows while I listened to music. The ultimate test will be on an airplane. This will be answered in a few months. I am hopeful. HEADPHONE APP: I do like the app. As for tone controls, choices are jazz, studio and others. I preferred the studio as almost flat in the response. The app is simple to operate and use. OVERALL: The Tune Buds do produce excellent sound listening to music, watching a movie, podcasts and so on. Not as good as I had hoped via phone call. Not sure why. I am still amazed the sound of such a small package.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] These Tune Buds fit great. They work great for both working out and in the coffee shop. I frequently use the ambient aware, noise canceling, and standard mode depending on the context. Switching between the settings is easy. The noise canceling dampens just enough to make it nice when the coffee shop gets louder. I like the pure bass. It's overwhelming but gives good sound, not muffled. They fit in my ears well. I noticed the ear piece is more oval now than just round. I have not had any connectivity issues. It connects to both my phone and laptop with ease. The app helped me to get my Tune Buds settings the way I wanted it. I just wish there was a little bit of grip to the buds and the case. It's a little slippery. They work great for a call or video calling, but not in a noisy area.""]"

I even have some 1more triple drive iems but I actually prefer wearing these. For everyone who is saying they do not have any bass, please use the different size tips.

The only time I experienced headphones this bad was when I bought a novelty set in a bargain store once.

Also, I can hear the chatter of those around me on the bus when I'm using them which is annoying! I have customised the sound settings but it's no better.

Wish the battery life was a little longer. The earbuds allow you to move freely during workout within worrying about having a bulky set of headphones or wires hanging around your neck. The sound is good, crisp highs and decent bass. Will monitor to see if battery life improves but having the charger case makes charging a snap. I also like the color.', ""I bought these last year as a gift before deciding to keep them for myself. I still to this day tell people that this was my best buy ever!

I will try again today after leaving work to see if I'm able to get more than an hour of listening time."", ""I have to say I heard through a friend about these wireless earbuds so I decided to purchase a pair, I must say for the amount they charged and the sound quality, perfect! These headphones are mint. They fit in the ear one very specific way for people that say that they fall out. There are various sizes earbuds with the product and once they are correctly placed into your ear they sound phenomenal. I don't think there is a better earbud out there for the price with such crisp clean sound, base is perfect not overwhelming and the treble and midridge is on point. These are perfect earbud if you want to drown out outside noises from around you all while listening to crisp clean sounding music. I'll be honest I'd like to get another pair of these somehow.

I've gone through so many wired headphones that would go back because of the cord.Switched to the Sol Republic Track Air. Only issue I had with them were the bulky feel off the band and ear pieces during my workouts. Saw these and immediately had to get them. The look like they would be heavy and fit in my ear perfectly. Rarely do they ever fall out of my ears during workouts. Sound quality is amazing and they have good range away from my phone. I can walk across almost the whole gym without losing connection. Only issue is occasional pairing issues. Usually can be fixed by putting them both on the charger or double clicking them at the same time to get them to pair."", 'I bought them Sep. 5th and I pretty much waited a week for these “bad boys” to come in oh sorry let me take that back “sorry boys” I’m actually really disappointed I can’t believe it I mean everything was faulty the charger seemed to not be charging my right ear bud (I finnaly got it to charge) once both earbuds were fully charge I started to pair not a chance they paired I put them on my ear and played music my Right earphone stopped sound completely it’s like it gave up on life my left earphone it felt like it was fighting it kept cutting and producing sound at some point they completely stop making sound but they were still paired to my IPhone 7 Plus I paused the music and it paused it *but no sound take in mind* I’m trully dissatisfied with this product I love Sol I bought some Bluetooth/Wired headphones that lasted me 5 YEARS which is amazing considering I used them daily with some minor drops they sadly stopped working (the bluethooth at least) so I decided to not interest myself in Beats or Bose but go ahead and buy from Sol again.... I want to give these things a second chance but as of now my rating will stay', 'have owned these for about 3 months. they are awful in busy places. the bluetooth cuts off when there is lots of people using bluetooth. you can literally watch someone walk in front of you and the headphones cut out for a couple of seconds. when this happens over and over again it can be super annoying. getting the buds to sync up eachother is also a challenge. sometimes they want to double pair to your phone separately not together so one bud gets the sound. it has literally taken me half an hour to get them to link back together. several times!!!', ""I have now owned the Sol Republic Amp Airs for one month now and I can confirm that I am disappointed. Overall the build quality is great on both the charging/carry case and the Amp Airs, I love the feel of the button as you know when it has been pressed. The Bluetooth connectivity between both the mobile device to both ear pods is quite astonishingly bad and trying to connect both earphones together is a disaster as it takes on average a couple of minutes. The sound quality from both music and calls is minimal, nothing special at all and can easily be compared with an 'off the shelf' ear pod from an everyday store. This product is not worth what I paid for them and it is a regrettable purchase. Spend a little extra for a pair and thank me later"", 'Overall very good headphones. The sound quality is great, they don’t fall out while I’m running, and the battery life is awesome. However, The connection and synchronization process can be quite glitchy and unpredictable at times. Often it will take several tries to connect properly and if you have competing signals that could be a problem. But I’ve had my Amps for a couple years now and they are durable. I also have to add, the design is very well done - discreet and aesthetic; far superior to the ugly AirPods']"
House Of Marley Rebel In-Ear True Wireless Earbuds - Signature Black,$99.99,https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/house-of-marley-rebel-in-ear-true-wireless-earbuds-signature-black/15560465/review,"[""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Rebel True Wireless Earbuds are an overall good choice if you're after a pair of wireless earbuds. The audio quality is average/ good however I would personally like more bass. There are two audio equalizer presets you can choose from, however I couldn't really tell much difference between the sound stages so this feature might be a bit of a gimmick. The earbuds themselves look nice and is a nice change from seeing the all white Apple Earpod alternatives. The touch controls work well however there is no audio feedback to confirm that your touch was registered. This is something I'm used to on other earphones so it's a bit weird turn up the volume by tapping without knowing that your tap is being registered. Taking one of the earbuds out of your ear pauses the music which is a nice feature, and putting the earbud back into your ear resumes music play. The case is compact and well made and the magnets guide the earbuds into the correct charging position. These type of earbuds never really seem to stay into my ears, no matter which size of ear tip I tried (3 sizes include in the box), these earbuds would always eventually fall out of my ears. This will be different for every person, however this design just doesn't work well for me. I much prefer the galaxy buds 2 which have a wing tip for a more secure hold. Personally, the worst feature for me is that each earbud has a light that flashes every 6 seconds or so to show that they are connected. I think this makes the earbuds look cheap and the light is obnoxious. Tried these out on my android phone and there was no trouble with the Bluetooth connection. Overall, solid set of earbuds but I believe there are better alternatives out there."", '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The sound quality is great with these ear phones with good bass and a really clear sound when listening to music. In terms of volume and quality these ear phones match any over ear head phones which I have owned in the past. The build and style of these are exactly what you expect from house of Marley and feel/look very high end which is great for the price range One criticism I would have is that the touch controls can be quite fidgety however this would not be enough to put me off buying these as they are a great product.', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Arrived in excellent packaging. First thing I noticed is the quality of the product. The bamboo surface gives it a premium feel to the product. The charging cable also feel strong and sturdy. The headphone has really snug fit to my ears. I mostly use it at the gym its never fall off my ears, even whilst running on the treadmill. The sound quality is excellent. The mic is always pretty good. Other headset I had difficulty whilst talking on the phone but no complaint for no one so far. The bluetooth has a good range. I can walk around the room with phone and desk but it never cuts off.', 'Like many other reviewers that have left comments here, I am experiencing similar issues of the headphones randomly disconnecting, only allowing audio through one earbud, or refusing to connect to my device. Even after forgetting Rebel from all devices and just trying to get it running on my brand new iPad again, they won’t work. My use of this website on my iPad is a mess because the page just bounces around when I am trying to read reviews or support comments. It makes me wonder if these folks use their own product.', ""[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So happy with these ear buds! The packaging alone is high quality and the ear buds themselves are so smart looking, love the case they come in the wood effect really does look great. They're really easy to set up and the instructions are clear to read, only thing i found that was missing was how to pause but soon figured out that once you remove and ear bud it will stop playing and then resume once put back in which is great. The sound quality is brilliant would highly recommend, overall im really pleased with these"", ""Didn't fit my left ear very uncomfortable plus could not get the left ear bud to play the previous track sent back the ear buds had the champion ones and fancied a knew set of ear buds thought I would upgrade to these but it was more of a downgrade as these did not sound at all as good as the champion ear buds I await the replacement ear buds if they are better than the defective set sent back I will keep them if not will have to send them back and get ear buds with the same in ear shape as the champion buds"", 'The audio quality is very average for the price. Champions had better base even if it is an inferior model. It falls off very easily. Hard to work out, light jogging or even eating doesn’t matter the silicone piece used. The controls are kinda bad. It is long to change the volume without skipping a song. No pause option. Connectivity issues around a lot of people (Airports for example). This earbuds might not be really worth it, but House of Marley have a great costumer service. (At least in Canada)', 'These look really good, sound is excellent, connectivity is fantastic and it’s so nice to be able to make more environmentally conscious purchases when it comes to electronics. I only have one issue with these, hence the 4 star rating. The tap touch controls are awful, I’d prefer there wasn’t any way of controlling them from the earbud itself. If you want to call somebody randomly from your phone book who you’ve not spoken to in 11 years, these are for you.', 'I really wanted these to work out and I wanted to support the Marley company, there’s greatness in the name Marley. Sadly, my earbuds just won’t live up to the quality one would expect from Marley. They won’t charge up even after 8 hours I will get maybe an hour of listening pleasure. I spent a bit on these and now I wish I hadn’t. I love the idea behind this product but someone at House of Marley needs to look into why so many customers are having issues.', 'I’m not sure whether it’s my ears - probably not - but the volume is super low when I crank it ALL the way up on my iPhone 13. It’s extremely disappointing and I’m not sure if I’m going to be buying another HoM product. I had high hopes, but unfortunately the reviews I read online that describe the Rebel as mediocre are spot on. Also debating whether to return this Rebel pair since it’s still within the 30-day window of purchase.']"

My biggest problem with both is the losses of the ear size rubbers. I've had to glue the magnetic block because it's easy to come loose and slide off while I'm mechanicing. Now it just spins the charging port to the front from laying down and getting up. It stays on unless you lose Bluetooth connection or it dies and now I might have a bad wire in one ear now."", 'I tried these out and I really wish they were better. The form-factor is really handy. You can throw them around your neck and forget they’re there. Audio quality is passable, but not amazing. The bass is a bit over the top, but not distractingly. The rest of the soundscape is fine. My main complaint is the hiss during quiet parts of a song. It’s really quite distracting. I was disappointed that they were only able to connect to a single device at a time. I like to connect to both my computer and phone. It’s pretty easy to disconnect from one device and connect to another, so it’s more of an annoyance than a problem.', ""These have great sound quality, especially for such small/lightweight ear buds - and I've used them a lot for phone calls too. I've asked people about the quality of the sound they can hear and they've commented how I sound a lot clearer than my usual headsets (sorry Sony and Sennheiser!) which was one of the worries I had prior to buying these. Haven't used them for running yet - which was my main purpose for buying them - but have used them while hiking and walking and the magnet has been sturdy without feeling heavy around my neck. Only very small gripe is the holding bag feels very cheap and I'm not sure if it's made out of recycled materials as per everything else."", ""I'm a huge fan of House of Marley products. I own the liberate XLBT, Chant BT speaker, Positive vibrations 2 and more, and I have never had a bad experience till now, the uplift 2 wireless earphones have great sound quality as always, but the Bluetooth connectivity is awful, I can't even put my phone in my pocket without them loosing connection, I have to put my phone inside my hood or carry it in my hand use them, this is very disappointing"", 'I got these earphones a while ago and I am so glad I did! They are a great pair of earphones. The music quality is excellent! I don’t usually buy earphones with rubber ear buds but these are very comfortable in my ears! I also extremely like the fact that the earphones have a clip at the back to clip onto clothes as it stops me worrying I may lose them if they come off. I have been using these earphones for journeys and also regularly when I go to the gym. I am loving that I don’t have to keep my phone comnected by a wire that always gets in the way. I would definitely recommend these earphones!', ""Ive used the Uplift 2 Wireless headphones at work for about 3 weeks now, They paired with my iPhone with ease and are great as a hands free set. I've also been listening to Spotify. I didn't think the bass response was great and got my work colleagues to check, we found that if you jam them hard into your ear the bass response is better, make sure you select the correct size rubber to allow deep insertion. I guess if your active you do ram them in to stop then falling out, sitting in an office it can be quite uncomfortable especially when interrupted and have to whip them out then jam in again. The from new battery life is good, Ive often managed 2 days on a charge. Cant comment on longevity of the battery of braided cables."", 'I bought these earphones a few weeks ago and have been using them since day 1. I have bought and tried many earphones but these one are by far my favourite. When ordering these was skeptic as I had never tried wireless earphones before, however I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved them from the first wear. The design is Simple yet perfect, they come with 2 different size ear buds which it brilliant as normally I cannot keep earphones in my ear as they can be too big but with the smaller size I can choose what fits best for me. The way the earphones are positioned are great! They stay firmly in my ears the whole time and DO NOT fall out which I find with other brands. The sound from them is great too!', 'I bought these in January 2019, over one and a half year ago. After this much use I can say that these are great headphones, with amazing sound quality, very well balanced. I can listen to many different music genres and enjoy them all. Battery life is ok, today it lasts for only 6-7 hours, but it is still not a problem. What keeps me from giving five stars is that, from day one, it would keep cutting my music, depending on how I positioned it around my neck, and having to reposition it all the time to make it work can be quite annoying.', ""I've been using the headphones daily for a week now and am really happy with them. They sound and look really good. Pros - - Music sounds great; most important thing for any headphones! - Really easy to pair with a device - Build materials are lovely, they look great - Comfortable in-ear fit; I can struggle with a lot of in ears due to a tragus piercing, but it's not an issue with these - Simple controls to pause / skip songs - Battery life seems good, I've only had to charge once after using them to and from work for a week Cons - - The cable is a bit too long so really loops out when they're being used - The main block that controls the headphones and sits at the back of the neck is a bit heavy and can pull the cable against your neck"", ""I had some doubts before buying about how the cable design would look and if the battery will be comfortable, and very happy I decided to buy them, they look great! (like a combination of a fashion accessory and earphones), the battery on the back is so light and balanced you never even notice it's there and looks nice as well. Sound quality is also very satisfying, clean and laud enough to feel immersed and block outside noise. My new favorite earphones - 100% recommended, even over some more expensive brands.""]"

It is comfortable, sometimes I forget it is on my ear, the voice control is convenient and working flawlessly - nevertheless the physical controls are also well-placed, the call quality (both directions) is also superb even in a noisy environment. If this one gives up, my next headset will be the Voyager 5200 UC, I don't want anything else."", 'Unfortunately, Broken within few months. I was happy with it but.......', '[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my second 5200 Series while my first one was spoiled after 2 years. However, there is a major design issue found this time. When I put the headset into the charging case (the inside charging compartment), the magnet cannot hold the headset in a position, I need to ""force"" the headset to ""plug"" into the charging pins, but if there is a vibration or slightly touch, it will jump out from the charging pins easily, obviously this is a design issue and both headset and charging case is not match probably. When I try my new 5200 in the old charging case, it don\'t have such issue. On the contrary, when I put my old 5200 into the new charging case, same issue! Very disappointed and shouldn\'t continue to buy at the second time.', ""I was using Legend Voyager and very happy. I've used 3 years, it was very easy to charge and stand was very useful. I 've just bought Voyager 5200 Series and very big disappointed, it was very difficult to charge when you are driving, no stand to keep it, you need to put somewhere in the car. I've checked everywhere online but could not find any stand for this device. Why they did not make charger stand for this device like Voyager Legend. I will send it back and buy again Vayager Legend."", ""I bought the 5200 in October 2919 , it's now January 2020 all i seen to do is charge the earpiece regularly, I bought it because I read it had 7 hours standby, within the 1st month it was losing its charge from battery high , to now, it only holds 5 hours fully charged , so where did the 7 hours standby come from, I knew that I should of bought a jabra earpiece but I gave plantonics another chance as the customer service is very good, much better than their products"", ""I am constantly on my phone and also dictating using Dragon Naturally Speaking. I was constantly changing headsets until now. The product, admittedly expensive, does exactly what I need; it integrates listening to my computer, dictating, answering my office phone (bluetooth enabled) and answering my cell phone; all seamlessly. The sound quality is excellent and Dragon has no trouble understanding me. People on the other end of a phone call can't tell I am on a headset."", 'first months I was impressed, noise canceling could cancel almost every noise, when I was in the kitchen calling my family they could not notice anything or at the street with car noise orin the train with people talking arround me. Suddenly one day during cooking at the kitchen my parents started complaining about the noises that before werent there and noticed all what I was doing, so noise cancelling stopped doing its job properly. mobile is the same, configuration is the same, and tried already to unpair/pair de device with no further effects. my question: why did this happen suddenly ? is it a common thing with this device? have yop planned any update / solution for this? if not, I dont understand why spending such money on this device... with the legend everything worked great throughout years! thanks in advance regards Jos¡e', ""I recently moved from the voyager UC it was very much looking forward to this new device. Everything was great until I start to make phone calls and I noticed that I couldn't hear people speaking very well because I would hear static noise every time the caller spoke. I've tried to reset to factory defaults and made sure firmware was up to date, re-paired but still the same issue. Any help would be appreciated."", 'This is my 3rd Plantronics Bluetooth headset. My last one lasted me 8 years. But gave up on it after only been able to talk for only 1 hour 15 mins on a full charge. This new version sounds really great and has a longer talk time. Will be looking to see how the rubber holds up as they have a habit of breaking down. Plantronics has the features that I need always my first choice when looking for a new Bluetooth device.']"

No power and no light. the package was broken because someone else probably returned these and they just resent them to me. Please ensure your products work before selling them. apparently everyone else has the same problem.', 'These have not ever charged or worked. I bought these just before COVID hit, and every time I tried to charge (sometimes for over 24 hrs), and then press the start button nothing happens. Is there meant to be a light? Cant connect to Bluetooth.', ""These are new and short lived. They won't charge again the red light stays red so not charging. The price was okay but not if they stop working after you've had such little use."", 'If you are listening to uncompressed or high definition music, DO NOT BUY ! It seems these earbuds have been designed for compressed low quality music. As long as you listen to some mp3 it is close to ok, still not well balanced but ok. BUT, as soon as you listen to cleaner files, the very high end frequencies are actually causing physical pain ! Sounds like knives being sharpened inside your ears, most unpleasant earbuds I experienced so far, had to stop after 5 minutes, pain lasted 1/2h... cannot recommend, this is actually dangerous for your earing', ""I bought these earbuds twice. The first pair worked for about a year, and then they started cutting in and out. I tried them with 4 different devices including a brand new smart phone and they still kept cutting out. So I figured it was just a faulty set. So I went and bought another pair. After ONE WEEK they started to cut in and out. I then tried it with other devices and the same problem persisted. Now I have to go and get yet another set of Bluetooth earbuds, but you better believe I'm not getting Smile Jamaica's. I would really like to know what's going wrong with them because it makes no sense. I look at the other reviews and they're so positive. I'd like it if someone got back to me as to why I had such a terrible experience with these headphones."", ""For the price tag, I expected a better fit and a better sound. Turns out the sound is rather very flat with absolutely no bass in it, their lower end models sound so much better. The fit is terrible and I don't understand why they didn't include the L size in the ear gums. (Only comes with two pairs of size M and one of size S) It's rather strange that the right ear bud fitted better than the left one. Tested it with various phones and laptops and it sounds just as bad in all of them."", 'I’ve had several pairs of black Smile Jamaica Wireless Earbuds. They sound great and they look great. They don’t usually last even one year, but the price is right and the warranty is generally good. This time I bought Blue Denim style and I can’t use them at all. The rubber of the neck band is a lot softer and more flexible than the black. Because of this the slip down off my neck and take the ear bud with it. I can’t use the headphones if I have to constantly adjust them, and I’m certain they’ll slip off my neck and be lost if I’m wearing them without the earbuds in my ears. I emailed customer service but never heard back. Do not buy Blue Denim. It’s sad really because the Smile Jamaica Wireless have been discontinued in favour of a 2.0 version. The reviews of that all say the earbuds also fall out.', 'These headphones have great bass and great treble. However, to get the bass, you have to have the correct size rubber earbuds installed (the replaceable rubber gasket that goes in your ear). Unfortunately, these headphones come with 1 pair of small rubber earbuds and 2 pairs of medium earbuds. This is instead of shipping the typical 1 pair each of small, medium, and large. My ears require large rubber earbuds. When I installed the medium ones that came with, I had the same complaint of weak bass that other folks have. Fortunately since I save the rubber earbuds from prior old headphones, I installed a pair of large earbuds from one of those and now the Uplift 2 sounds great. I would give these a 5 star if they came with ALL 3 sizes instead of having to recycle the rubber earbuds from older headphones.', ""They should really say that the volume buttons don't work on androids. Just found out and I'm mad I payed so much. Other than that the sound is decent, not heavy in the bass but I don't mind it. I like the rope detail and the angled fit of the buds. I heard some people finding them uncomfortable but if you are used to angled buds they are fine. I sleep in them and don't see much of a problem. Although, after they wear out (or if I lose them) I won't buy again.""]"
